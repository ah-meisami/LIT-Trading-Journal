October Mastermind Bootcamp
Day 1: Liquidity Mastery
Day 2: Algo Origins
Day 3: Intraday Mastery
Day 4: Algo Mastery


In order to know **where to win**, you first must know **where to lose**.

LQD = volume exchange between buyers & sellers
LQD = magnet of price: building, seeking, collecting, repeating


🟠 Transportation (Vehicle)
🟠 Direction (Destination)
🟠 Gas Station (Institutional LQD, Retail LQD)
🟠 By Identifying Where everyone loosing, We know how where to win


1. Retail LQD (SnR)

1. more time => inviting more buyers\sellers 
2. where is the gas ? 
3. where is the everyone losing ? 
4. identify the OB
5. price goes to the other direction

[01:09:00] Once an OB has been mitigated, it is not relevant anymore

[01:12:00] 
1. Where is the destination? 
2. Where is the LQD
3. How Price go to destination after taking LQD
3. How Price enter the Gas Station and go to destination


- In down-trend, we look for EQH
- In up-trend, we look for EQL

SNR = EQH\EQL LQD
Key Zone LQD
BNR = Break & Retest LQD (BnR)
Trendline LQD


1. Purpose
2. LQD Perspective
3. Expected Outcome

💚🔴🟡 Inducement = Induce Hope, Greed, FOMO 🟡🔴💚

🔥 IDM1 = Continuation Inducement = (Induce Reversal) (HTF inducement) (Main-Trend inducement)
🔥 IDM2 = Reversal Inducement = (Induce Continuation) (LTF inducement) (Internal-Trend inducement)
🔥 IDM3


Internal-Structure = Structure inside the main Structure

SMT = OB inside IDM do not work 


Trend is Bullish => in IDM1 buy below HL
Trend is Bullish => in IDM2 buy below LL

Trend is Bearish => in IDM1 sell above LH
Trend is Bearish => in IDM1 sell above HH

Zoom-In
Zoom-Out

Main-Structure-IDM  ==>> IDM1
Internal-Structure-IDM

IDM is Algorithmic way of doing things:
1. buy below low => target new high
2. sell above high => target new low
3. repeat


HP-setups: (Structure + LQD + IDM)
- Extreme + IDM1
- Extreme + IDM2

Respected Structure
Rejected Structure

IDM1 = Continuation Inducement = induce people to see the reversal trade, but we look at it as a continuation
💚 MM inject **fear** to **trend-line traders** for early reversal 
💚 MM inject **hope** to **reversal traders** for catching new trend line
💚 specifically this reaction happens after reacting from a **false-OB** (SMT)
💚 inducement is a **false-BOS** that make you think from retail perspective something new is gonna happen.
💚 **false-OB** cause **internal-IDM**
💚 **false-OB** cause **fake-BOS**

[02:39:00]
🔴 this is why we do not trade the Structure, we trade Structural Breaks
🔴 we trade Structural Breaks to the Structural Breaks

IDM1 : Retail POV
- induce BO traders 
- induce SnR traders 
- induce SMC traders: See BOS & assume market is reversal & in reality $$$ is being collected to push price
  
[02:39:00]
🔥 BOS is only the **Intent** for price to reverse. dose not have to.
🔥 we need to always think about Buying below * Selling above **Structural Points**

💚🔴🟡 Why we mark out the structure? because structure is the **most form of manipulated LQD** 🟡🔴💚
🔥 Because all of the **Retail Strategy** require the structure for their Strategy.

**BO traders** needs the structure
**SnR traders** needs the structure
**SMC traders** needs the structure

🔥 IDM2 = Reversal Inducement = (Induce Continuation) (LTF inducement) (Internal-Trend inducement)

1. in HTF we have HH HL (bullish trend)
2. after HTF BOS we expecting a PB
3. PB started to the nearest structural point (HL) of HTF = mitigating HTF OB
4. in LTF we have LL LH (bearish trend) 
5. this is inducement to continuation in LTF
6. this means HTF PB completed and HTF PT started.

[03:05:00]
💚 in up-trend: (**IDM1** => buy below HL) (**IDM2** => buy below LL)
💚 in down-trend: (**IDM1** => sell above LH) (**IDM2** => sell above HH)

[03:05:00]
💚 MM inject **hope\greed** to induce **trend-line traders** 
💚 MM inject **FOMO** to induce **SMC traders** 

[03:07:00]
🟡 this is the question: Buying at\below structural point

💚 specifically this reaction happens after reacting from a **false-OB** (SMT)

[03:07:00]
IDM2 inducing traders to stuck in internal-time-frame to a main leg & trapped to the wrong direction.
that's why so important to always zoom-out to make sure where the actual bias is.

🔥 IDM1 = External Gas Station
🔥 IDM2 = Internal Gas Station = get gas internally to attack external range

[03:24:00]
🔥 By understanding IDM it leads us to create a **pathway**.
🔥 By understanding IDM it telling you where LQD is.
🔥 after identifying where is the LQD, then the **pathway** is obvious.
🔥 in order to go lower we have to collect gas from higher (we have to induce higher to go lower) 💚

💚🔴🟡 You have to understand structure to understand inducement 🟡🔴💚
because if you mark out the wrong **structural points** you are **not** going to understand the right **inducement points**
