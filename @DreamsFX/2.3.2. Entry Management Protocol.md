**Entry Management Protocol**

💚 [00:22:40] Retail Traders Strategies (specially smart money trader) = using 10-15 SL

🟢 **Perceived Risk = Low**
🟠 **Perceived Risk = Medium**

🟢 1. LTF Refined Limit Order 
🟢 2. BOS Entry 
🟢 3. Continuation Entry 
🟢 4. Order Flow (With BOS)
🟠 5. Order Flow (No BOS)
******************************************************************************

******************************************************************************
🟢 1. LTF Refined Limit Order 

💚 [00:37:20] Between D and E, Why we choose E !? 
1. Because it follows the Order Flow .
2. Order Flow means efficient price delivery and makes the Extreme OB a HP OB.
3. we have internal sell of structure and E located inside that structure.
4. Key reason that D is not a HP OB: because it is located at Support & Resistance.
5. D located at Key Level and it means that it is most likely not gonna work out.

⚠️ Trade Outcome

******************************************************************************
🟢 2. BOS Entry 

💚 [00:39:05] Key difference between BOS and IDM:
1. BOS is the new structural trend 
2. that forms after reacting from a **True OB**
3. to cause price to continue HTF

⚠️ Rules & When to Apply 

⚠️ Trade Management

⚠️ Trade Outcome
******************************************************************************

******************************************************************************
🟢 3. Continuation Entry 
1. if you miss the main move
2. if you want to add extra positions
3. the identify the continuation entry
   
⚠️ Rules & When to Apply 
after the main mitigation ask yourself:
- the 1st option for Continuation Entry is:
    1. if price have the **EPA (WALL)** to the left THEN look for **1 min PB** to take off
- the 2nd option for Continuation Entry is:
    2. if price have the **SMT** to the left THEN look for **1 min PB** to take off
******************************************************************************

******************************************************************************
🟢 4. Order Flow (With BOS)
1. after mitigating HTF OB
2. identify consecutive EXT mitigated 
3. **making** new internal structure

1. IDM
2. TRAP
3. ORDER FLOW
******************************************************************************

******************************************************************************
🟠 5. Order Flow (No BOS)
1. after mitigating HTF OB
2. identify consecutive EXT mitigated 
3. **failing** new internal structure

💚 [00:57:55] OF dose not need to make BOS to be VALID

💚 [00:58:50] WHY all this is happening!? institutions accumulating their positions are fractal level to cause a huge impulsive move.

💚 [00:59:48] Who Detect OF !?  1. if no IMB then OF is intact  2. if IMB wait for mitigation

💚 [01:01:48] Train your eyes to see **wicks taking out wicks**
