1. Identify Main Trend Structure
2. Identify Internal Trend Structure
3. Where are Main IDMs (Destinations)
4. Where are Internal IDMs (Destinations)
5. Identify ENG LQD 
6. Identify SMT
7. Identify Pro Trend DEC & EXT
8. Create the HTF projection from where price currently is



ðŸ’š [00:16:00]
ENG LQD = LQD Point within range that price randomly picks up after IMB

ðŸ’š [00:17:13]
Why we call it ENG LQD !?
1. after major IMB
2. price fails to mitigate that IMB
3. price did not mitigate anything to the left
4. price runs away

SMT !?
1. OB that appeared to be structurally supported  
2. but they are actually not
   
Example:
1. HTF is bearish
2. LTF is bearish
3. in internal structure we have LH and LL 
4. many traders looking to, **the OB inside the range** to sell there because we are bearish
5. in fact, we are bearish, but because we are targeting the HTF destination, we need **gas** to get there
6. and the gas is above the internal structure LH
7. so, any OBs that lies within the **internal range** are **SMT**
8. because we have to go internal structure LH before going lower
9. even on LTF, traders **believe** that, we are structurally supported for sells, but we are not.
10. we have to go Higher to induce Higher before going Lower
11. any OB within internal rang causes internal PB
12. when SMT is mitigated price goes back to **Order Flow**
13. different IDM types **validate** the OB


ðŸ’š [00:36:19]
two things needed before going anywhere:
1. enough gas collected 
2. a strong enough OB that cause price to reverse.
(you cant have one without the other)
