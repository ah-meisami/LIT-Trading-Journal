1. Identify Main Trend Structure
2. Identify Internal Trend Structure
3. Where are Main IDMs (Destinations)
4. Where are Internal IDMs (Destinations)
5. Identify ENG LQD 
6. Identify SMT
7. Identify Pro Trend DEC & EXT
8. Create the HTF projection from where price currently is



游눜 [00:16:00]
ENG LQD = LQD Point within range that price randomly picks up after IMB

游눜 [00:17:13]
Why we call it ENG LQD !?
1. after major IMB
2. price fails to mitigate that IMB
3. price did not mitigate anything to the left
4. price runs away

游눜 [00:17:13]
SMT !?
1. OB that appeared to be structurally supported  
2. but they are actually not
   
Example:
1. HTF is bearish
2. LTF is bearish
3. in internal structure we have LH and LL 
4. many traders looking to, **the OB inside the range** to sell there because we are bearish
5. in fact, we are bearish, but because we are targeting the HTF destination, we need **gas** to get there
6. and the gas is above the internal structure LH
7. so, any OBs that lies within the **internal range** are **SMT**
8. because we have to go internal structure LH before going lower
9. even on LTF, traders **believe** that, we are structurally supported for sells, but we are not.
10. we have to go Higher to induce Higher before going Lower
11. any OB within internal rang causes internal PB
12. when SMT is mitigated price goes back to **Order Flow**
13. different IDM types **validate** the OB


游눜 [00:36:19]
two things needed before going anywhere:
1. enough gas collected 
2. a strong enough OB that cause price to reverse.
(you cant have one without the other)

ENGLQD Point:
1. it forms after IMB 
2. it dose not mitigate anything
3. it starts to mitigate itself
4. it forms a WALL

游눜 [02:17:40] ALGO CYCLE

1. Where are you in the whole cycle !?
2. Where is price targeting based on where you are !?
3. How will price get there !?


1. Where price currently is !?
1. What is the HTF Main Trend !? (**4h, D, W**) (what is the main leg)
2. What is the situation of mitigation of each swing point on the left (**DEC EXT SMT**) !?
3. What is the situation of order flow (**intact or not**) !? 
4. What is the situation ot trap of recent IDM (**major or medium**) !?
5. What is the HTF wave based on LTF structure (**4 Phases of HTF wave**) !?

**4 Phases of HTF wave**:
1. [Accumulation] You are at: end of the previous trend
2. [ReAccumulation] You are at: starting a new internal trend
3. [Distribution] You are at: high of the internal trend
4. [ReDistribution] You are at: continuing internal trend to target the HTF 

5. What is Price Targeting !?
6. Targeting current Main Structure
7. Targeting Int. IDM to mitigate
8. Targeting EXT or DEC
9. Targeting ENG LQD
10. Targeting HTF IDM after collecting gas from LTF IDM
11. Targeting LTF IDM after collecting gas from HTF IDM

3. How will price get there !? **Identify the gas station + OBs that will cause price to get to its destination**
1. Take out Int. IDM to target Ext. IDM
2. Take out Ext. IDM to target Int. IDM
3. React from SMT for pullback to mitigate pro-trend Order Flow
4. Mitigate EXT or DEC
5. Collecting gas from Ext. IDM to target Int. IDM
