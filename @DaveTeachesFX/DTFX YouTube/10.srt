10
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,279

00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,820
volume down a little bit why do not play

22
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,299
when it comes to laziness and and not

23
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:33,740
taking yourself seriously

24
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,479

33
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,020
of his house

00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:21,800
y'all see this

35
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,540
anybody that comes to this man's house

36
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:39,540
connection going on all right I turned

37
00:02:39,540 --> 00:02:41,819
the music off so that should be

38
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:45,200
that should help it y'all see this

39
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:51,420
this is the aerial shot

40
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,940
of his home

41
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,800
that means that anybody coming to his

42
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,700
home

43
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:58,739
they have to have some sort of business

44
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:01,080
there

45
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,590
in order to even walk by it

46
00:03:03,590 --> 00:03:07,019
[Laughter]

47
00:03:07,019 --> 00:03:10,459
don't even walk by it

48
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,860
y'all know where where

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,680
y'all know where Loki lived prior to

50
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,840
this

51
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,560
the hood

52
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:26,940
poor neighborhood with gang violence

53
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,159
drug infested

54
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:31,980
having to look over his shoulder

55
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:36,200
wherever it is that that he's going

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:39,540
and Loki wrote to me guys I want you

57
00:03:39,540 --> 00:03:41,940
guys to know that that this is not

58
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,159
something that took

59
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,099
years to happen

60
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:50,159
this is not something that took years to

61
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,200
happen yes he lived in the ghetto this

62
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,900
is not something that took years to

63
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:57,080
happen

64
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:00,480
Loki wrote to me in March he was in my

65
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,340
group

66
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:07,080
he only had his his uh uh funded account

67
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:09,180
and guess how much money he had in his

68
00:04:09,180 --> 00:04:10,400
bank account

69
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,560
zero dollars

70
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:17,160
V zero dollars

71
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:20,040
and he said this has to work for me

72
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:23,580
it's my last shot all I have is one

73
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,040
funded account when I was telling him to

74
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,780
get a trade copy and a trade copy of

75
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,240
course 150 he was like I don't have the

76
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,000
funds right now it's just this only

77
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,560
account

78
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:36,600
that I have

79
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:39,540
and I have nothing else in my bank

80
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,940
account that's what he said nothing else

81
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:43,560
in my bank account

82
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:46,560
so he said I'm depending on being able

83
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,860
to get a payout from this account it's

84
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,919
my last shot

85
00:04:52,919 --> 00:04:56,220
that's what you said so this is my last

86
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:58,759
shot

87
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,940
so that man was banking this is what

88
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:07,800
some of the Twitter Traders they they

89
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,960
love to speak against this oh if you

90
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:11,520
trade him for money then you need to go

91
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:13,680
and fix your situation

92
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,780
then you then you need to go and and

93
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,180
deal with that do you need to go and get

94
00:05:18,180 --> 00:05:22,400
a job Loki said he couldn't get a job

95
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,580
his record he had he he couldn't get a

96
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:28,759
job

97
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:31,020
no skills to really do anything to bring

98
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,820
in income and guess what still had a

99
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,100
family that he had to provide for

100
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:37,919
ain't that crazy still had a family that

101
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:40,320
he had to provide for

102
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,780
so what was needed

103
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:45,060
discipline

104
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:48,380
and the right information

105
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:51,740
discipline

106
00:05:52,199 --> 00:05:55,199
and the right information so I told them

107
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,320
I said listen Loki

108
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:02,180
I said every time I look at your chart

109
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,680
you got stuff on there that I do not

110
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:07,020
teach you

111
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:09,120
good stuff on your chart

112
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,419
that I do not have in the course that

113
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:14,580
that I've taught

114
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:17,160
so get rid of those Bollinger Bands on

115
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,240
your chart

116
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:19,740
he came and asked me about some

117
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:21,720
indicators some Lux I'll go indicator

118
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,639
tell me what you think about this this

119
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:25,319
was still during that time where he was

120
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:26,639
struggling and didn't want to lose their

121
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,900
single account because he was counting

122
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,100
on the payout to come out of that

123
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:31,220
account

124
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:34,319
I said do not talk to me about no Lux

125
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,960
I'll go indicator you all you need is

126
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:38,580
what's in the playlist

127
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:41,400
I want to hear any of that don't no

128
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,500
indicator nothing you need to be able to

129
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:46,580
see this for yourself

130
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:49,020
so he came to me one last time this is

131
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,699
his last shot let me actually read let

132
00:06:50,699 --> 00:06:53,840
me let me read the text message

133
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,479
we really checked the the message that

134
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:00,020
he sent to me

135
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,840
look at this this is this is March 12th

136
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:24,240
remember we're in June right now we're

137
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,759
at the end of June

138
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:28,740
we're the end of June let me let me let

139
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:31,020
me put his put his uh uh

140
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,759
put his house back up on the screen

141
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,000
so y'all here with somebody living in

142
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,460
that house right now

143
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,099
was saying just a few months back

144
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:49,440
because he wasn't living in this this

145
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,340
this location

146
00:07:56,699 --> 00:08:00,380
put it back up on the screen for y'all

147
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:04,380
show y'all why I don't

148
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:06,300
play

149
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,639
when it comes to to taking yourself

150
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,440
seriously

151
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:12,120
when it comes to putting in the time

152
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:13,860
putting in the effort

153
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:15,780
this is house remember there's this

154
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:17,220
house right there

155
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:20,819
this is in March March 12th so this is

156
00:08:20,819 --> 00:08:24,319
not even just a few months ago

157
00:08:28,979 --> 00:08:31,560
he said actually look his his February

158
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:33,719
here's February

159
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,719
he wrote To Me February 17th and he said

160
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:39,059
hey thank you for everything

161
00:08:39,059 --> 00:08:42,120
I keep making the same mistake of

162
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:44,279
getting in at the wrong time and ending

163
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:45,779
up in drawdown

164
00:08:45,779 --> 00:08:48,480
now this doesn't happen every day but it

165
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,640
happens more on days like today I'm

166
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:52,920
spending all of Sunday studying the

167
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:53,880
videos

168
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,399
and really wanted your recommendation on

169
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,240
which videos or live streams you think

170
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:02,839
will help

171
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,640
so

172
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,180
I told him when it comes to risk

173
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,560
management

174
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,360
first of all here's what I actually

175
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,040
wrote let me know even show code here's

176
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:15,839
what I actually wrote I said hey brother

177
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,000
what's up so I've been digging through

178
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:19,920
some videos for the last hour or so

179
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,440
video five is the one that deals with

180
00:09:22,440 --> 00:09:25,560
entries Trail your highs and lows hit it

181
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:28,200
in every single video is half of the

182
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:31,140
work already knocked out

183
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:33,899
I'm not giving him any new information

184
00:09:33,899 --> 00:09:36,000
you don't need to know you know any

185
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,240
anything else trailing your highs and

186
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:44,279
lows is half of the work already knocked

187
00:09:44,279 --> 00:09:45,959
out

188
00:09:45,959 --> 00:09:49,019
I said an execution plan is what's

189
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:55,200
needed and I wrote in caps per trade

190
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,860
I said use the entry methods on video

191
00:09:58,860 --> 00:10:02,339
five while back testing and forward

192
00:10:02,339 --> 00:10:06,060
testing Don't Force the entries that you

193
00:10:06,060 --> 00:10:09,000
want take the entries that you see

194
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,399
that's what I told them not the entries

195
00:10:11,399 --> 00:10:12,839
that you want

196
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,060
take the entries that you see

197
00:10:17,580 --> 00:10:22,019
I said that should be good to start with

198
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:24,720
sometimes it's just a reset

199
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,880
that we need this is what I said then

200
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,580
he said thank you brother there's just

201
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:32,279
so much material to go over

202
00:10:32,279 --> 00:10:36,120
and I've watched them several times

203
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,600
but I guess my memory sucks

204
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,360
this is in in February

205
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:44,459
so I got on a live stream with them in

206
00:10:44,459 --> 00:10:46,079
the group

207
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:48,300
and I talked to them

208
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,700
about this specific thing and he knows

209
00:10:50,700 --> 00:10:52,920
that I was talking to him in particular

210
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:54,480
because he knows the last message he

211
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:56,100
sent to me I didn't respond back to that

212
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:57,660
message

213
00:10:57,660 --> 00:11:00,420
I I got in actually I have I have a

214
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:03,200
recording of it

215
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,620
according to me I recorded it I said

216
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:10,680
your memory is not the problem

217
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,160
it's what it's competing for

218
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,380
so the more that you know

219
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:19,500
the stat line of your favorite team

220
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,720
what Joey B is doing and what he's

221
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:22,980
saying

222
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:25,560
what Trump is is doing

223
00:11:25,560 --> 00:11:28,140
what are all these other people that you

224
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:32,339
Keeping Up with the Kardashians

225
00:11:32,399 --> 00:11:34,740
Keeping Up with the Kardashians and and

226
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:38,360
not with what you need to pay attention

227
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,779
don't hear that

228
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,560
he said

229
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:46,200
his memory sucks no your memory doesn't

230
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,399
suck

231
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:51,600
your ability to follow instructions suck

232
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,839
that's what it is

233
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:56,220
I said

234
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:59,579
take 30 days and and this is this is

235
00:11:59,579 --> 00:12:01,860
what this is the same thing that I told

236
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:03,600
them inside of the group after this

237
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,720
message I said take 30 days

238
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:12,540
to only consume this to only consume the

239
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:16,800
playlist take 30 days nothing else

240
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:19,680
forget about any award shows that's

241
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,560
going on forget about you know any games

242
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,839
that's being played he told me he was an

243
00:12:24,839 --> 00:12:29,000
avid follower of sports games

244
00:12:29,339 --> 00:12:31,320
and then he started to tell me that he

245
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:33,180
no longer knows what's really happening

246
00:12:33,180 --> 00:12:34,980
in them he doesn't really follow them

247
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:36,540
sometimes when friends come over they

248
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:38,459
talk to him about it I started to see

249
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:40,980
the evolution of it

250
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:43,980
so I told him I said your memory is

251
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:46,139
competing

252
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:47,820
for all these different things that

253
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:50,820
you're taking in more

254
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:53,639
than this

255
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,100
more than than the actual learning

256
00:12:59,399 --> 00:13:01,800
it's competing for that

257
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:06,480
yo you will have time to keep up with

258
00:13:06,480 --> 00:13:08,519
celebrities later on if that's your

259
00:13:08,519 --> 00:13:10,980
interest you have time to keep up with

260
00:13:10,980 --> 00:13:13,139
real housewives of whatever it is for

261
00:13:13,139 --> 00:13:14,639
the ladies that's him for the men who's

262
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,639
forced to watch it you will have time

263
00:13:17,639 --> 00:13:20,100
to keep up with those things you have

264
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:22,680
time to go back to Netflix and and watch

265
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,440
Bridgeton and all that you will have

266
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:27,420
time later on you know how many shows

267
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:29,459
that's on the backlog for me that I that

268
00:13:29,459 --> 00:13:31,320
I still haven't finished

269
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:34,560
you won't have time for those things

270
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,740
trust and believe you will have time for

271
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,920
it

272
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:47,060
right now is not the time

273
00:13:48,360 --> 00:13:51,060
you will have time

274
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:54,440
for those things

275
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,579
you want to listen to what Joe Rogan has

276
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:58,079
to say about whatever it is you want to

277
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:00,240
watch the Eagles versus Mark Zuckerberg

278
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:02,220
fight you want to keep up with the

279
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:05,040
events leading up to the next

280
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,680
go ahead keep up with it

281
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:10,260
and be poor

282
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:13,200
or get rid of it and change your life

283
00:14:13,200 --> 00:14:15,600
change your mind listen they say it

284
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,260
takes 21 days

285
00:14:18,260 --> 00:14:21,720
21 days

286
00:14:21,720 --> 00:14:23,940
to make something a habit

287
00:14:23,940 --> 00:14:27,560
21 days

288
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,760
and if you could make it a habit you can

289
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:31,620
make it a lifestyle right

290
00:14:31,620 --> 00:14:34,500
21 days so guess what that means there's

291
00:14:34,500 --> 00:14:36,180
20 trading days

292
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,339
and then

293
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:40,980
one day goes into the next month

294
00:14:40,980 --> 00:14:44,519
so when the market is open you're tape

295
00:14:44,519 --> 00:14:47,639
reading when the market is closed you're

296
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:48,959
studying

297
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:51,959
when it opens back up your tape reading

298
00:14:51,959 --> 00:14:56,339
when it closes you're studying

299
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:00,360
and you're doing that over and over and

300
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:05,399
over and over and over and over and over

301
00:15:05,399 --> 00:15:10,100
and all I'm saying is one month for God

302
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,369
[Music]

303
00:15:13,800 --> 00:15:15,779
you can't stop watching your favorite TV

304
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:18,540
show for one month in order to change

305
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:21,800
your life forever

306
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:24,480
one month

307
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,019
one

308
00:15:27,019 --> 00:15:30,180
they asking for arm and a leg I'd like

309
00:15:30,180 --> 00:15:32,459
to ask you to join my group

310
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:34,980
nobody asks you to pay anything but

311
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:37,980
attention

312
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:42,360
one month that's what I told them in the

313
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:44,279
group I said

314
00:15:44,279 --> 00:15:48,420
one month just devote one month to this

315
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:51,360
you will begin to see some changes in a

316
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:52,440
week though

317
00:15:52,440 --> 00:15:54,839
y'all heard Denise when she came on and

318
00:15:54,839 --> 00:15:58,620
said you'll see changes in a week

319
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:02,880
but one month is what I'm asking you for

320
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:06,420
guess what I learned all of this that

321
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,519
I'm teaching I learned it in four months

322
00:16:08,519 --> 00:16:10,560
it took me one month to start pulling

323
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,600
money out of the market but I learned

324
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:15,860
all of this in four

325
00:16:16,380 --> 00:16:20,339
and I was able to take what I learned in

326
00:16:20,339 --> 00:16:22,440
those four months

327
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,860
and chew it up

328
00:16:25,860 --> 00:16:29,779
and give you it in a concise manner

329
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:33,660
that's that's what 20 20 hours 23 hours

330
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:36,420
of course work that's 23 hours in the

331
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,320
playlist

332
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:38,880
I don't even really know how much hours

333
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:41,699
it is I don't know 23 24 hours something

334
00:16:41,699 --> 00:16:43,800
like that that just added a new video to

335
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:46,440
it so let's say 24 hours I was able to

336
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:49,560
take what I learned over four months and

337
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,100
deliver it in 24 hours of speaking

338
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:58,639
24 hours

339
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,880
and I said take that 24 hours of

340
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:05,640
coursework and let it be the only thing

341
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,000
you watch every single day

342
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:12,559
let it be the only thing that you watch

343
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:17,160
every day you'll get tired of my voice

344
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:19,559
you're going to be startled by me

345
00:17:19,559 --> 00:17:22,760
yelling at my kids

346
00:17:24,299 --> 00:17:26,760
I'm telling you I'm laughing but but

347
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:28,860
it's required

348
00:17:28,860 --> 00:17:33,179
this is the sacrifice that's required

349
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:36,620
this is required

350
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,520
I said one month every day I get it it's

351
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,660
dry it's long oh my gosh it's so much to

352
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,080
write down then after I write it down I

353
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,120
have to go and look at the charts and

354
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:54,360
then try to interpret it

355
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:57,720
try to interpret it

356
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,240
after writing it all down and sometimes

357
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:02,880
when I try to interpret it guess what

358
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,820
I'm trying to interpret it

359
00:18:05,820 --> 00:18:08,280
I may stumble I may think it's bad and

360
00:18:08,280 --> 00:18:10,500
it's something else

361
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:14,760
I may be defeated on some days

362
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,440
but you gotta keep going

363
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:23,039
you gotta keep going

364
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:25,559
because soon enough it's gonna break you

365
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:28,080
gotta keep going so I wrote that I wrote

366
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:29,280
that to him

367
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:33,179
on the 18th then he wrote back to me the

368
00:18:33,179 --> 00:18:35,039
following month on the 12th so this is

369
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,520
almost almost 30 days after I sent that

370
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:42,419
rebuke to the group almost 30 days

371
00:18:42,419 --> 00:18:45,539
and he said good afternoon Dave I don't

372
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:48,600
understand what's happening with me I've

373
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:52,620
put in many hours of studying every day

374
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:54,539
first he told me he was setting aside

375
00:18:54,539 --> 00:18:56,880
Sunday to watch to watch his videos okay

376
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:58,320
yeah I know where you at brother you

377
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,000
setting aside Sunday to watch it okay

378
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,340
yeah cause you just you just watching

379
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:03,900
for a couple of hours a week and then

380
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,520
and then you go and think that you're

381
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:07,740
Superman because you won one entry and

382
00:19:07,740 --> 00:19:09,240
then the rest of it you start to fall

383
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:11,039
apart

384
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,620
because you think a couple of hours a

385
00:19:13,620 --> 00:19:16,380
couple of hours in in one day out of out

386
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:18,179
of the two weeks

387
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:21,600
that you said you was going to set aside

388
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:23,460
you watch the video for a couple hours

389
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,620
you wouldn't want to trade you like oh

390
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:27,660
yeah the videos work

391
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:29,640
and then you started to fall apart after

392
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:32,580
that the consistency started to mess up

393
00:19:32,580 --> 00:19:34,559
you might even feel good about having a

394
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,720
winning day and then the rest of the day

395
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,580
start to feel brutal

396
00:19:40,580 --> 00:19:46,400
brutal oh my gosh I know how that feels

397
00:19:46,620 --> 00:19:49,919
you did great on one day you conquered

398
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:51,720
it you said yo I could I could do this

399
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:54,059
for the rest of my life

400
00:19:54,059 --> 00:19:59,220
I could do this for the rest of my life

401
00:19:59,220 --> 00:20:00,780
goodness

402
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:03,240
I'ma be rich

403
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,740
that's what you said after that one

404
00:20:04,740 --> 00:20:06,419
winning day

405
00:20:06,419 --> 00:20:08,039
and the next day you came in and you

406
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:11,000
barely made it out alive

407
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:13,860
started thinking twice about it then the

408
00:20:13,860 --> 00:20:16,320
following day you came in and you got

409
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:18,480
that bomb entry oh that was good and

410
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,880
guess what after that you started to

411
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:22,740
fall apart all the way through start to

412
00:20:22,740 --> 00:20:25,260
give you gains right back

413
00:20:25,260 --> 00:20:27,179
even if it was demo start to give you

414
00:20:27,179 --> 00:20:29,960
games right back

415
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:32,760
and guess what the first day you watched

416
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,100
the video and you did that

417
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:37,140
and then the second day

418
00:20:37,140 --> 00:20:39,000
you went back to a little more of it and

419
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:40,380
then you were like all right you know I

420
00:20:40,380 --> 00:20:42,179
think I'm good now

421
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:43,980
third fourth fifth day guess what you

422
00:20:43,980 --> 00:20:46,500
stopped doing watching them videos

423
00:20:46,500 --> 00:20:49,620
guess what you stopped doing studying

424
00:20:49,620 --> 00:20:51,360
guess what you stopped doing being

425
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,580
diligent and consistent with what you

426
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,400
were told to do which was watch it every

427
00:20:56,400 --> 00:21:00,120
day which was set aside time all of it

428
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:02,820

00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:05,520

432
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,620

00:21:10,620 --> 00:21:13,080

484
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:18,780
cause clearly you are not taking your

485
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:21,900
time seriously you clearly not taking

486
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,780
your time seriously

487
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:26,880
you got enough energy in you to go out

488
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:30,419
and rev your engines illegally because

489
00:23:30,419 --> 00:23:33,299
because bike biking is is that's illegal

490
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:35,419
in

491
00:23:35,419 --> 00:23:38,220

New York that's illegal out there but

494
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,240
you're going out to do that all right

495
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:48,419
because that's the desire of your heart

496
00:23:48,419 --> 00:23:50,400
to to be around people and seek

497
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:53,280
validation and all that other stuff

498
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:55,320
that's a desire your heart

499
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:56,700
and I wasn't talking to him in

500
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:58,980
particular I was talking to the whole

501
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:02,159
group when he told me about this

502
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:04,500
I'ma throw shots but not directly at you

503
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,120
but I promise you you're gonna feel it

504
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,260
because I don't miss

505
00:24:10,799 --> 00:24:12,659
I don't I don't miss

506
00:24:12,659 --> 00:24:16,440
yeah no I don't I don't

507
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,520
y'all see that bad boy

508
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:24,200
now who who said who who who told y'all

509
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,299
[Music]

510
00:24:28,740 --> 00:24:31,220
so

511
00:24:32,580 --> 00:24:35,240
he said

512
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:39,240
I've put in many hours of studying every

513
00:24:39,240 --> 00:24:40,980
day

514
00:24:40,980 --> 00:24:43,799
I'm watching and taking notes

515
00:24:43,799 --> 00:24:46,919
and I'm still struggling to be what

516
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:49,919
consistent

517
00:24:50,700 --> 00:24:55,220
still struggling to be consistent

518
00:24:55,559 --> 00:24:58,980
now some days I would see him

519
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,020
in the group

520
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:02,940
you know showing up to the live streams

521
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:06,480
but I did not see him posting any charts

522
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:08,520
laughing and talking with everybody but

523
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,620
not posting any charts

524
00:25:10,620 --> 00:25:13,140
what did I tell them I said post charts

525
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:14,820
because it's the only way I'm gonna know

526
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:17,220
where you are and your level of learning

527
00:25:17,220 --> 00:25:20,580
and what to direct you to go back to

528
00:25:20,580 --> 00:25:25,620
what video to tell you to go and watch

529
00:25:25,620 --> 00:25:31,200
so you need to post it's very important

530
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:32,940
don't come in and ask me what my account

531
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:35,520
size is don't come in asking me you know

532
00:25:35,520 --> 00:25:37,380
where I'm planning to what I think the

533
00:25:37,380 --> 00:25:39,480
market is doing today

534
00:25:39,480 --> 00:25:41,640
where I'm planning to get in oh is this

535
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,700
buys right here don't even think about

536
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,900
it

537
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:47,220
because you're not taking yourself

538
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,080
seriously if you come along with that

539
00:25:51,179 --> 00:25:52,980
so

540
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:56,100
he said for me this is this is March

541
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,059
12th

542
00:25:57,059 --> 00:26:01,500
for me this has to work as I don't have

543
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,400
any more options to bring in income we

544
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:09,559
are on the verge of losing everything

545
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:14,360
and I don't know what to do

546
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:16,200
y'all hear that

547
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:19,460

00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:22,140
let me read that again for for those in

549
00:26:22,140 --> 00:26:26,159
the back I think they got time

550
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:31,140
for me this has to work

551
00:26:31,140 --> 00:26:36,720
as I don't have any more options to

552
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,539
bring in income

553
00:26:38,539 --> 00:26:44,520
we are on the verge of losing

554
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:47,360
everything

555
00:26:48,059 --> 00:26:49,620
and you know you know what he you know

556
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:51,960
what he said to me

557
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:54,980
you know what he said to me

558
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:59,659
he said I don't know what to do

559
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,100
that statement there

560
00:27:05,159 --> 00:27:08,480
had to be the most

561
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,559
asinine an erroneous statement

562
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:16,020
I could ever hear from somebody that I

563
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:18,320
was giving

564
00:27:18,679 --> 00:27:23,220
every day of my life to

565
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,220
telling them what they needed to do

566
00:27:26,220 --> 00:27:29,520
doesn't know what to do

567
00:27:29,520 --> 00:27:32,279
he said I'm studying video one today and

568
00:27:32,279 --> 00:27:34,740
this is probably the 15th time I've

569
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,020
watched it

570
00:27:37,020 --> 00:27:39,480
I said what are you struggling with

571
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,900
he said it's still my entries I said

572
00:27:42,900 --> 00:27:44,760
show me a chart

573
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:49,039
of a failed entry for you

574
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:53,640
so he went to show me the he sent me the

575
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:54,539
chart

576
00:27:54,539 --> 00:27:57,600
he sent me to his the the chart of his

577
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:00,320
failed entries

578
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:03,600
he sent me a chart of his fail entries

579
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:06,179
and guess what was on there

580
00:28:06,179 --> 00:28:09,380
guess what was on that chart

581
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:13,679
Bollinger Bands

582
00:28:13,679 --> 00:28:17,659
support and resistance lines

583
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:25,140
and when he sent it to me

584
00:28:25,140 --> 00:28:27,539
guess what I responded with y'all

585
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:30,740
guess what I said to him

586
00:28:35,039 --> 00:28:38,120
guess what I said then

587
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:41,100
I said nothing

588
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:43,700
at all

589
00:28:43,740 --> 00:28:46,640
nothing

590
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,900
to nothing not one word to him

591
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:54,240
oh you're about to lose everything

00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,480

nothing

643
00:31:24,659 --> 00:31:27,659
other than the same information

644
00:31:27,659 --> 00:31:30,840
that they were refusing to what was the

645
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,620
strategy y'all

646
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:36,799

647
00:31:37,559 --> 00:31:40,279

playlist I've given so many different

654
00:31:57,539 --> 00:31:59,159
ways to enter

655
00:31:59,159 --> 00:32:01,980
I've given so many different rules that

656
00:32:01,980 --> 00:32:04,559
your entry should abide by if you're an

657
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,320
impulsive type of person

658
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:09,600
or if you're a calculative type of

659
00:32:09,600 --> 00:32:10,440
person

660
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:13,500
if you have anxiety ways to manage

661
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:16,080
so many different ways to end it and

662
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:19,140
what did I do I went back did a little

663
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:21,240
video with them and guess what it's the

664
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,320
same thing

665
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,020

00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:27,779
low you tap back in and it'll be short

667
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:29,520
but one thing you want to make sure

668
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:32,100
you're looking at is

669
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:35,640
the higher time frame as well you're

670
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:37,919
working in conjunction with the higher

671
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:39,299
time frame

672
00:32:39,299 --> 00:32:43,380
and you're trailing your lows right

673
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:47,360
as you do you trailing your lows

674
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:49,860
and this is the way you manage and you

675
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:51,600
can do this each and every day whether

676
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:52,740
it's from the top side whether it's from

677
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,240
the bottom side no matter what pay it's

678
00:32:54,240 --> 00:32:55,559

because I don't have anything to say

689
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:23,820
because I already said all of it and I

690
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:27,360
was disappointed as as a teacher

691
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:30,000
to know that that

692
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:32,899

coming here

698
00:33:47,460 --> 00:33:48,980
this ain't

699
00:33:48,980 --> 00:33:52,019
we're coming to the whole hands and

700
00:33:52,019 --> 00:33:55,220

general

704
00:34:03,059 --> 00:34:05,580
we we find ways to comfort ourselves

705
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,919
being broke we find ways to comfort

706
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:10,320
ourselves while under stress and we're

707
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:12,780
doing the opposite

708
00:34:12,780 --> 00:34:17,060
of the things that we should be doing

709
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:22,320
always find time to to be comfortable to

710
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:24,560
to do whatever it is that we want to do

711
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:27,540
we always find time to do it always find

712
00:34:27,540 --> 00:34:30,000
time to feed these habits

713
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:34,440
that are no good for us

714
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,260

and you think Something's Gonna Change

735
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,520
for you in a market that people have

736
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:40,380
been trying

737
00:35:40,380 --> 00:35:44,280
to figure out for years

I'm talking about decades people been in

739
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:48,960

00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:15,560
class

750
00:36:15,780 --> 00:36:19,920
he said I haven't slept in two days

751
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:23,040
finally slept and just getting up

752
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:25,200
and I said it's cool brother

753
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,119
I recorded it

754
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:30,920
because I know what that meant

755
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,079
it wasn't telling me yeah I'm busy doing

756
00:36:34,079 --> 00:36:35,640
so and so you know I'm gonna try to

757
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,920
catch it did you record it yet

758
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,359
were you were you ever drop the

759
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:43,619
recording no hasn't slept in two days

760
00:36:43,619 --> 00:36:45,720
what's what's On this man's mind that he

761
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:47,460
hasn't slept in two days this is a week

762
00:36:47,460 --> 00:36:49,800
after he wrote to me that he was on the

763
00:36:49,800 --> 00:36:51,960
verge of losing everything

764
00:36:51,960 --> 00:36:53,400
you telling me that he ain't sleeping

765
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,079
two days

766
00:36:55,079 --> 00:36:57,000
and I'm like okay I know where that's at

767
00:36:57,000 --> 00:37:00,839
because I know what kept me up at night

768
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:04,020
I know I know the the eviction son or my

769
00:37:04,020 --> 00:37:05,940
dog kept me up

770
00:37:05,940 --> 00:37:08,280
I know missing meals so my kids could

771
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:11,220
eat and and we have a little more

772
00:37:11,220 --> 00:37:13,560
to eat

773
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:18,420
until we finally run out I I know that

774
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:22,740
kept me up for days

775
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,839
I get a tiny little bit of sleep and

776
00:37:24,839 --> 00:37:27,839
then wake back up again

777
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:32,119
only could sleep two three hours

778
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:36,320
I know that kept me up

779
00:37:36,359 --> 00:37:38,280
and

780
00:37:38,280 --> 00:37:40,200
that's what was going on with him so I

781
00:37:40,200 --> 00:37:43,339
began to see the evolution

782
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:49,940
began to see the evolution

783
00:37:52,740 --> 00:37:55,140
proud of that he he

784
00:37:55,140 --> 00:37:57,420
sent me a

785
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,820
a

786
00:37:58,820 --> 00:38:01,560
thing he said he said have you checked

787
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:03,300
out the indicator for smart money

788
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,200
concepts by luck Lux algo

789
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:10,560
so all I did was send him a tweet

790
00:38:10,560 --> 00:38:12,839
and my tweet said

791
00:38:12,839 --> 00:38:15,900
this is why I send everyone to learn SMC

792
00:38:15,900 --> 00:38:19,280
from ICT himself

793
00:38:19,320 --> 00:38:21,180
because there was somebody saying oh all

794
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,680
you got to do is get in anytime you see

795
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:24,180
the indicator do this all you got to do

796
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,440
is get it anytime you see the indicator

797
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,920
do that

798
00:38:28,260 --> 00:38:31,560
somebody you know said they were just

799
00:38:31,560 --> 00:38:34,020
they posted a video about it so I sent

800
00:38:34,020 --> 00:38:36,060
him that tweet

801
00:38:36,060 --> 00:38:38,579
that it's an absolute Griff coming from

802
00:38:38,579 --> 00:38:40,380
that company to say someone should do

803
00:38:40,380 --> 00:38:41,760
this they're going to end up being a

804
00:38:41,760 --> 00:38:43,079
liquidity

805
00:38:43,079 --> 00:38:44,640
they're gonna end up losing their money

806
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:48,000
with this no matter what indicator you

807
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:50,460
have out there

808
00:38:50,460 --> 00:38:52,800
it is not enough

809
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:55,079
that you should depend on

810
00:38:55,079 --> 00:38:57,780
something popping up

811
00:38:57,780 --> 00:39:01,140
and you going into to take a trip that's

812
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:04,560
called signals we don't do that here

813
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:07,400
Fair total

814
00:39:08,339 --> 00:39:10,619
and that was the last conversation that

815
00:39:10,619 --> 00:39:12,060
I had with him that entire conversation

816
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:14,579
last conversation I have

817
00:39:14,579 --> 00:39:18,599
and he would show up every single day to

818
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,720
the uh

819
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:24,480
we show up every single day to the the

820
00:39:24,480 --> 00:39:26,579
live streams that I was doing he started

821
00:39:26,579 --> 00:39:28,740
to post some of his charts inside of the

822
00:39:28,740 --> 00:39:30,780
thing he started to send me some of his

823
00:39:30,780 --> 00:39:32,700
charts individually some people a little

824
00:39:32,700 --> 00:39:34,440
insecure about posting it around the

825
00:39:34,440 --> 00:39:36,180
people so they end up sending it to me

826
00:39:36,180 --> 00:39:37,800
that's fine too

827
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:39,780
that's fine too if they privately send

828
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:42,119
it to me as well I'm fine with that as

829
00:39:42,119 --> 00:39:44,640
well because it's still getting the help

830
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:45,960
that they need but they're putting

831
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:48,859
themselves out there

832
00:39:50,700 --> 00:39:54,260
but if you if you look

833
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:58,560
that was March that he was telling me

834
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:00,960
that for those who count on your fingers

835
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:03,180
still

836
00:40:03,180 --> 00:40:05,960
April

837
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:09,140
May

838
00:40:10,980 --> 00:40:14,599
June he moved here

839
00:40:17,700 --> 00:40:21,119
it's on the verge of losing everything

840
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:24,500
two months prior

841
00:40:25,260 --> 00:40:27,960
to being able to

842
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,240
buy a house Bigger Than The Fresh Prince

843
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,099
of Bel-Air

844
00:40:32,099 --> 00:40:36,079
more land than the White House

845
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:41,900
two months

846
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:45,720
because what doing exactly

847
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:48,000
what he was told to do

848
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:50,460
following the instructions putting in a

849
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:53,460
time making it work for himself

850
00:40:53,460 --> 00:40:56,460
now

851
00:41:00,720 --> 00:41:04,700
changed his whole situation

852
00:41:05,579 --> 00:41:09,020
because of what obedience

853
00:41:09,240 --> 00:41:11,220
y'all don't have to like me here I don't

854
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:13,260
care if y'all don't like me I like me I

855
00:41:13,260 --> 00:41:15,180
don't care

856
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:19,800
but you'll have to take seriously

857
00:41:19,800 --> 00:41:22,079
what it is that's being taught here

858
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,980
because it's necessary

859
00:41:25,980 --> 00:41:29,099
it's necessary to have these things in

860
00:41:29,099 --> 00:41:31,740
your mind going over and over and over

861
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:34,740
and over and over and over and over does

862
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:37,320
random thoughts

863
00:41:37,320 --> 00:41:41,720
over and over again is plenty of mine

864
00:41:45,060 --> 00:41:47,579
what I used to think about when seeing

865
00:41:47,579 --> 00:41:51,440
empty car spaces imbalances

866
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:54,900
seeing seeing all these different

867
00:41:54,900 --> 00:41:57,480
you know things outside that had nothing

868
00:41:57,480 --> 00:42:00,060
to do with trading I would see it in

869
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,859
other things

870
00:42:01,859 --> 00:42:03,359
because that's the only thing that was

871
00:42:03,359 --> 00:42:04,800
in my mind running

872
00:42:04,800 --> 00:42:07,680
the only thing I'm up at night

873
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,619
thinking about the entry that I missed

874
00:42:10,619 --> 00:42:13,200
and how I could have

875
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:17,060
how I could have could have changed it

876
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,980
how I could have been involved in it or

877
00:42:19,980 --> 00:42:22,859
the entry that I lost and and what I

878
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:24,240
could have did to

879
00:42:24,240 --> 00:42:26,160
I'm up that's going through my mind the

880
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:27,300
whole time

881
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:30,119
the whole time how I over leverage when

882
00:42:30,119 --> 00:42:32,700
I should not have

883
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:35,760
how I escaped

884
00:42:35,760 --> 00:42:37,440
from an entry that I should have lost my

885
00:42:37,440 --> 00:42:38,700
account on

886
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:42,260
because of what I didn't follow my rules

887
00:42:43,859 --> 00:42:46,920
I don't care where Beyonce is

888
00:42:46,920 --> 00:42:50,960
what I care about is is

889
00:42:51,300 --> 00:42:54,000
why I'm not getting this I care about

890
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:57,000
that more than than what she's doing and

891
00:42:57,000 --> 00:42:59,880
what what new show is out there

892
00:42:59,880 --> 00:43:03,119
then who's playing what sports it was an

893
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:06,300
avid NBA follower I used to follow all

894
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,760
the games I used to watch all the games

895
00:43:08,760 --> 00:43:11,579
when things got tight for me I knew what

896
00:43:11,579 --> 00:43:14,520
I needed to do I knew I needed to let go

897
00:43:14,520 --> 00:43:16,079
of everything

898
00:43:16,079 --> 00:43:20,099
that fulfilled my momentary emotions but

899
00:43:20,099 --> 00:43:21,780
did nothing

900
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:24,359
for my circumstances

901
00:43:24,359 --> 00:43:26,819
nothing

902
00:43:26,819 --> 00:43:30,200
for my circumstances

903
00:43:30,240 --> 00:43:33,000
if the part of risk management too

904
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:36,540
many on our way in Risk in life

905
00:43:36,540 --> 00:43:39,720
y'all are not paying attention to

906
00:43:39,720 --> 00:43:41,940
the things that's that's necessary to

907
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,920
progress your friends are going to be

908
00:43:43,920 --> 00:43:47,339
there trust me the same friends that I

909
00:43:47,339 --> 00:43:48,720
lost

910
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,819
learning this

911
00:43:50,819 --> 00:43:52,560
I look back at where they are now and

912
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:54,060
they still in the same place

913
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,819
still having the same conversations

914
00:43:56,819 --> 00:43:58,380
still think about the same thing still

915
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,760
blaming people for the issues that

916
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:00,660
happened

917
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,000
the friends that I lost

918
00:44:03,000 --> 00:44:06,780
once I chose to pick up

919
00:44:06,780 --> 00:44:10,020
and and do what I needed to do for my

920
00:44:10,020 --> 00:44:10,920
future

921
00:44:10,920 --> 00:44:13,200
I started to progress

922
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:16,940
I had to leave a lot of people

923
00:44:18,119 --> 00:44:22,500
had to leave a lot of people behind

924
00:44:22,500 --> 00:44:25,140
I realized that people weren't really my

925
00:44:25,140 --> 00:44:26,300
friends

926
00:44:26,300 --> 00:44:28,440
that's the thing about profitability

927
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,020
that a lot of people don't talk about

928
00:44:31,020 --> 00:44:34,140
once you finally get this and you put in

929
00:44:34,140 --> 00:44:36,359
the hours that's necessary to get this

930
00:44:36,359 --> 00:44:39,720
and you cut off the whole world to do

931
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:42,000
what you need to do

932
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:43,920
you're going to have more people that's

933
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,140
against you than for you and you got to

934
00:44:46,140 --> 00:44:48,900
be willing to lose

935
00:44:48,900 --> 00:44:51,240
not just in your entries

936
00:44:51,240 --> 00:44:54,359
You're Gonna Lose family over this you

937
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:56,160
can lose friendships over you're gonna

938
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,980
lose sleep definitely

939
00:44:58,980 --> 00:45:00,660
but you're also going to lose a poor

940
00:45:00,660 --> 00:45:02,160
mentality

941
00:45:02,160 --> 00:45:03,900
you're going to lose a lot of the things

942
00:45:03,900 --> 00:45:05,640
that held you back

943
00:45:05,640 --> 00:45:07,440
you're going to lose weight I'm telling

944
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:10,760
you boy you're gonna lose some weight

945
00:45:11,579 --> 00:45:14,599
you're gonna lose weight

946
00:45:16,380 --> 00:45:18,300
and that's that's both

947
00:45:18,300 --> 00:45:20,819
the weight

948
00:45:20,819 --> 00:45:22,500
from your body

949
00:45:22,500 --> 00:45:26,599
and the things that held you down

950
00:45:27,119 --> 00:45:30,440
things that held you down

951
00:45:31,020 --> 00:45:34,280
you'll lose that equally

952
00:45:34,619 --> 00:45:35,940
and you're going to have a different

953
00:45:35,940 --> 00:45:38,640
sense of of

954
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:39,839
you know

955
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:41,819
what reality actually is you're gonna

956
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,160
live in a different manner

957
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:46,440
you're going to lose that attitude

958
00:45:46,440 --> 00:45:49,380
to lose the anger problems that you have

959
00:45:49,380 --> 00:45:52,319
You're Gonna Lose the negative

960
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,020
self-talk

961
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:56,819
that you give you're gonna pick up some

962
00:45:56,819 --> 00:45:58,319
esteem

963
00:45:58,319 --> 00:46:00,180
You're Gonna Lose That depression that

964
00:46:00,180 --> 00:46:02,280
anxiety get rid of all of it yo those

965
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:04,760
things are gonna

966
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,140
but it starts from somewhere doing the

967
00:46:07,140 --> 00:46:09,300
same thing every single day

968
00:46:09,300 --> 00:46:10,800
same thing every single day that's what

969
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,000
I tell people I can't give you

970
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:14,819
psychology I don't know what the issues

971
00:46:14,819 --> 00:46:18,000
you know the the plague you are I don't

972
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:20,099
know what's happening

973
00:46:20,099 --> 00:46:21,300
I don't know what you're thinking in

974
00:46:21,300 --> 00:46:22,500
your mind how you feel about yourself

975
00:46:22,500 --> 00:46:24,060
how you feel about others how you feel

976
00:46:24,060 --> 00:46:25,440
about life things you're going through I

977
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,760
don't know those things so I can't give

978
00:46:26,760 --> 00:46:29,780
you psychology on that

979
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:32,400
but what I can tell you is doing the

980
00:46:32,400 --> 00:46:33,960
same thing every single day

981
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:36,900
and doing nothing but that

982
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:38,400
will put you

983
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:40,560
so far ahead

984
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:42,540
of the learning curve that when you look

985
00:46:42,540 --> 00:46:44,900
back

986
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:48,060
you're not going to be looking at

987
00:46:48,060 --> 00:46:50,099
you know I'm not where I want to be

988
00:46:50,099 --> 00:46:52,500
you'll be looking at I'm nowhere used to

989
00:46:52,500 --> 00:46:54,619
be

990
00:46:55,140 --> 00:46:57,900
now I'm where I want to be but I'm also

991
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,180
not where I used to be

992
00:47:00,180 --> 00:47:02,520
so he told me he was on the verge of

993
00:47:02,520 --> 00:47:05,099
losing

994
00:47:05,099 --> 00:47:08,040
everything and he only had one twenty

995
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:09,720
five thousand dollar account with zero

996
00:47:09,720 --> 00:47:12,680
dollars in his bank account

997
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,319
and now he has three twenty five

998
00:47:16,319 --> 00:47:19,380
thousand dollar accounts that are all up

999
00:47:19,380 --> 00:47:21,240
a hundred and thirty five thousand

1000
00:47:21,240 --> 00:47:23,339
dollars in profit

1001
00:47:23,339 --> 00:47:25,740
so that's each account has a hundred and

1002
00:47:25,740 --> 00:47:27,180
thirty five thousand dollars in profit

1003
00:47:27,180 --> 00:47:28,800
and he says some days he doesn't even

1004
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:30,780
have to trade

1005
00:47:30,780 --> 00:47:32,579
and gifts

1006
00:47:32,579 --> 00:47:35,280
this this is the kicking Disney kicker

1007
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,400
here

1008
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:40,800
guess

1009
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:44,420
how much points

1010
00:47:45,119 --> 00:47:48,380
he gets in his trades

1011
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:52,160
guess how many points

1012
00:47:52,380 --> 00:47:55,160
five

1013
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:59,160
five

1014
00:47:59,160 --> 00:48:02,119
points

1015
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:04,560
that he gets in the trades he takes

1016
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,800
five

1017
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,680
not these hundred Point stretches and

1018
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,480
and and

1019
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:14,040
you know

1020
00:48:14,040 --> 00:48:16,380
holding on all the way to the highs

1021
00:48:16,380 --> 00:48:18,599
taken out

1022
00:48:18,599 --> 00:48:21,740
Five Points

1023
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,240
and look at what

1024
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,920
for March

1025
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:27,240
to now

1026
00:48:27,240 --> 00:48:31,339
this is almost almost three months

1027
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,040
because it was April when he when he

1028
00:48:35,040 --> 00:48:37,440
really started to get it and he really

1029
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:39,060
started to stack his account it was in

1030
00:48:39,060 --> 00:48:41,359
April

1031
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,819
so three months later

1032
00:48:44,819 --> 00:48:47,760
he has three accounts three 25k accounts

1033
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:50,420
that are in

1034
00:48:50,460 --> 00:48:54,960
135 135 000 in profit

1035
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:58,040
all of them each

1036
00:48:58,380 --> 00:49:02,180
and he only takes five points

1037
00:49:04,800 --> 00:49:07,200
that's enough

1038
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:08,579
for him

1039
00:49:08,579 --> 00:49:10,140
and look at how I put that put in my

1040
00:49:10,140 --> 00:49:12,319
head

1041
00:49:13,440 --> 00:49:16,099
so

1042
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:21,300
you know I want you guys to understand

1043
00:49:21,300 --> 00:49:23,940
that there's there's so much power and

1044
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:27,660
and obedience

1045
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:30,720
so much power in

1046
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,819
you know understanding this I'm gonna go

1047
00:49:32,819 --> 00:49:35,160
through the um

1048
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:37,560
the group in July and and I'm gonna show

1049
00:49:37,560 --> 00:49:39,720
them

1050
00:49:39,720 --> 00:49:42,660
what matters most it's not being able to

1051
00:49:42,660 --> 00:49:45,780
catch every trade

1052
00:49:45,780 --> 00:49:48,359
it's not being able to take every single

1053
00:49:48,359 --> 00:49:50,520
entry you're just being able to get 10

1054
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:53,940
points 10 points a day

1055
00:49:53,940 --> 00:49:56,339
just ten points

1056
00:49:56,339 --> 00:49:59,099
on a on a pair like this is so easy to

1057
00:49:59,099 --> 00:50:00,720
get 10 points you get 10 points in one

1058
00:50:00,720 --> 00:50:02,339
candle

1059
00:50:02,339 --> 00:50:03,660
10

1060
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:06,380
points

1061
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:11,280
that you can get you see I imagined

1062
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,839
earlier when we came in here

1063
00:50:12,839 --> 00:50:15,180
I talk about how

1064
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:18,180
you know we uh uh we're gonna come below

1065
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,640
this right here and then you see a

1066
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,859
balance that'll come back around and

1067
00:50:22,859 --> 00:50:24,300
take us back into

1068
00:50:24,300 --> 00:50:27,500
the range up above here

1069
00:50:27,839 --> 00:50:30,720
now say that while we before we even got

1070
00:50:30,720 --> 00:50:32,700
to to this

1071
00:50:32,700 --> 00:50:36,319
or we might have just tapped it

1072
00:50:37,380 --> 00:50:38,819
but I'm giving you guys a confidence

1073
00:50:38,819 --> 00:50:40,560
that

1074
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:44,040
we're gonna trade below here

1075
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:46,140
and then shift backed up into back up

1076
00:50:46,140 --> 00:50:47,300
into

1077
00:50:47,300 --> 00:50:51,000
this range now particularly Drew this

1078
00:50:51,000 --> 00:50:53,900
across yeah

1079
00:50:54,119 --> 00:50:55,740
did you see us make our way right back

1080
00:50:55,740 --> 00:50:56,700
to you

1081
00:50:56,700 --> 00:50:58,380
look at the rejection that came out of

1082
00:50:58,380 --> 00:50:59,700
here

1083
00:50:59,700 --> 00:51:01,859
what happened

1084
00:51:01,859 --> 00:51:03,839
I told y'all down here I said oh that's

1085
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:06,720
a nice flip in there

1086
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:09,119
you have a low here

1087
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:11,280
you have a low here

1088
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:14,700
you have a low here we respect that low

1089
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,260
here

1090
00:51:16,260 --> 00:51:18,059
you have a low here

1091
00:51:18,059 --> 00:51:19,920
you have a low here

1092
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:21,720
you have a low here

1093
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:24,420
you have a low here

1094
00:51:24,420 --> 00:51:26,579
and at no point have we violated any

1095
00:51:26,579 --> 00:51:28,740
lows and we continue back into the

1096
00:51:28,740 --> 00:51:31,339
previous range

1097
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:33,480
multiple opportunities

1098
00:51:33,480 --> 00:51:36,559
to get in on that move

1099
00:51:38,460 --> 00:51:42,000
happens every single day I was going

1100
00:51:42,000 --> 00:51:43,619
over it with my group

1101
00:51:43,619 --> 00:51:45,240
every single day

1102
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:46,559
I don't know whether we bullish or

1103
00:51:46,559 --> 00:51:48,119
bearish on the day I have no idea I

1104
00:51:48,119 --> 00:51:49,920
don't care

1105
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:52,980
because we're intraday Traders we you

1106
00:51:52,980 --> 00:51:55,440
know scalping

1107
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:57,480
and the power of 10 points

1108
00:51:57,480 --> 00:51:59,579
is in each

1109
00:51:59,579 --> 00:52:02,280
and every swing

1110
00:52:02,280 --> 00:52:04,319
that you see here

1111
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:07,020
and whether it's the rejections from the

1112
00:52:07,020 --> 00:52:07,680
left

1113
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,900
or the continuations to the right

1114
00:52:09,900 --> 00:52:12,240
whichever side you want to take up an

1115
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,859
entry on

1116
00:52:13,859 --> 00:52:15,720
some people only see the market in a

1117
00:52:15,720 --> 00:52:16,980
short way some people only see the

1118
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:19,760
market a long way

1119
00:52:20,339 --> 00:52:22,140
good thing for me I'm probably autistic

1120
00:52:22,140 --> 00:52:25,859
so I see it both ways so you know you

1121
00:52:25,859 --> 00:52:28,500
you can be on either side of the market

1122
00:52:28,500 --> 00:52:31,500
but all you need is 10.

1123
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:33,960
you guys can do the math

1124
00:52:33,960 --> 00:52:38,339
10 points is 40 ticks

1125
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:41,160
10 points is 40 ticks

1126
00:52:41,160 --> 00:52:43,760
so

1127
00:52:43,859 --> 00:52:46,140
with

1128
00:52:46,140 --> 00:52:50,180
with One Mini contract

1129
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,160
you're getting four ticks

1130
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:55,680
it's uh

1131
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,800
five dollars per tick

1132
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,140
with two which you guys see me mostly

1133
00:53:01,140 --> 00:53:02,640
use

1134
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:05,640
it's ten dollars per tick

1135
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:09,540
so ten dollars per tick on

1136
00:53:09,540 --> 00:53:11,280
10 points

1137
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,160
that's a four hundred dollar trade

1138
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,839
that you can get one of those each and

1139
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:17,579
every day

1140
00:53:17,579 --> 00:53:20,660
or every 20 minutes

1141
00:53:21,240 --> 00:53:22,440
but you can get one of those each and

1142
00:53:22,440 --> 00:53:24,180
every day

1143
00:53:24,180 --> 00:53:28,260
in very precise areas and taking ten and

1144
00:53:28,260 --> 00:53:29,940
moving on with your day taking ten

1145
00:53:29,940 --> 00:53:32,400
moving on what you did now

1146
00:53:32,400 --> 00:53:35,819
add 10 contracts to that

1147
00:53:35,819 --> 00:53:38,760
add 20 contracts to that

1148
00:53:38,760 --> 00:53:40,440
guess what trailing drawdown or no

1149
00:53:40,440 --> 00:53:42,540
trailing drawdown

1150
00:53:42,540 --> 00:53:46,500
a lot of the times just one candle

1151
00:53:46,500 --> 00:53:49,280
has 10 in it

1152
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,520
just one candle most of the time you you

1153
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:55,859
know you might see two

1154
00:53:55,859 --> 00:53:57,780
that has 10 in it

1155
00:53:57,780 --> 00:53:59,339
whether it's short whether it's a long

1156
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:00,780
10.

1157
00:54:00,780 --> 00:54:02,819
when I first started streaming I shared

1158
00:54:02,819 --> 00:54:04,140
it on Twitter when I first started

1159
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:07,619
streaming the rules that I created when

1160
00:54:07,619 --> 00:54:09,900
I first let me actually show you you'll

1161
00:54:09,900 --> 00:54:12,559
think I'm lying

1162
00:54:13,440 --> 00:54:15,599
you'll think still think I'm lying let

1163
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:17,960
me show you

1164
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,099
because I'm a

1165
00:54:23,099 --> 00:54:25,260
great storytelling y'all always think

1166
00:54:25,260 --> 00:54:27,920
I'm lying so

1167
00:54:30,240 --> 00:54:33,119
let me show you how to see it

1168
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:35,780
right here

1169
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:42,000
look at what the rules say here

1170
00:54:42,000 --> 00:54:45,660
I said I'll take multiple entries from

1171
00:54:45,660 --> 00:54:47,520
the one minute I know I didn't put time

1172
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,980
frame but whatever

1173
00:54:49,980 --> 00:54:53,280
I said which usually comes out to 20

1174
00:54:53,280 --> 00:54:56,839
trades per stream

1175
00:54:56,880 --> 00:54:58,920
also let me know if you want me to check

1176
00:54:58,920 --> 00:55:02,040
a specific ticker for you

1177
00:55:02,040 --> 00:55:05,940
10 Pips and dip is my recommendation for

1178
00:55:05,940 --> 00:55:09,300
each trade but you can hold to wherever

1179
00:55:09,300 --> 00:55:10,859
you want

1180
00:55:10,859 --> 00:55:13,680
my trades are not Financial advice

1181
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:17,880
please consult for financial advisor

1182
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,700
that was my very first video

1183
00:55:20,700 --> 00:55:23,040
that I ever posted

1184
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:25,500
um that I ever did on this channel very

1185
00:55:25,500 --> 00:55:27,359
first video

1186
00:55:27,359 --> 00:55:28,859
when I became profitable I started

1187
00:55:28,859 --> 00:55:30,059
traveling doing all these different

1188
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:32,099
things and I'm like yo none of this is

1189
00:55:32,099 --> 00:55:34,260
fulfilling if I

1190
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:36,180
see how easy this

1191
00:55:36,180 --> 00:55:40,200
you know what I did for 210 a day 250 a

1192
00:55:40,200 --> 00:55:41,760
day for 300 a day you know what I you

1193
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:43,680
know the type of stuff I had to do the

1194
00:55:43,680 --> 00:55:45,300
amount of things that I do and you

1195
00:55:45,300 --> 00:55:46,440
didn't tell me I could do that in two

1196
00:55:46,440 --> 00:55:48,859
candles

1197
00:55:50,819 --> 00:55:53,599
what

1198
00:55:55,500 --> 00:55:57,900
it's like nah I gotta teach this and I

1199
00:55:57,900 --> 00:56:01,140
spent a whole year doing just that

1200
00:56:01,140 --> 00:56:04,140
running up my accounts

1201
00:56:04,140 --> 00:56:07,700
while just teaching people for free

1202
00:56:08,640 --> 00:56:10,680
for free

1203
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:13,460
nothing else

1204
00:56:16,619 --> 00:56:19,619
you say 10 Pips in dip you bring the

1205
00:56:19,619 --> 00:56:21,720
chips I got the Pips that's what you say

1206
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,859
all the time in the beginning

1207
00:56:26,640 --> 00:56:29,640
baby

1208
00:56:30,420 --> 00:56:34,460
you bring the chips I got the Pips baby

1209
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:37,079
and and that

1210
00:56:37,079 --> 00:56:41,400
is how all of this was

1211
00:56:41,400 --> 00:56:43,020
created because I was even learning

1212
00:56:43,020 --> 00:56:44,819
other things along the way as I started

1213
00:56:44,819 --> 00:56:46,500
to teach other people

1214
00:56:46,500 --> 00:56:48,780
I started to learn more what you guys

1215
00:56:48,780 --> 00:56:50,940
should consider is try to teach your

1216
00:56:50,940 --> 00:56:54,420
loved ones try to put into words what it

1217
00:56:54,420 --> 00:56:56,760
is that you're learning to your loved

1218
00:56:56,760 --> 00:56:59,280
ones and it's going to show you that if

1219
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,380
you can't explain it to a five-year-old

1220
00:57:01,380 --> 00:57:03,540
then

1221
00:57:03,540 --> 00:57:05,520
you need some work

1222
00:57:05,520 --> 00:57:07,619
to do you can't explain it to a

1223
00:57:07,619 --> 00:57:10,040
five-year-old

1224
00:57:10,260 --> 00:57:11,819
so yeah I've been teaching my kids read

1225
00:57:11,819 --> 00:57:16,140
up but no red red down Green up

1226
00:57:16,140 --> 00:57:19,380
there's a teaching them imbalance

1227
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:22,559
and and just like slowly walking them to

1228
00:57:22,559 --> 00:57:25,980
what does price do when it Taps into an

1229
00:57:25,980 --> 00:57:28,160
imbalance and it's going up

1230
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:30,240
what do you expect first to do if it's

1231
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:31,559
happened to an imbalance and it's going

1232
00:57:31,559 --> 00:57:32,460
down

1233
00:57:32,460 --> 00:57:36,260
just just really simple

1234
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,599
what is that institutional candle

1235
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:43,880
what is that hidden snd

1236
00:57:45,599 --> 00:57:47,940
and then you put them

1237
00:57:47,940 --> 00:57:50,339
into contacts

1238
00:57:50,339 --> 00:57:51,900
then you put them into context on the

1239
00:57:51,900 --> 00:57:53,579
trend that it's in

1240
00:57:53,579 --> 00:57:57,300
and and it there's almost just you know

1241
00:57:57,300 --> 00:57:59,400
build on that

1242
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:02,640
don't go too much into that but

1243
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:04,800
you guys should do that I said 10 Pips

1244
00:58:04,800 --> 00:58:07,260
into 10 points and you out 10 points and

1245
00:58:07,260 --> 00:58:10,260
you out 10 points of you out you take 10

1246
00:58:10,260 --> 00:58:14,900
contracts to put behind 10 points

1247
00:58:15,180 --> 00:58:18,900
you take 10 contracts to put behind ten

1248
00:58:18,900 --> 00:58:21,300
points

1249
00:58:21,300 --> 00:58:23,940
on NQ what are you at

1250
00:58:23,940 --> 00:58:26,040
two thousand dollars per trade

1251
00:58:26,040 --> 00:58:27,839
I'm sorry two thousand dollars the

1252
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:30,780
minute you the moment you enter in

1253
00:58:30,780 --> 00:58:35,720
the candle TAPS in spout comes right out

1254
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:38,579
2 000 just like that

1255
00:58:38,579 --> 00:58:40,920
there's no trailing drawdown nothing is

1256
00:58:40,920 --> 00:58:42,960
not going to come back you wait for

1257
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:44,099
anything

1258
00:58:44,099 --> 00:58:45,900
unless you holding it but you don't have

1259
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:47,460
to

1260
00:58:47,460 --> 00:58:50,579
because a lot of times just tap right in

1261
00:58:50,579 --> 00:58:53,760
and shift out we teach the manipulation

1262
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,740
we teach how to get in on the

1263
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:58,380
manipulation

1264
00:58:58,380 --> 00:59:01,319
and if you learn to be able to get that

1265
00:59:01,319 --> 00:59:04,160
10 each and every time which most times

1266
00:59:04,160 --> 00:59:07,700
almost always

1267
00:59:07,760 --> 00:59:10,200
you will

1268
00:59:10,200 --> 00:59:12,180
with just

1269
00:59:12,180 --> 00:59:17,780
10 the power of 10

1270
00:59:21,780 --> 00:59:24,540
and there are times that the

1271
00:59:24,540 --> 00:59:26,760
you know it may very well go further

1272
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:29,220
than 10. it might go into 15 might be 20

1273
00:59:29,220 --> 00:59:33,380
sting man just ride out

1274
00:59:33,780 --> 00:59:37,160
sometimes what happened too

1275
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,359
but

1276
00:59:41,579 --> 00:59:45,380
just 10 points alone

1277
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,660
can benefit you so if you're demo

1278
00:59:48,660 --> 00:59:51,900
trading and it ends up being ten dollars

1279
00:59:51,900 --> 00:59:54,599
well twenty dollars

1280
00:59:54,599 --> 00:59:57,480
or is it being 20 cents

1281
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,520
there's been 200 that would be two

1282
00:59:59,520 --> 01:00:01,799
thousand dollars whatever it is

1283
01:00:01,799 --> 01:00:04,920
if you're demo trading as long as you

1284
01:00:04,920 --> 01:00:09,799
can get the move each and every time

1285
01:00:10,079 --> 01:00:16,140
as long as you can get the move

1286
01:00:16,140 --> 01:00:18,660
each and every time it doesn't matter

1287
01:00:18,660 --> 01:00:21,480
what climate you change you're trading

1288
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:22,440
in

1289
01:00:22,440 --> 01:00:24,299
it could be a recession you also I

1290
01:00:24,299 --> 01:00:27,359
showed y'all what what the early you

1291
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:31,020
know with 2017 2016 kind of look like

1292
01:00:31,020 --> 01:00:32,940
you know even before that same type of

1293
01:00:32,940 --> 01:00:34,859
ranges where you get 50 to 100 Point

1294
01:00:34,859 --> 01:00:36,839
ranges in a day

1295
01:00:36,839 --> 01:00:40,099
but all you need is 10.

1296
01:00:40,920 --> 01:00:43,260
so I'm you know getting away from the

1297
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,480
public space and

1298
01:00:45,480 --> 01:00:47,880
you may show the

1299
01:00:47,880 --> 01:00:51,359
YouTube I mean the the uh the group

1300
01:00:51,359 --> 01:00:54,920
we show them the power of 10.

1301
01:00:55,020 --> 01:00:56,819
and how each and every day you can make

1302
01:00:56,819 --> 01:01:00,599
something happen for you with just

1303
01:01:00,599 --> 01:01:03,059
the power

1304
01:01:03,059 --> 01:01:05,339
of 10.

1305
01:01:05,339 --> 01:01:07,619
just the power of 10. look at this

1306
01:01:07,619 --> 01:01:10,319
little Canada that went in here

1307
01:01:10,319 --> 01:01:12,660
this little one right here

1308
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:15,540
this little one that tapped into the 30

1309
01:01:15,540 --> 01:01:18,780
of this year y'all see that and when it

1310
01:01:18,780 --> 01:01:20,819
pushed up

1311
01:01:20,819 --> 01:01:23,700
what'd you get on that candle

1312
01:01:23,700 --> 01:01:26,700
13.

1313
01:01:28,319 --> 01:01:31,440
on that and as if you were long

1314
01:01:31,440 --> 01:01:33,900
13 on that

1315
01:01:33,900 --> 01:01:35,640
we drag this on over here we have this

1316
01:01:35,640 --> 01:01:36,660
here

1317
01:01:36,660 --> 01:01:40,559
13 on that over here

1318
01:01:40,559 --> 01:01:43,380
from the bottom of there to to this one

1319
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:47,160
pushing up that's 15 on that

1320
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:50,880
just a few points actually a little a

1321
01:01:50,880 --> 01:01:52,200
little higher than 15 because the other

1322
01:01:52,200 --> 01:01:54,059
candle opened it

1323
01:01:54,059 --> 01:01:56,460
up so 15 on that

1324
01:01:56,460 --> 01:01:58,920
in the group we teach the zone

1325
01:01:58,920 --> 01:02:02,040
so looking price coming out of the zone

1326
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:05,420
look at Bryce tapping back into

1327
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,099
hidden s d below

1328
01:02:08,099 --> 01:02:09,900
price come back into what the 70 percent

1329
01:02:09,900 --> 01:02:12,720
of the Zone these are hitting levels and

1330
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,700
coming out of that level

1331
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:16,920
guess what

1332
01:02:16,920 --> 01:02:20,420
ain't it easy to get 10.

1333
01:02:20,520 --> 01:02:23,420
just 10 alone

1334
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:28,020
say 10 contracts

1335
01:02:28,020 --> 01:02:30,599
two grand a trade

1336
01:02:30,599 --> 01:02:32,640
whether you're drawdown is trailing you

1337
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:34,940
or not

1338
01:02:36,299 --> 01:02:39,119
you don't have to worry about that

1339
01:02:39,119 --> 01:02:42,180
because you're understanding the power

1340
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:45,720
of how easy it is

1341
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:49,880
to get 10 and get out

1342
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,720
that one short that I showed you in the

1343
01:02:51,720 --> 01:02:53,700
Discord earlier took 15 points of one

1344
01:02:53,700 --> 01:02:55,200
candle you see

1345
01:02:55,200 --> 01:02:56,819
exactly

1346
01:02:56,819 --> 01:02:58,680
and one candle

1347
01:02:58,680 --> 01:03:01,220
out

1348
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:04,200
y'all got me sweating up my shirt and

1349
01:03:04,200 --> 01:03:05,280
stuff like that might have to change

1350
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,839
this

1351
01:03:06,839 --> 01:03:10,220
I mean I am preaching

1352
01:03:11,460 --> 01:03:15,380
but I want y'all to to

1353
01:03:16,619 --> 01:03:18,720
you know really really understand the

1354
01:03:18,720 --> 01:03:20,940
idea of what I'm saying this this common

1355
01:03:20,940 --> 01:03:22,619
occurrence here I was teaching them that

1356
01:03:22,619 --> 01:03:25,040
it happens every every single day

1357
01:03:25,040 --> 01:03:28,260
every single day everybody's chasing

1358
01:03:28,260 --> 01:03:30,480
these yeah yeah we're I'm telling you

1359
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,760
the market is going down today we don't

1360
01:03:32,760 --> 01:03:34,980
even come in and want to know whether we

1361
01:03:34,980 --> 01:03:36,960
we bullish up there we don't want to

1362
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:38,700
know that we don't care

1363
01:03:38,700 --> 01:03:41,339
we do not care if we're bullish or bears

1364
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:44,460
we don't care at all

1365
01:03:44,460 --> 01:03:47,460
where am I able to get in and take time

1366
01:03:47,460 --> 01:03:49,200
that's it

1367
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,660
where can I get in

1368
01:03:51,660 --> 01:03:54,559
and take ten

1369
01:03:56,940 --> 01:03:59,640
and remember the zones that we trade

1370
01:03:59,640 --> 01:04:00,599
from

1371
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:03,780
is giving you 10 right out of it bam

1372
01:04:03,780 --> 01:04:06,619
closed

1373
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:09,660
you got to tell you how

1374
01:04:09,660 --> 01:04:12,299
like I said whether it's two contracts

1375
01:04:12,299 --> 01:04:14,160
you put on that where there's 10

1376
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,859
contracts you put on that no matter what

1377
01:04:16,859 --> 01:04:18,480
it is that you put on it

1378
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:22,460
so long as you can get the move

1379
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,319
then you have the possibility and you do

1380
01:04:25,319 --> 01:04:27,359
that all day you don't have to you're

1381
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:29,099
not just stuck with doing that you know

1382
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,079
like you got to find out one moment so

1383
01:04:31,079 --> 01:04:32,520
you're sitting on your hands and you

1384
01:04:32,520 --> 01:04:35,900
just waiting no

1385
01:04:35,900 --> 01:04:40,559
no who's waiting what

1386
01:04:40,559 --> 01:04:43,440
get away from Killzone wait for wait for

1387
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,480
uh uh you know

1388
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,880
wait for the for you know somebody to

1389
01:04:47,880 --> 01:04:49,020
stop talking because it's just

1390
01:04:49,020 --> 01:04:51,480
manipulation is that I hear this he can

1391
01:04:51,480 --> 01:04:53,220
destroy thing all the time stay out the

1392
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,380
market where they do is he can do he can

1393
01:04:55,380 --> 01:04:57,900
destroy that's called a range and that's

1394
01:04:57,900 --> 01:05:00,619
the best environment to trade in

1395
01:05:00,619 --> 01:05:04,520
arrange the stupid

1396
01:05:04,740 --> 01:05:06,059

trade in

1399
01:05:11,339 --> 01:05:14,420

Zero to Hero and to enjoy the market

1410
01:05:45,000 --> 01:05:46,140
structure

1411
01:05:46,140 --> 01:05:47,940
to video one

1412
01:05:47,940 --> 01:05:49,680
video two

1413
01:05:49,680 --> 01:05:52,440
three four five and now six

1414
01:05:52,440 --> 01:05:53,880
and then showing you in different

1415
01:05:53,880 --> 01:05:55,559
sessions

1416
01:05:55,559 --> 01:05:57,960
Asia London

1417
01:05:57,960 --> 01:06:00,180
uh and New York

1418
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:01,799
Sydney even

1419
01:06:01,799 --> 01:06:03,599
you know right out of spread hour you

1420
01:06:03,599 --> 01:06:06,480
can come in throw a Haymakers

1421
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:08,880
you know so

1422
01:06:08,880 --> 01:06:11,520
these things couldn't be applied to any

1423
01:06:11,520 --> 01:06:13,440
Market you trade and I'm hearing Futures

1424
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,839
a lot I'm here on NASDAQ you know I

1425
01:06:15,839 --> 01:06:18,240
taught on US 30 because people said that

1426
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,400
was the hardest thing to trade so

1427
01:06:20,400 --> 01:06:23,099
obviously I said why not teach on it

1428
01:06:23,099 --> 01:06:26,099
so I told on US 30

1429
01:06:26,099 --> 01:06:29,339
and now you guys see mostly you know put

1430
01:06:29,339 --> 01:06:31,859
NASDAQ on the screen but I it could be

1431
01:06:31,859 --> 01:06:33,599
on anything

1432
01:06:33,599 --> 01:06:35,579
guys guess what you can you can trade

1433
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:38,839
gold on Futures as well

1434
01:06:39,180 --> 01:06:42,000
you drink gold on Futures as well

1435
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,160
same thing apply to go yeah

1436
01:06:44,160 --> 01:06:46,039
and goal to give you

1437
01:06:46,039 --> 01:06:48,480
way more points coming out of these

1438
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:51,140
zones than

1439
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:55,200
yo

1440
01:06:55,619 --> 01:06:59,579
gold will give you way more

1441
01:06:59,579 --> 01:07:02,940
then then you know something like NASDAQ

1442
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,559
Willa or

1443
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,780
you know whatever other pair you you

1444
01:07:06,780 --> 01:07:09,260
traded

1445
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,140
very easy

1446
01:07:13,440 --> 01:07:18,079
to be able to get them 10 on goal what

1447
01:07:19,799 --> 01:07:23,480
no spread on Futures too

1448
01:07:24,720 --> 01:07:26,700
and you guys understand the power of

1449
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:30,900
these little tiny movements and why you

1450
01:07:30,900 --> 01:07:33,359
should not be you know expecting these

1451
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:35,520
these large

1452
01:07:35,520 --> 01:07:39,119
uh large entries

1453
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:41,400
some people hold gold from from here and

1454
01:07:41,400 --> 01:07:43,079
they're holding it all the way to like

1455
01:07:43,079 --> 01:07:45,119
you know

1456
01:07:45,119 --> 01:07:47,039
some of above yeah I've been holding

1457
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:49,319
gold for 1900 and I just I'm just

1458
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:51,680
waiting for it to get on up to you know

1459
01:07:51,680 --> 01:07:56,539
back to 2000 you know like no

1460
01:07:56,700 --> 01:08:00,000
you get in a quick move on go

1461
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:02,579
and quickly get out the same way you

1462
01:08:02,579 --> 01:08:04,559
traded as but gold will give you more

1463
01:08:04,559 --> 01:08:08,119
per per uh

1464
01:08:08,700 --> 01:08:11,839
per time especially in Asia

1465
01:08:11,839 --> 01:08:16,080
especially in Asia you know easy to get

1466
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,279
10 points in Asia on gold

1467
01:08:20,279 --> 01:08:23,640
London Gold scallops all the other pairs

1468
01:08:23,640 --> 01:08:25,920
they scalloped smaller ranges so that

1469
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:27,479
means your stops are smaller you know

1470
01:08:27,479 --> 01:08:29,659
it's

1471
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:31,859
boy I'll tell you yo y'all gonna learn

1472
01:08:31,859 --> 01:08:32,939
something

1473
01:08:32,939 --> 01:08:35,160
we're gonna learn today

1474
01:08:35,160 --> 01:08:37,679
I'll go learn something

1475
01:08:37,679 --> 01:08:40,198
so uh

1476
01:08:40,198 --> 01:08:41,880
you know that that was just my little

1477
01:08:41,880 --> 01:08:44,580
two cents about why y'all should be

1478
01:08:44,580 --> 01:08:46,679
taking these um

1479
01:08:46,679 --> 01:08:48,660
Concepts

1480
01:08:48,660 --> 01:08:51,120
uh seriously

1481
01:08:51,120 --> 01:08:53,759
because you don't need to catch the top

1482
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:57,779
and the entire move you know like going

1483
01:08:57,779 --> 01:09:00,238
somewhere you don't need to

1484
01:09:00,238 --> 01:09:04,939
all you need is 10 points nothing else

1485
01:09:07,679 --> 01:09:10,460
uh

1486
01:09:12,120 --> 01:09:14,939
yeah exactly yes this this tapped almost

1487
01:09:14,939 --> 01:09:16,979
everything that that everything within

1488
01:09:16,979 --> 01:09:18,000
the zone

1489
01:09:18,000 --> 01:09:19,738
this tapped almost everything with this

1490
01:09:19,738 --> 01:09:22,020
now I can take you to specific areas

1491
01:09:22,020 --> 01:09:25,020
that I would be expecting it to well I'm

1492
01:09:25,020 --> 01:09:27,299
going to be doing that in the Discord

1493
01:09:27,299 --> 01:09:29,640
specific areas that I'm expecting it to

1494
01:09:29,640 --> 01:09:32,698
tap into and what The Narrative of those

1495
01:09:32,698 --> 01:09:34,859
areas are telling me

1496
01:09:34,859 --> 01:09:37,560
The Narrative of those areas will tell

1497
01:09:37,560 --> 01:09:39,540
me where the price is going to continue

1498
01:09:39,540 --> 01:09:42,120
up above it

1499
01:09:42,120 --> 01:09:44,640
so you know the the narrative building

1500
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:47,460
process is important too but yeah this

1501
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:49,500
this is I told y'all that using these

1502
01:09:49,500 --> 01:09:51,960
zones these zones are just this is just

1503
01:09:51,960 --> 01:09:54,960
uh Child's Play this ain't no you know

1504
01:09:54,960 --> 01:09:57,780
no real stuff this is training wheels

1505
01:09:57,780 --> 01:09:59,340
when you're utilizing these zones this

1506
01:09:59,340 --> 01:10:02,520
is trading Wheels tradables trading

1507
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:04,620
Wheels this is training wheels

1508
01:10:04,620 --> 01:10:07,580
using this

1509
01:10:08,460 --> 01:10:11,600
this is just to get you to conceptualize

1510
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,940
what it is that the

1511
01:10:14,940 --> 01:10:16,260
the you know

1512
01:10:16,260 --> 01:10:18,780
I'm seeing

1513
01:10:18,780 --> 01:10:21,239
as a reason for why I'm expecting a

1514
01:10:21,239 --> 01:10:24,739
rejection in these different areas

1515
01:10:25,199 --> 01:10:27,900
but it goes a lot deeper than that so

1516
01:10:27,900 --> 01:10:30,719
this people that come in and and

1517
01:10:30,719 --> 01:10:33,060
you know they quickly jump over this but

1518
01:10:33,060 --> 01:10:36,120
this is the start of it there's there's

1519
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,040
nothing else you can do nothing's gonna

1520
01:10:38,040 --> 01:10:40,199
speed you up you don't need a one-on-one

1521
01:10:40,199 --> 01:10:41,580
me I tell everybody that you don't need

1522
01:10:41,580 --> 01:10:43,080
no one-on-one you need to book a

1523
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:45,300
one-on-one

1524
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,679
you don't need to wait for no boot camp

1525
01:10:46,679 --> 01:10:49,560
you don't even need to join my group

1526
01:10:49,560 --> 01:10:53,040
all this stuff is there but it starts

1527
01:10:53,040 --> 01:10:54,480
somewhere

1528
01:10:54,480 --> 01:10:57,500
and that's the playlist

1529
01:10:57,840 --> 01:11:00,239
you know

1530
01:11:00,239 --> 01:11:03,000
there's Blues

1531
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,760
he said it's up to tap to 70 and drop

1532
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,159
this is 70 right here

1533
01:11:08,159 --> 01:11:09,960
of the largest zones I told you would be

1534
01:11:09,960 --> 01:11:12,679
yeah

1535
01:11:14,460 --> 01:11:17,300
trading into

1536
01:11:18,480 --> 01:11:20,820
and most people are looking for this

1537
01:11:20,820 --> 01:11:23,960
high up above here

1538
01:11:26,159 --> 01:11:28,320
is it a got a little green line up there

1539
01:11:28,320 --> 01:11:30,980
there we go

1540
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:39,900
but look this this is either side as we

1541
01:11:39,900 --> 01:11:42,260
mentioned

1542
01:11:42,659 --> 01:11:44,400
whether somebody took a short hair is

1543
01:11:44,400 --> 01:11:47,960
that 10 points away from the short

1544
01:11:49,620 --> 01:11:52,699
10 points on this

1545
01:11:52,739 --> 01:11:55,820
better believe it

1546
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:03,900
so

1547
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:09,000
you don't want to dispel this

1548
01:12:09,000 --> 01:12:12,060
misconception of of you needing to catch

1549
01:12:12,060 --> 01:12:14,460
the bottom or catch the top

1550
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:18,260
all you need to do is just catch 10.

1551
01:12:21,000 --> 01:12:23,659
yep

1552
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:29,400
all you need to do

1553
01:12:29,400 --> 01:12:33,739
is catch 10. that's it

1554
01:12:41,400 --> 01:12:43,679
so uh I hope I hope that you know what

1555
01:12:43,679 --> 01:12:46,199
what I'm gonna do is um I'm gonna take

1556
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:49,320
that that uh

1557
01:12:49,320 --> 01:12:51,659
portion

1558
01:12:51,659 --> 01:12:53,400
um from this video

1559
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:54,960
and I'm actually going to put it into

1560
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,900
the playlist as the psychology part of

1561
01:12:57,900 --> 01:12:59,219
it

1562
01:12:59,219 --> 01:13:00,540
because

1563
01:13:00,540 --> 01:13:02,520
again I can't give you psychology

1564
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:05,460
specific to your situation

1565
01:13:05,460 --> 01:13:08,400
but all I can tell you is what you need

1566
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,320
to do to change it

1567
01:13:10,320 --> 01:13:12,300
you know financially

1568
01:13:12,300 --> 01:13:13,860
because there's still other problems

1569
01:13:13,860 --> 01:13:19,219
that that finances don't solve you know

1570
01:13:19,380 --> 01:13:21,480
you know as much as I'm able to do I

1571
01:13:21,480 --> 01:13:23,880
still deal with like over stimulation at

1572
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:24,840
times

1573
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,460
still deal with you

1574
01:13:26,460 --> 01:13:30,000
certain issues as regards to my health

1575
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,600
you know some days still you know have

1576
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:37,140
just mental pressure of Life all that

1577
01:13:37,140 --> 01:13:38,880
other stuff that still comes with it you

1578
01:13:38,880 --> 01:13:40,340
know

1579
01:13:40,340 --> 01:13:43,380
but I'd rather cry on a full stomach

1580
01:13:43,380 --> 01:13:46,380
than an empty stomach

1581
01:13:46,380 --> 01:13:51,020
I'd rather cry in a home than

1582
01:13:52,260 --> 01:13:54,360
you know somebody could easily toss me

1583
01:13:54,360 --> 01:13:56,540
out

1584
01:13:57,179 --> 01:13:59,940
rather cry on the way to Target

1585
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:02,540
and

1586
01:14:03,179 --> 01:14:05,280
having to go Target somebody for some

1587
01:14:05,280 --> 01:14:07,940
change you know

1588
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,820
so uh it

1589
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:13,980
it's an added bonus if you need

1590
01:14:13,980 --> 01:14:16,080
something you know

1591
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:18,739
that's it

1592
01:14:19,260 --> 01:14:21,480
but

1593
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:26,600
I'll add this part to the uh playlist as
