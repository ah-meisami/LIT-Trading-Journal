where everest my phone has gone

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,680

all right there we go

17
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,280
hopefully things are looking a bit

18
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,040
smoother

19
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,719
uh you see the rejection

20
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,560

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,879
straight up straight down

22
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,400
rejected in the middle of here

23
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:19,520

00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,720
less engagement kind of days you know so

i just got my coffee i'm actually trying

34
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,800
to finish it before

35
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,160
they come in with the questions

36
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:48,720
tell me why

37
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
i was in jamaica and

38
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,080
i got some blue mountain coffee and

39
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:56,560
the quality isn't even the same nothing

40
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,440
they really make out there is the same

41
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,760
you know anymore i don't know if they're

42
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:03,440
commercializing or what but

43
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,720
the quality was not the same

44
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,000
all right

45
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:33,599
you know i always wonder if i should

46
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:36,879
catch the um

47
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560
the thursday

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,159
uh crowd

49
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:42,959
uh later in the evening

50
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,959
because i realize thursday

51
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:46,400
is a struggle for

52
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,560
most people to get up and

53
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:50,239
you know

54
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:51,840
take care of their priorities you know

55
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,680
friday is coming at the end of the week

56
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,360
and thursday is usually a struggle

57
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,400
look at this

58
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,519
so does angela go from

59
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,839
there to there

60
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,358
yep so that top the imbalance there

61
00:04:21,358 --> 00:04:24,880
morning sean what's up how's everything

62
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,639
gonna wait a little bit to do the top

63
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:29,639
down

64
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:32,080
i just want to get a couple more people

65
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,240
in

66
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,680
yeah i swear

67
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,880
the market is something else

68
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:47,680
you know like once

69
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:53,360
once you learn that algorithm oh my gosh

70
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:54,720
it just goes

71
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,639
it's like it goes everywhere you tell it

72
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,040
to go

73
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:05,120
man

74
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,639
i gotta stop drawing these so far out

75
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:11,639

82
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:37,199
you know people that i think that are

83
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,680

to other people you know like for me i

90
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:56,720

92
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,600
you know who's out there really doing

93
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,960
this

94
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,280
not a lot of people

95
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,840
you know so

96
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:10,880
i want to um

97
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,639
be able to teach that just so more

98
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,080
people know

99
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,520
what's up good morning berea good

100
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,919
morning i say berea because i don't know

101
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,160

102
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:23,919
good morning how's everything

103
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:32,800
exactly that's exactly how i see it as

104
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,440
as passing it on like

105
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:37,840
you know i i wholeheartedly believe in

106
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:39,199
that you know

107
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:40,720
like i said anything can happen to me

108
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,840
and

109
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:44,560
then what what benefit does anybody have

110
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,720
with with this i

111
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:50,080
i go with it you know always say that um

112
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,560
the graveyard is the richest place in

113
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,919
the world

114
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:55,759
because um

115
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,560
you have so many unwritten books

116
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,639
and so many you know

117
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,880
unreal some so many recipes that were

118
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:05,360
not passed down so many

119
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,759
movies that were not created songs not

120
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:09,039
written like

121
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:11,199
ideas sat on

122
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:13,599
and all of it

123
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,560
it's with them you know uh

124
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,160
that's good i'm glad to hear that

125
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,759
everything is good in here

126
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:20,960
um

127
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,720
how old are you if the minus accident

128
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,520
i'm 30 30. i just turned 30 uh uh

129
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,800
january just now so

130
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,400
you know i know that forex space is

131
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:31,599
filled with um

132
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:34,800
a lot of younger guys um

133
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:36,400
and there's a lot of older guys in the

134
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,720
the evening crowd i think that just has

135
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:40,240
to do with um

136
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:42,160
them having to work during the day and

137
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:44,879
only having time to trade in the evening

138
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:46,000
but

139
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,960
yeah i'm like in between the space of

140
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,160
like the older people who trade and

141
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:53,759
the younger people who are like

142
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,639
influencing with it

143
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:06,080
so again this this whole thing here

144
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,319
you know ranging sideways totally

145
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:09,759
tradeable

146
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,360
easier trade amari what's up how's

147
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,160
everything easy to trade i actually have

148
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,520
my um

149
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,599
so when you see me look down i have the

150
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:19,759
chat right in front of me so i can be

151
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,280
more responsive to people as they're

152
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:22,560
writing

153
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:24,479
um

154
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:26,800
but yeah this this is totally tradable

155
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,479
you know within all of this the the

156
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,039
market opened and i these lines are all

157
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:33,679
here because i literally called all of

158
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:35,918
this

159
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,958
just like where it's going after it taps

160
00:08:38,958 --> 00:08:42,000
there you know then it came down here i

161
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,240
said it could tap this fractal and i

162
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,399
said if it comes back up here you could

163
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:48,480
probably tap into this s and d but if it

164
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:50,000
goes past this it'll come into the

165
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,839
imbalance here got to tap of the

166
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
imbalance got the equal high too

167
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:58,720
so you know we're running the lows

168
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,800
we ran both the lows this one and this

169
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:01,760
one

170
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,760
tapped into this area that i had when

171
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,519
the market opened

172
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:06,640
um

173
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:10,160
now it's just you know moving between

174
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,839
this low

175
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:15,279
and this last high

176
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:18,320
so essentially you would just wait

177
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:20,160
not like the retail wait for the

178
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,600
breakout but this is this is where it's

179
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:26,080
at it's within this area

180
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,279
um

181
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,320
you know so you can just wait um

182
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,959
for this to come out of course

183
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:34,839
but if it does go above

184
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:37,600
this um

185
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,000
all of this is mitigated up here already

186
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:41,519
so if it does go above this it could

187
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,240
likely try to take the high

188
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:46,080
because all of this up here already got

189
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,600
mitigated

190
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,720
within this area

191
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,279
let me see

192
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,320
yes yes that's exactly what we are keep

193
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,560
we're the bridge yes

194
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:02,839
and the problem with it is that the

195
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:04,560
bridge

196
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,720
it's often made to transport on top of

197
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,240
so

198
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,079
we get trampled by both generations

199
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:18,320
gen z the boomer generation we just like

200
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,000
we just get slapped back and forth

201
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,320
between them you know

202
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:26,240
it's either we're too old or too young

203
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,720
yes that's exactly it

204
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:36,399
yeah we're here in the middle

205
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,160
it's like the middle child feeling of

206
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,440
the world at least

207
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:50,480
i'm going to do the top down in a few

208
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:51,440
guys

209
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:53,680
like i mentioned the top down is always

210
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,360
always important

211
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,560
always

212
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,399
um let me actually see how long this

213
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:01,839
delay is

214
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,640
all right they did the delay is not that

215
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,440
bad this is great

216
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:16,640
you see what i'm saying

217
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:17,920
this is why you pay attention to

218
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:20,640
mitigated areas

219
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:22,320
i said that

220
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:24,160
if it runs this high

221
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
it's probably going to try to come up

222
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,600
here and take this high now we just made

223
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,600
an equal high impact remember equal

224
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,800
highs

225
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,320
are usually

226
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,079
you know liquidity

227
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:36,720
that's being stored

228
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:38,720
so usually before they run a high

229
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:41,440
they'll get to it push away from it you

230
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,839
know momentarily and then oftentimes

231
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:46,720
come back and run it um

232
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:48,399
but i have mentioned that

233
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,720
you know this area was already mitigated

234
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:51,519
here

235
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,000
so if it took this high you could expect

236
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,800
that push up to here but once you saw

237
00:11:56,800 --> 00:11:59,279
this this little rejection you already

238
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,920
know that um ict actually teaches

239
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:04,240
something called inducement i believe it

240
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:04,959
is

241
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:05,760
um

242
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:07,360
i don't know if there's another word for

243
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:09,920
it for for other traders but you know

244
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,839
inducement is essentially

245
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:13,839
the concept of price

246
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,399
trading to take out the high

247
00:12:16,399 --> 00:12:18,480
and what you have is

248
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:21,519
people see it going to that direction

249
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,240
and they want to jump in to go just

250
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:25,600
above the high

251
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:29,040
and then price trades away from the high

252
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,040
and once they see it trade away from the

253
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:32,000
high

254
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,720
they're in drawdown and they jump out

255
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:36,839
then they try to jump into a

256
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:39,920
cell and take the cell down now it's

257
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:41,680
buying back up

258
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,680
you know like it's it's kind of like

259
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,800
that um so it's based on our psychology

260
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,880
you know like humans we have this fear

261
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,480
of missing out

262
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:52,720
fomo they call it you know and that's a

263
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,279
very real thing we do have the fear of

264
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
missing out look at all the homes that

265
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,839
they're buying and look at exactly

266
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:01,040
exactly

267
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:02,959
activating buy stops after taking the

268
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,560
high see i didn't want to explain it in

269
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:07,920
that technical way you know but yes yes

270
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,000
that's exactly what it is it's

271
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:13,440
you know buy stops up here you know

272
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:15,200
cell stops up here there's there's a

273
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,200
bunch of stuff here stop losses that are

274
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:18,320
back here

275
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,680
you know

276
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,160
people getting involved up here thinking

277
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:24,639
that it would run the low then it comes

278
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:26,000
takes them out

279
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,760
up here and they could possibly even

280
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,800
still reject from up here and take these

281
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,800
lows out as well you know but that's

282
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:34,560
exactly what it does like this is why i

283
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:35,920
said that um

284
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
pips of persia

285
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,399
has a good video on liquidity

286
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:42,720
and i mean once you understand liquidity

287
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:43,680
then

288
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:45,440
there's a lot of stuff that you like a

289
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,600
lot of trades that you tend to stay out

290
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:50,399
of or you know where it's going you know

291
00:13:50,399 --> 00:13:51,440
how to

292
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:54,000
like attack that trait

293
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,680
you know so

294
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:57,760
that's a and i always say that you know

295
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,120
like any time you see a a long-standing

296
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,600
you know like low or or high that was

297
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:05,839
there that that like a lower high

298
00:14:05,839 --> 00:14:06,880
that

299
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,199
that has to do with the structure

300
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:11,120
you know not just any lower high anyway

301
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:12,399
but that has to do with the structure

302
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,240
there's always a run of it and then a

303
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
huge push up you know so it could run

304
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,839
the low then have a huge push up

305
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:22,399
and then later on return to the low so

306
00:14:22,399 --> 00:14:24,800
yeah it's activating you know the buy

307
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:26,160
stops

308
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:28,800
the sell stops you know depending on the

309
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,720
side of the market you're on like yeah

310
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:33,040
it's it's essentially trickery like that

311
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,240
that's all it really is you ever saw um

312
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,959
uh what's this guy uh

313
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:40,880
i forgot his name but i know a lot of

314
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,720
people you know play those little cup

315
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,360
games after him um

316
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,360
you know they have where they place

317
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,040
something on the table and they take the

318
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,199
cups and you know like you think it's

319
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:53,519
one and you you think you know it was

320
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,399
that one but then it's not open the cup

321
00:14:56,399 --> 00:14:58,880
is not there start mixing it around

322
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,720
again open the cup again it's not there

323
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:02,720
but you swore it was under there you

324
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,160
know

325
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,920
that's exactly how the market is like

326
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:08,240
they they play on on your psychology

327
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,920
that same way

328
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,839
you know so

329
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:13,440
this is this is why

330
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,519
you know paying attention to to this

331
00:15:15,519 --> 00:15:17,360
stuff is important like especially in

332
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,040
real time this is why i teach on the one

333
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:19,920
minute

334
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:21,600
rather than teaching on the higher time

335
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:24,079
frames because everything that happens

336
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,560
on this time frame regardless of where

337
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,720
we are in the chart regardless of

338
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,720
whether it's a reversal from the bottom

339
00:15:30,720 --> 00:15:32,959
or the top or whatever you'll see on

340
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,040
every other time frame but why wait

341
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,000
10 15 trading days to understand one

342
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
concept when i could teach it all here

343
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,320
within like 30 minutes you know to an

344
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,440
hour

345
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,279
and then you can just come back and

346
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,839
learn it over and over and over again

347
00:15:49,839 --> 00:15:51,600
you know and learn it in real time

348
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,600
that's why i do what i do because it's

349
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,880
real time

350
00:15:54,880 --> 00:15:56,959
i don't believe back testing is helpful

351
00:15:56,959 --> 00:15:57,920
yes

352
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,680
but i do not believe there's some people

353
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:01,680
that back test and they kill it

354
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,279
and then they come to the live markets

355
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:04,399
and it's like

356
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:06,399
they looking like scooby-doo out there

357
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:07,600
you know so

358
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:10,240
i pretty much try to break that barrier

359
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:11,759
between like

360
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,480
understanding things in real time

361
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,040
and and just like perfecting a strategy

362
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:19,279
over what has happened in the past

363
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:20,880
you know because you wanted like

364
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:22,720
liquidity grabs are there in the past

365
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:25,199
but they don't always look the same

366
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,600
so you just got to make sure that that

367
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,440
you understand that when you're back

368
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:32,639
testing yeah the the ict order block or

369
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:34,720
demand zone might be hit

370
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:36,399
you know but

371
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:38,399
when you come to the live market what

372
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,320
happens when it doesn't get hit

373
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,240
how do you respond to that

374
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:44,639
now you're kind of stuck between not

375
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:47,199
really knowing how to

376
00:16:47,199 --> 00:16:51,040
you know manage yourself in in a trade

377
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:53,360
so this is why i like to teach in live

378
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,199
markets i get that it's you know

379
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,480
loquacious and and long-winded but

380
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,440
you know if you could sit and and learn

381
00:17:01,440 --> 00:17:02,639
and just

382
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:05,760
watch what it is that's that's going on

383
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:07,919
then i'm telling you it it will change

384
00:17:07,919 --> 00:17:09,280
your life forever

385
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:11,119
like you may not have enough time to do

386
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:14,400
that now but this can cause your life to

387
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,160
become

388
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:18,079
you know it can cause it to go in a

389
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,559
direction or in a way of now you have

390
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,400
time to do everything

391
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,919
you have a time to do whatever you want

392
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,959
now you have too much time on your hands

393
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:28,880
and everything that you do can be

394
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,039
replaced with a service

395
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:32,480
you know like

396
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,160
own personal cook

397
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,600
you know your own maid don't have to

398
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,280
worry about cleaning up behind the kids

399
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:40,160
you know have your own driver like those

400
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:42,559
things yeah that's that's not the goal

401
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:44,160
yeah some of those things could be you

402
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:48,080
know little superficial or whatever but

403
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:52,240
if it if it takes away from your time

404
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,640
and causes you not to be able to grow in

405
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,320
other areas

406
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,559
then that's not something that's good

407
00:17:58,559 --> 00:18:00,720
for you and that's

408
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:03,520
95 or that's probably a little too low

409
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:06,480
99 of jobs out there

410
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,919
are like that 99

411
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:13,600
you work five days only to have two off

412
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:15,120
sometimes you work eight hours sometimes

413
00:18:15,120 --> 00:18:18,160
you work 16 hours

414
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:20,160
sometimes the work is heavy sometimes

415
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,840
the work is lighter

416
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,880
all for the same pay

417
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:27,200
you know like no i i

418
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:29,360
like i want people to break out of that

419
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,320
because

420
00:18:30,320 --> 00:18:32,880
you are worth millions of dollars to

421
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:34,480
that company

422
00:18:34,480 --> 00:18:35,760
you are worth

423
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:38,720
millions of dollars

424
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,320
to that company your position alone

425
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:45,440
you're worth millions of dollars

426
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:47,679
so if you are indeed worth millions of

427
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:50,400
dollars to that company

428
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,200
why not go and create that for yourself

429
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,200
you know

430
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:57,120
and that's why we're here

431
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:59,520
what's up nicholas how's everything

432
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,480
that's why we're here

433
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:03,600
to

434
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:07,200
to learn this to master this

435
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:08,799
and then we create a freedom for

436
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:10,799
ourselves

437
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,799
i always say that um

438
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:14,559
washes and balance here between here

439
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:17,360
guys um you know but i ultimately

440
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:18,880
probably have it coming down into this

441
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:22,640
area um i often say

442
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,640

00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,720
he already is further ahead than than

456
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,520
like

457
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:55,520
a lot of people who knew nothing about

458
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,280
it and just started learning he already

459
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,039
is further ahead than a lot of those

460
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:00,640
people you know so

461
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:02,080
craig keep coming through with your

462
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,760
enthusiasm and

463
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,360
and your hard work you're gonna get it

464
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,840
brother

465
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:10,240
you see what i mentioned here guys let

466
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,520
me see if it actually tapped

467
00:20:13,520 --> 00:20:16,400
that um

468
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,679
that midway point

469
00:20:22,720 --> 00:20:24,799
yeah look at that

470
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:26,640
see i said watch this imbalance guys and

471
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,840
went back to chat my mouth

472
00:20:31,840 --> 00:20:34,000
these these imbalance plays a really

473
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,400
good like quick plays that you can just

474
00:20:36,400 --> 00:20:38,799
grab a quick scalp from but this one

475
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,679
obviously took us above both highs

476
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:43,440
but this is this is what i'm talking

477
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:46,240
about with we're in balance and where

478
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:47,600
you know um

479
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:50,080
displacement and absorption

480
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:53,200
those things you want to make sure that

481
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:55,679
you you pay attention to or you try to

482
00:20:55,679 --> 00:20:58,159
get within your um

483
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:00,480
you know style of trading because that

484
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,159
can be very very beneficial for you

485
00:21:04,159 --> 00:21:06,720
uh in in the discord will there be a

486
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:10,159
live trading room yeah so um that's what

487
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:12,480
uh the the um

488
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:14,720
media guy is working on the

489
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:16,400
he's wondering if

490
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,480
there should be live channels in there

491
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,360
or not um i think that live channels

492
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:23,280
would be pretty cool to have pretty

493
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,320
important

494
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:25,360
um

495
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,200
you know so i i think that that's

496
00:21:27,200 --> 00:21:29,120
something that we will do just in case

497
00:21:29,120 --> 00:21:30,400
you know like there might be somebody

498
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,080
else that that wants to go live in there

499
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,520
i mean akeem could probably want to go

500
00:21:33,520 --> 00:21:36,159
live in there and and you know just show

501
00:21:36,159 --> 00:21:37,840
you guys some of the stuff that he's

502
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,760
working with you know and that not a

503
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,799
problem

504
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:42,480
you know so i think that that's a

505
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:45,039
component that we will have in um

506
00:21:45,039 --> 00:21:46,720
the um

507
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,000
the

508
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,480
discord

509
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:54,400
let's do this top down now guys

510
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,559
no doubt akeem i'm glad to have you on

511
00:21:56,559 --> 00:21:58,480
board

512
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:02,080
yeah so so oh that's right yesterday i

513
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:04,159
for remember how i told you guys that

514
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,640
media like like news events do not

515
00:22:06,640 --> 00:22:07,520
matter

516
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:08,960
at all

517
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,039
i told you that you do not have to pay

518
00:22:11,039 --> 00:22:14,400
attention to whether news is good or bad

519
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,880
technical analysis can

520
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:18,880
show you those things

521
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:23,440
so yesterday let me actually uh

522
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:25,280
where are we

523
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:28,559
let me show you guys this

524
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:35,039
let me um

525
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:37,280
let me actually bring this

526
00:22:37,280 --> 00:22:38,840
uh

527
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,400
down bring that music down

528
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:44,400
let me show you guys this

529
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,919
uh why is this small

530
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,679
because we marked up areas yesterday

531
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:54,679
um

532
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:59,600
oh why did that just disappear

533
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:01,120
all right here we go

534
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,200
yeah we we marked up some areas

535
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,559
yesterday

536
00:23:04,559 --> 00:23:06,400
um

537
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:09,600
that kind of you know displayed this

538
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,840
where is it let me see if i can find the

539
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,400
volume

540
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,919
yeah look at this hey guys

541
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:22,640
these are some areas that we marked up

542
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:24,080
yesterday

543
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:28,120
when we were doing the top down

544
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,520
so we mentioned that there would be a a

545
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:46,720
huge bounce off of 32

546
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,559
whatever it was i'll go back to the

547
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,760
chart now and show you guys

548
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:53,120
um

549
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,840
so here's where it was

550
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,360
we had mentioned

551
00:23:57,360 --> 00:23:58,720
in the top down

552
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:00,640
we talked about this trend line and and

553
00:24:00,640 --> 00:24:02,400
how they manipulate trend lines and

554
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:03,200
stuff

555
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,520
but um we had mentioned that we would

556
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:07,200
come down to

557
00:24:07,200 --> 00:24:08,240
thirty

558
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,440
thirty thousand two fifty three

559
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,120
and we could potentially have a huge

560
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:14,559
reversal up

561
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:16,880
to the top of this area to take this

562
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:18,559
high

563
00:24:18,559 --> 00:24:20,400
and if you look

564
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:22,960
we tapped right into this area

565
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,600
and pushed all the way up and

566
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,919
immediately took out the high now this

567
00:24:27,919 --> 00:24:30,480
is when fomc started apparently

568
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,320
you know they raised the interest rates

569
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:34,159
and and there was some other discussion

570
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,240
about tackling inflation and what could

571
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,320
happen over the next month so you tend

572
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,000
to get a lot of that whip sawing

573
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,120
movement

574
00:24:41,120 --> 00:24:42,720
you know um

575
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:44,799
tuesday we'll come back in a few minutes

576
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:46,799
all right no problem brother

577
00:24:46,799 --> 00:24:49,120
uh yeah i just went untouched

578
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:51,600
yeah exactly the the top down i have

579
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:54,000
mentioned that how they usually you know

580
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:56,240
create or store up some liquidity around

581
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:58,799
here and they end up running it this was

582
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:00,720
the whole trend line i told you guys the

583
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,720
whole trend line can be ran

584
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:05,200
so look it taps right into this area and

585
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:08,960
pushed up immediately to this area

586
00:25:08,960 --> 00:25:09,919
right here

587
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,360
from this to this

588
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:14,880
641 pips

589
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:17,039
if if you just you know this is why i

590
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:18,640
always say take a picture of the area

591
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:20,480
screenshot the area whatever it is you

592
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,279
need to do but i have mentioned that we

593
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:25,679
would probably come up to this area

594
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:26,720
first

595
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:29,919
and mitigate this area above

596
00:25:29,919 --> 00:25:32,080
and then come down

597
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,279
news started we shot straight up tapped

598
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:38,480
into this area shot straight down where

599
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:40,480
did this area top

600
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,600
i had an imbalance all the way over here

601
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,520
this is why i say these areas you gotta

602
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:47,120
you guys got to pay attention to these

603
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,279
areas that are untouched because they

604
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:52,240
can surprisingly give you strong moves

605
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:54,320
out of the area and and you don't even

606
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:56,559
know why like oh it didn't hit a demand

607
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:58,400
zone or it didn't hit a supply zone in

608
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,320
the order block you know didn't hit a

609
00:26:00,320 --> 00:26:02,240
fractal so

610
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,480
what what can it potentially hit like

611
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,400
you have those huge pushes from the

612
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:08,559
middle of some of these areas and you're

613
00:26:08,559 --> 00:26:09,600
wondering

614
00:26:09,600 --> 00:26:12,159
why did it just shoot up from

615
00:26:12,159 --> 00:26:13,840
from just the middle of the area it

616
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:16,240
didn't find support on anything you know

617
00:26:16,240 --> 00:26:18,320
and that's because these imbalances that

618
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:20,880
are here so this this imbalance is from

619
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:22,640
june 14th

620
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,840
and if you go all the way over

621
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,640
when price started to whip saw

622
00:26:28,640 --> 00:26:30,159
so it hit the area that i said it was

623
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:31,360
coming to

624
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:32,880
and then it went straight to the next

625
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,080
target

626
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:36,480
what's the next target right here

627
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:39,600
this top this is the next target the

628
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,000
imbalance that's to the left

629
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,000
because everything else already is

630
00:26:44,000 --> 00:26:45,919
mitigated through here

631
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:48,799
every maybe not this area here but

632
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:50,799
everything else is already mitigated so

633
00:26:50,799 --> 00:26:52,320
why would you be looking i told you it

634
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:54,159
would run the whole trend line

635
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:56,640
so if it ran the whole trend line it

636
00:26:56,640 --> 00:26:58,960
found some support right here

637
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:01,120
pushed back up and i put this when i saw

638
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:03,760
this accumulating here i actually put

639
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,840
this arrow here and i said it could

640
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,480
potentially go up and touch into

641
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:10,799
you know this snd that's right here

642
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,240
because everything else was already

643
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,240
mitigated this s d is mitigated this

644
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:16,880
one's mitigated this one's mitigated so

645
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,640
i said that it could potentially go up

646
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,200
touch into this s and d that's exactly

647
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:24,240
where it tapped bam right there

648
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:25,600
pushed away

649
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:28,320
had a second tap on on you know the line

650
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:30,080
that i originally drew to

651
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:31,840
you know had a little pump up but i

652
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:33,360
would have saw that this was only

653
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,000
attacking the imbalance that was here

654
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:37,520
would have got a short from the

655
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:39,440
imbalance and then look pushed all the

656
00:27:39,440 --> 00:27:42,880
way down into the area that we marked up

657
00:27:42,880 --> 00:27:46,399
and then immediately shot up there

658
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:49,600
and this is why top-down analysis is

659
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,799
very very important because yeah i mean

660
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:54,559
i'm not always right

661
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:56,480
but you have to consider

662
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,000
like if

663
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:00,720
if you guys are watching and seeing

664
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,200
somebody on stream like

665
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:05,279
you know call it from this direction or

666
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:07,360
that direction or that direction like at

667
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:09,360
some point like there has to be some

668
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:11,760
type of belief that yo nobody else is

669
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,520
doing this like

670
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:15,440
you know maybe i should

671
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,480
you know bunker down on whatever this

672
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,640
guy is teaching because

673
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:22,880
this is happening right in front of our

674
00:28:22,880 --> 00:28:23,840
eyes

675
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:25,840
you know and that's why i do it to not

676
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:27,679
only you know prove

677
00:28:27,679 --> 00:28:29,440
prove people wrong which i'm not

678
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:31,039
necessarily here to prove people wrong

679
00:28:31,039 --> 00:28:33,200
i'm trying to my the end goal is to help

680
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,240
people become wealthy you know but

681
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,440
you know if you guys are seeing this

682
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,919
happening like i would double down on

683
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:42,000
this information i would double down on

684
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,039
on

685
00:28:43,039 --> 00:28:45,440
you know what's being given because

686
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:47,760
like this type of quality

687
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:49,200
you know it's either you're paying for

688
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,600
some type of mentorship

689
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,919
you know for this or or you're just not

690
00:28:53,919 --> 00:28:55,279
getting it at all

691
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:57,200
you know because i i remember all the

692
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,360
things that i've been taught and i still

693
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,760
see those things like do you know how

694
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:03,840
hard it is not to see a head and

695
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:06,640
shoulders pattern i still see head and

696
00:29:06,640 --> 00:29:08,799
shoulders batteries i still see double

697
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,799
tops double bottoms i still see all of

698
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,720
that but now i see it from a different

699
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:13,840
view

700
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,919
now i understand that double bottoms are

701
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:18,880
manipulated double tops are manipulated

702
00:29:18,880 --> 00:29:20,080
you know so

703
00:29:20,080 --> 00:29:22,240
head and shoulders patterns they

704
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,480
they their absence of structure they

705
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,360
have no actual technical

706
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:29,120
um structure in it other than that you

707
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:31,679
can draw it and it looks like one

708
00:29:31,679 --> 00:29:33,120
you know so

709
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:35,120
i still can't get rid of those things in

710
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:36,399
my head

711
00:29:36,399 --> 00:29:38,000
but

712
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,640
you know when i learned how to

713
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,039
trade in the manner than a trade

714
00:29:43,039 --> 00:29:44,720
i actually

715
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,640
you know was able to put some rules to

716
00:29:46,640 --> 00:29:49,600
those things and then if price followed

717
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:51,120
those rules then it's like okay yeah

718
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,480
that's a head and shoulders pattern yeah

719
00:29:52,480 --> 00:29:53,840
it's a double bottom yeah it's a double

720
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,640
top

721
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,760
and

722
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,640
it needs to have specific rules to it

723
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:00,320
now i don't use those patterns to trade

724
00:30:00,320 --> 00:30:03,120
anymore but if if you

725
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:05,039
give your your patterns or whatever it

726
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:06,960
is you trade with some structural rules

727
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:09,039
then they could definitely work out for

728
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:10,960
you i do believe trend lines can work

729
00:30:10,960 --> 00:30:13,600
out i'm not saying only use trend lines

730
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:15,279
but i do believe trend lines can work

731
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,640
out if you're using structure with it so

732
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,640
structure supply and demand

733
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:23,039
only thing you guys need only thing you

734
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,720
guys will ever need

735
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,080
so um

736
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:29,200
let's do this top down now uh i guess i

737
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,960
can delete all of this

738
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:32,880
um because i have a whole video

739
00:30:32,880 --> 00:30:34,799
explaining this

740
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:37,520
so let me get this out of here

741
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,260
and um

742
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:39,520
[Music]

743
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,520
go to the daily now

744
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,760
what do we have

745
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,720
on the daily

746
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:51,840
well just more sell no sell-off sell-off

747
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:54,080
sell off

748
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,799
oh we did run this low

749
00:30:56,799 --> 00:30:58,240
yeah sometimes

750
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,919
i told you whenever we run a low

751
00:30:59,919 --> 00:31:01,600
sometimes you might have some lingering

752
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:03,279
around the low

753
00:31:03,279 --> 00:31:05,679
and then price would just fall out of it

754
00:31:05,679 --> 00:31:07,679
and that you know that can happen

755
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:10,240
sometimes too

756
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:12,240
like right here

757
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,320
you had to run of the low here

758
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:16,240
you had some lingering around

759
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:18,640
and you fell came back up a little more

760
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,399
lingering in the area this is a daily

761
00:31:20,399 --> 00:31:21,919
candle by the way so

762
00:31:21,919 --> 00:31:24,000
um you know one hour four hours these

763
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,159
are probably you know right across this

764
00:31:26,159 --> 00:31:27,840
area and then

765
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,159
falls

766
00:31:30,159 --> 00:31:31,679
i don't know why it happens that way

767
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:34,240
that's just something that i've noticed

768
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,200
um

769
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:39,039
so this was an area that i had price

770
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,320
going to

771
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,519
right here

772
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:46,880
yeah

773
00:31:46,880 --> 00:31:48,880
this was an area that i had price going

774
00:31:48,880 --> 00:31:51,679
to but if you look that full body is in

775
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,039
it so

776
00:31:53,039 --> 00:31:55,760
i would actually

777
00:31:55,760 --> 00:31:58,240
mark the low

778
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,880
of this area

779
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,320
because it looked like it looks like

780
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,000
that's what it's that's what it's

781
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:05,840
potentially coming for

782
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:07,840
or i would actually let me let me

783
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:10,880
actually put another line right here

784
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:13,880
um

785
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,799
here

786
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:22,000
yeah watch this top right here

787
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:23,679
because if you guys look

788
00:32:23,679 --> 00:32:25,600
this remember i said these wicks can

789
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:27,600
sometimes be hidden supply and demand

790
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:29,039
zones

791
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:32,480
so we could have a tap off of this

792
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,799
or or even within this you can you could

793
00:32:34,799 --> 00:32:36,960
even come i don't know like

794
00:32:36,960 --> 00:32:40,320
50 of the way within this maybe

795
00:32:40,320 --> 00:32:43,720
let me see

796
00:32:44,799 --> 00:32:47,519
yeah it could even come 50 of the way

797
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:50,640
um within this let me actually put this

798
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:54,919
here a little price balloon

799
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,960
sorry i have like ocd sometimes so i

800
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,240
need to

801
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:05,600
get the exact number

802
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:11,440
come on stop shaking hand there we go

803
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:13,760
all right

804
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:14,330
so

805
00:33:14,330 --> 00:33:16,320
[Music]

806
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:19,120
this is the daily

807
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:21,279
um if it passes through this then it's

808
00:33:21,279 --> 00:33:23,440
probably just gonna

809
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,840
run this low here

810
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,080
um

811
00:33:28,559 --> 00:33:31,440
and it could have a tap and a swado push

812
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:33,640
up so it's 879

813
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:37,440
768 and 653.

814
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,720
um

815
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:41,840
so let me go to the four hour now

816
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:44,320
and look across the way because we have

817
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:47,600
like nothing here

818
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:50,000
ah

819
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:56,159
so on the four hour look at this wow

820
00:33:56,559 --> 00:34:01,360
on the four hour we have this here

821
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:04,960
we have this area what is this uh

822
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:06,960
8 23

823
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,520
on the 4r let me just mark this over

824
00:34:09,520 --> 00:34:11,760
here

825
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:19,560
so we have an area at 8 23.

826
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,520
8 23. oh i forgot to turn back on the

827
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:28,480
music my bad yo

828
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,399
because my kid

829
00:34:30,399 --> 00:34:33,359
is annoying so i understand

830
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,839
um

831
00:34:37,040 --> 00:34:38,639
so we

832
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:41,040
oh look we just grabbed that low though

833
00:34:41,040 --> 00:34:42,480
um

834
00:34:42,480 --> 00:34:44,960
i told you sometimes we grab the low and

835
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:47,520
then have a push back up

836
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:51,040
so watch that let me go to the hourly so

837
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:53,839
we have this area here 823

838
00:34:53,839 --> 00:34:56,159
um

839
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:02,960
and everything is all the way back here

840
00:35:02,960 --> 00:35:07,760
jesus and the christ of nazareth

841
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,079
all right so this is the last down area

842
00:35:14,079 --> 00:35:17,359
here so let's jeez these candles just

843
00:35:17,359 --> 00:35:20,880
get longer and longer down here

844
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,520
so what number is this

845
00:35:28,839 --> 00:35:30,560
uh

846
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:33,520
nine i'm 790

847
00:35:33,520 --> 00:35:35,280
it looks like

848
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:38,560
do we have anything here

849
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:43,599
so 790

850
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:45,119
790.

851
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,800
doesn't this feel like the price is

852
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:49,599
right or something

853
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:53,520
790

854
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,440
okay

855
00:35:55,440 --> 00:35:58,000
looks like we're pushing down to this 79

856
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:59,760
area here

857
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:02,240
uh now we got to go all the way back

858
00:36:02,240 --> 00:36:04,320
here come on roll the wheel with me

859
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,880
everyone

860
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:09,359
the music sounds on brand right wow i

861
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,240
can't go back here on the 15 minute oh

862
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:15,200
my gosh

863
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,920
geez

864
00:36:18,400 --> 00:36:22,320
all right yeah i have nothing back there

865
00:36:23,520 --> 00:36:25,280
15 minute one allowed me to go there

866
00:36:25,280 --> 00:36:29,200
guys so we are falling in this abyss

867
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:32,000
and we only have these larger time frame

868
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,240
areas to work with

869
00:36:34,240 --> 00:36:37,920
um after that like i

870
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:39,680
i mean this is a lot of space within

871
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:42,160
here let me actually just um

872
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:43,920
place some

873
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:46,240
some lines here

874
00:36:46,240 --> 00:36:47,599
um

875
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,400
remember these are just reaction areas

876
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:52,079
um

877
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,440
i would wait until the one minute shows

878
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:56,400
you

879
00:36:56,400 --> 00:36:59,760
that it's reacting to reverse from these

880
00:36:59,760 --> 00:37:02,880
areas that's what i would wait for

881
00:37:02,880 --> 00:37:05,920
not not the actual touch of these areas

882
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:07,680
because these are higher time frame

883
00:37:07,680 --> 00:37:09,839
areas so with the higher time frame

884
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:12,560
areas there could possibly be drawdown

885
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,560
on the lower time frame

886
00:37:14,560 --> 00:37:16,160
while the higher time frame still looks

887
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:18,240
like it's just a wick that that went

888
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:19,520
through the area

889
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:23,839
so just uh be mindful of that

890
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:26,800
only on the one minute do we play like

891
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,520
the exact touch of it if it's anything

892
00:37:29,520 --> 00:37:31,119
higher than that

893
00:37:31,119 --> 00:37:32,320
then

894
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:34,560
you know we want to wait till we start

895
00:37:34,560 --> 00:37:36,880
to see price flip

896
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,880
and when we start to see price flip

897
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,040
within that area that's when we make

898
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,560
that decision

899
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:43,359
not

900
00:37:43,359 --> 00:37:45,920
from the higher time frames

901
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,760
so we want to see price

902
00:37:47,760 --> 00:37:50,960
tap into one of our areas and then start

903
00:37:50,960 --> 00:37:54,560
to sideways consolidate

904
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,240
um

905
00:38:00,560 --> 00:38:03,280
did i ever

906
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,599
no but we've we pretty much was working

907
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:07,520
through this entire thing but yeah

908
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:09,280
obviously we're

909
00:38:09,280 --> 00:38:12,160
we're shorting into some of these areas

910
00:38:12,160 --> 00:38:13,839
that we just grabbed on the top down i

911
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:15,520
don't know did anybody need me to to

912
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:17,520
stop and let them screenshot the numbers

913
00:38:17,520 --> 00:38:19,680
or something or did you guys

914
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:22,480
place them already

915
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:24,079
if anything they're right here again

916
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:27,119
these are higher time frame areas so

917
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:29,200
these higher time frame areas

918
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:31,359
you don't want to see a tap and go

919
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:33,839
because these areas are not from this

920
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:36,640
time frame the tap and go is on

921
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:38,400
the one minute i would even say the five

922
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:41,440
minute not these higher time frame areas

923
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:42,320
so

924
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,480
you're essentially looking for a

925
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:47,200
reversal point or a continuation

926
00:38:47,200 --> 00:38:51,560
whenever it is that you're trading these

927
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:08,079
and sometimes within within these falls

928
00:39:08,079 --> 00:39:10,560
be mindful of price doing this you see

929
00:39:10,560 --> 00:39:13,440
this wick right here

930
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:16,400
be mindful of price

931
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,000
this wick here

932
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,839
be mindful of price doing things like

933
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,760
that um that's just to feel the

934
00:39:21,760 --> 00:39:24,079
imbalance that's there so you have a

935
00:39:24,079 --> 00:39:26,480
quick push up fills the imbalance and

936
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:29,280
then continues to trade away so just be

937
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,960
mindful um

938
00:39:30,960 --> 00:39:33,920
when you see that huge push up on the

939
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:37,880
next candle that opens

940
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,599
see if i was on the 15 it could give me

941
00:39:45,599 --> 00:39:47,599
a little more accurate

942
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,839
um

943
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:52,079
like a more accurate area to this but i

944
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:55,359
hate that trade-in view actually has

945
00:39:55,359 --> 00:39:57,520
you know only a limited number of data

946
00:39:57,520 --> 00:39:59,040
you can go back to

947
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:03,800
um 29 715 okay that that works

948
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:06,640
715 so that's about through here yeah

949
00:40:06,640 --> 00:40:10,000
that that would that would be consistent

950
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,800
29 7 15 i think that's the

951
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:16,160
the middle of um the s d that i have on

952
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,800
the on the daily i think it is

953
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,280
so yeah see i i know you know what you

954
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:23,760
talking about brother

955
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:27,040
so that's that's overall um

956
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,200
the the area that price can bounce and

957
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,839
have that huge v-shape recovery or

958
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,160
reversal from

959
00:40:34,160 --> 00:40:36,480
so price will create these little areas

960
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:37,440
here

961
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,599
continue to fall create some more of the

962
00:40:39,599 --> 00:40:41,760
areas here continue to fall and then

963
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:43,440
you'll see price go up to those areas

964
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,440
and potentially react from those areas

965
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:47,680
too

966
00:40:48,400 --> 00:40:49,359
so yeah

967
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:50,400
it um

968
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,480
let me actually place these numbers

969
00:40:52,480 --> 00:40:54,640
closer for us to see so i don't have to

970
00:40:54,640 --> 00:40:56,079
keep

971
00:40:56,079 --> 00:41:00,000
scrolling out so bam

972
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:04,040
bam

973
00:41:16,480 --> 00:41:18,960
and then this

974
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,119
remember this is the low let me actually

975
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:23,520
just make this red

976
00:41:23,520 --> 00:41:27,119
so it stands out differently

977
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:30,000
and

978
00:41:32,839 --> 00:41:35,280
then yeah so it already fell through

979
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,079
this

980
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:37,839
here

981
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:39,520
and and this is also what i love about

982
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:43,280
these reactionary areas um

983
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,520
what i love is the fact that

984
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:47,200
if you ever

985
00:41:47,200 --> 00:41:49,440
like end up in drawdown

986
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,680
because this was a wrong area for you to

987
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:53,920
trade from you know or or you just

988
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,079
impulsively got in and still went

989
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:58,720
through oftentimes it does give you that

990
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:02,319
opportunity to get out at break even

991
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:04,560
oftentimes it goes back to the area or

992
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:06,480
get out like a little bit in profit as i

993
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,680
usually say

994
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:08,800
so um

995
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:10,480
yeah that's what i love about using

996
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:12,240
these zones that even when they go

997
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:13,920
through it oftentimes they return back

998
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:17,160
to it

999
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,920
yeah exactly exactly john those my

1000
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,079
favorite areas

1001
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:26,240
that's why i only only take trades from

1002
00:42:26,240 --> 00:42:29,760
those areas nowhere else like i'm not

1003
00:42:29,760 --> 00:42:31,520
not interested at all

1004
00:42:31,520 --> 00:42:32,560
um

1005
00:42:32,560 --> 00:42:34,800
i don't care what i see that's like

1006
00:42:34,800 --> 00:42:37,680
these areas are highly highly optimal

1007
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:41,200
like you know the areas that you want to

1008
00:42:41,200 --> 00:42:42,000
um

1009
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:45,839
wait hold on i think this is here

1010
00:42:47,280 --> 00:42:49,280
yeah the these are the areas that that

1011
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:51,200
are highly optimal like the areas that

1012
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:53,359
you want to make sure that

1013
00:42:53,359 --> 00:42:56,480
um you trade to and from because

1014
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,880
they often give you that that chance of

1015
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:01,440
redemption if you are wrong

1016
00:43:01,440 --> 00:43:03,119
rather than just chasing like some

1017
00:43:03,119 --> 00:43:05,520
people see this huge push up

1018
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,720
and then they run and and they chase it

1019
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:10,480
you know and they want to get in going

1020
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:12,960
there and then the market just moves

1021
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:15,200
back on them this way and they end up in

1022
00:43:15,200 --> 00:43:17,200
drawdown and they get out

1023
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:18,560
and then like i said they get in the

1024
00:43:18,560 --> 00:43:20,720
cell

1025
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,800
and then it starts to

1026
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,880
log

1027
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,720
when they now they cut two trades in a

1028
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:28,319
loss

1029
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,000
and then they wanted to see it go up a

1030
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,920
little more and they started to see it

1031
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:33,599
push up a little more

1032
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:35,920
and then they got into a long and then

1033
00:43:35,920 --> 00:43:37,839
it tapped an area that they did not

1034
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:40,000
recognize or know that it would probably

1035
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,400
react from and then it starts selling

1036
00:43:42,400 --> 00:43:43,680
and

1037
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:46,079
three trades in a row like you're just

1038
00:43:46,079 --> 00:43:48,560
out that fast account blown whatever it

1039
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:51,280
is like happen that fast

1040
00:43:51,280 --> 00:43:53,359
because of your impulses

1041
00:43:53,359 --> 00:43:54,960
and that's how people are i'm you guys

1042
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,319
didn't make me finish my coffee

1043
00:43:56,319 --> 00:43:59,119
unacceptable

1044
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,160
see look you see how you had this bounce

1045
00:44:06,160 --> 00:44:08,720
on this area now with this i will say

1046
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:09,920
that

1047
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,599
this is why i go down to the lower time

1048
00:44:11,599 --> 00:44:12,560
frames

1049
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:14,800
because on the lower time frames

1050
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:17,359
with these areas they actually start to

1051
00:44:17,359 --> 00:44:21,760
just move up a bit like you'll see that

1052
00:44:21,760 --> 00:44:24,240
on a lower time frame might actually be

1053
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:26,480
like 804

1054
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:27,280
but

1055
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:30,960
because it's from the higher time frame

1056
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:33,680
um the the wicks that are used on the

1057
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:35,839
higher time frame are often bodies on

1058
00:44:35,839 --> 00:44:38,240
the lower time frame so the bodies would

1059
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:40,319
get me more accuracy

1060
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:41,119
than

1061
00:44:41,119 --> 00:44:42,240
the um

1062
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:44,560
the actual wicks would

1063
00:44:44,560 --> 00:44:47,680
and this is why you know with this these

1064
00:44:47,680 --> 00:44:49,520
are just areas

1065
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:51,200
that you're looking for things to happen

1066
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:53,520
and not necessarily the touch of the

1067
00:44:53,520 --> 00:44:55,680
line but if i find it on a one minute

1068
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:58,960
then yes it's the touch of the line

1069
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,640
let's see did this

1070
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:02,480
nope

1071
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:04,960
it wasn't there so oftentimes

1072
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:07,200
the first you you'll see you'll see

1073
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:09,119
three different types of reactions

1074
00:45:09,119 --> 00:45:10,720
within these zones let me actually say

1075
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,160
this um

1076
00:45:12,160 --> 00:45:13,680
i think this would be good for for

1077
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:15,760
people trading you see three different

1078
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,440
types of reactions within these zones

1079
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:23,359
the first one being hold on

1080
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:26,480
the first one usually

1081
00:45:26,480 --> 00:45:29,920
usually is um let me actually move this

1082
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:32,400
the first one usually is

1083
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:35,680
the tap of

1084
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:39,280
the smd zone

1085
00:45:40,560 --> 00:45:43,040
oftentimes you get a tap or you come

1086
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:45,760
close to it and then like super close

1087
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:47,040
i'm talking about like a pip or

1088
00:45:47,040 --> 00:45:49,040
something close and then you trade away

1089
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:50,480
from it

1090
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:52,480
so you either get the top or or just

1091
00:45:52,480 --> 00:45:54,880
like just below it but most times it's

1092
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:57,119
it's the top usually get a rejection on

1093
00:45:57,119 --> 00:45:59,040
the top

1094
00:45:59,040 --> 00:46:00,800
usually the there's a there's a

1095
00:46:00,800 --> 00:46:03,119
rejection right and this is why i say

1096
00:46:03,119 --> 00:46:04,800
targets can be

1097
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:06,960
you know um yeah it's it's the midway

1098
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:08,720
most times when you're taking that trade

1099
00:46:08,720 --> 00:46:10,240
at a distance

1100
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,119
but

1101
00:46:11,119 --> 00:46:13,680
targets can actually be

1102
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:14,400
just

1103
00:46:14,400 --> 00:46:17,040
the bottom of the zone first

1104
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:19,200
that's the first target

1105
00:46:19,200 --> 00:46:21,040
if you want to partial out whatever it

1106
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:24,560
is you can do that on just the bottom of

1107
00:46:24,560 --> 00:46:27,599
the area alone the second area that's

1108
00:46:27,599 --> 00:46:29,040
usually hit

1109
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,839
is the middle of the area

1110
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:34,560
so when you grab this area you take the

1111
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:36,240
middle of it sometimes it could even be

1112
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:38,480
like the 60 70 percent

1113
00:46:38,480 --> 00:46:40,240
you take that area i'm talking about

1114
00:46:40,240 --> 00:46:41,359
just just

1115
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:43,440
maybe the middle at least the middle and

1116
00:46:43,440 --> 00:46:45,680
above consider that

1117
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:48,560
and that's the second type of touch

1118
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:50,000
that you can get

1119
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:52,160
where it taps into this area and trades

1120
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:53,359
away

1121
00:46:53,359 --> 00:46:55,359
the third one that you can get

1122
00:46:55,359 --> 00:46:58,720
is that price can actually

1123
00:46:58,720 --> 00:47:02,960
just wick up above the area it can still

1124
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:05,040
go above this area

1125
00:47:05,040 --> 00:47:06,319
and then

1126
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:08,720
it doesn't close up there it immediately

1127
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:12,240
starts to go down that is absorption

1128
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,079
slim what's up how's everything man good

1129
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,240
to see you brother

1130
00:47:16,240 --> 00:47:18,160
my face always lights up when you come

1131
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,079
in how you doing man

1132
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,359
lately i haven't been able to follow

1133
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,119
your live streams

1134
00:47:23,119 --> 00:47:24,480
uh your live show

1135
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:26,240
too much because of work

1136
00:47:26,240 --> 00:47:29,520
yes yes exactly yeah

1137
00:47:29,520 --> 00:47:32,319
you what soon has probably been since i

1138
00:47:32,319 --> 00:47:34,880
resigned you resigned slim

1139
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:38,319
oh my gosh i'm happy that you you uh

1140
00:47:38,319 --> 00:47:42,160
chose yourself i'm happy about that

1141
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:43,119
so

1142
00:47:43,119 --> 00:47:46,079
yeah hold on john um for me i like to

1143
00:47:46,079 --> 00:47:47,280
zoom in

1144
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:49,280
one minute to be more accurate exactly i

1145
00:47:49,280 --> 00:47:50,960
like to zoom in and be more accurate on

1146
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:52,880
one minute two john that's exactly it

1147
00:47:52,880 --> 00:47:56,720
like it it helps with accuracy you know

1148
00:47:56,720 --> 00:47:58,880
when you come to the lower time frames

1149
00:47:58,880 --> 00:48:02,880
now you can refine too much sometimes

1150
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,200
and when you refine too much what could

1151
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:07,200
eventually happen is that

1152
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:10,160
you miss certain moves when you're

1153
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:12,640
refining so low so you want to make sure

1154
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:15,040
that your refinement stays usually i go

1155
00:48:15,040 --> 00:48:17,119
all the way down to the 15 when i'm

1156
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:19,200
doing the top down and then i'll move

1157
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:22,240
forward with trading just from the 15.

1158
00:48:22,240 --> 00:48:23,040
so

1159
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:25,119
i usually refine to the 15 and then come

1160
00:48:25,119 --> 00:48:27,839
down to the one for entries but anything

1161
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:30,000
on the one like using the one minute s d

1162
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:32,640
zones to trade long from or short from

1163
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,240
you know for quite a distance you don't

1164
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:36,480
want to do that um unless you have a

1165
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,520
higher time frame bias that exceeds it

1166
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,359
like let me show you last night i took a

1167
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:43,200
trade on um

1168
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,960
uh gj

1169
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:46,400
um

1170
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,839
let me see where is it

1171
00:48:51,200 --> 00:48:53,119
i know i took this trade last night

1172
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:55,440
better show up

1173
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:57,119
oh right here right here yeah yeah this

1174
00:48:57,119 --> 00:48:58,079
is it

1175
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:00,400
yeah

1176
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,760
wait was this it it was on the 15 minute

1177
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,160
i think

1178
00:49:08,559 --> 00:49:10,640
and i took this trade like like not even

1179
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,280
following my rules

1180
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:15,359
let's see yeah

1181
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:18,160
so um

1182
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:22,559
i saw price falling out of here

1183
00:49:22,559 --> 00:49:26,000
it was like like on on this particular

1184
00:49:26,000 --> 00:49:26,880
um

1185
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:29,440
you know area here i saw a price falling

1186
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:31,599
down this candle opened

1187
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:34,720
and i was like um

1188
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:36,559
yeah it was this candle that opened and

1189
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,640
i was like you know what

1190
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,240
you know it looks like it's going to tap

1191
00:49:40,240 --> 00:49:43,359
onto this area that's down here because

1192
00:49:43,359 --> 00:49:46,480
you know um it was an unmitigated area

1193
00:49:46,480 --> 00:49:47,680
so i said

1194
00:49:47,680 --> 00:49:49,440
maybe i should just take a short

1195
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:51,599
directly to this

1196
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:53,920
no wasn't this

1197
00:49:53,920 --> 00:49:56,960
i'm tripping like highly

1198
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,800
that was another thing that i had it was

1199
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,960
it was up here look at look at me acting

1200
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,800
a fool explaining that was a real

1201
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:04,160
explanation for that trade by the way

1202
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:07,760
but that was not last night's trade

1203
00:50:09,119 --> 00:50:13,119
so okay it was here yeah yeah it was it

1204
00:50:13,440 --> 00:50:15,920
so um i went to the 15 minute and i took

1205
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:18,640
this area right here this entire area

1206
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,440
here

1207
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:20,880
and i said um

1208
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:22,559
price can potentially come down and tap

1209
00:50:22,559 --> 00:50:25,200
into this area but i was kind of looking

1210
00:50:25,200 --> 00:50:28,160
for um

1211
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:32,960
if you look up here

1212
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:42,079
yeah price was falling out of

1213
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:44,800
this right here this is what it was it

1214
00:50:44,800 --> 00:50:47,599
was right up here it was risky risky by

1215
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:49,280
the way because i'm getting in into the

1216
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:51,520
middle of an area but since i saw on the

1217
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:54,240
15 minute that it was potentially coming

1218
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:55,520
down to here

1219
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:57,839
i went with the 15 minute bias and i

1220
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:00,960
actually just short it from here

1221
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:03,520
now i would not recommend

1222
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:05,119
anyone

1223
00:51:05,119 --> 00:51:07,280
just shorting because they know it's

1224
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:09,599
going to an area or longing because they

1225
00:51:09,599 --> 00:51:11,599
know it's going to an area so i had a

1226
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:13,200
short here and we were playing around

1227
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,800
with in this area and i was like let me

1228
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:16,640
just go to bed you know and i'll just

1229
00:51:16,640 --> 00:51:18,720
wait for price to to tap down here so i

1230
00:51:18,720 --> 00:51:21,040
woke up this morning and it actually

1231
00:51:21,040 --> 00:51:23,920
tapped um in this area and it was a very

1232
00:51:23,920 --> 00:51:25,680
small lot size that i took on this trade

1233
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:27,040
i just wanted to

1234
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:28,559
wake up to the satisfaction of being

1235
00:51:28,559 --> 00:51:29,839
right so

1236
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:30,960
you know i

1237
00:51:30,960 --> 00:51:32,720
was able to just jump in on a quick

1238
00:51:32,720 --> 00:51:36,240
short you know up in this area um and i

1239
00:51:36,240 --> 00:51:38,160
saw all of these areas down here and of

1240
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,400
course you you got little reactions from

1241
00:51:40,400 --> 00:51:43,040
these areas even this one here you know

1242
00:51:43,040 --> 00:51:44,800
this one might have scared people and

1243
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:47,040
been like oh you know it's pushing up

1244
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:49,599
it's about to flip in reverse but

1245
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,880
the higher time frame is always king so

1246
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:54,800
um i actually

1247
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:56,000
um

1248
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:58,640
stuck with a higher time frame bias um i

1249
00:51:58,640 --> 00:52:01,040
was probably already asleep somewhere

1250
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:03,119
around oh yeah yeah it was it was moving

1251
00:52:03,119 --> 00:52:05,200
up here that's right so it was already

1252
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:07,680
heading to sleep around this area um and

1253
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,599
then price still came right down and

1254
00:52:09,599 --> 00:52:12,240
tapped into this but i always say that

1255
00:52:12,240 --> 00:52:13,680
you know

1256
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:15,760
you got to make sure that when it taps

1257
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,200
your area you want to see if it's

1258
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,440
flipping bullish if it's not you could

1259
00:52:19,440 --> 00:52:21,119
stay in because look at where this

1260
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:23,599
ultimately went

1261
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,440
down here

1262
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:26,640
so

1263
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:28,960
from from a little trade that looks like

1264
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:32,559
you know let me catch a ride to you know

1265
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:33,440
like

1266
00:52:33,440 --> 00:52:36,240
what the absolute heck

1267
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,680
is going on here you know like

1268
00:52:39,680 --> 00:52:41,359
like this is

1269
00:52:41,359 --> 00:52:43,119
this is crazy you just jumped in on a

1270
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:45,040
little scalp and it just happened to so

1271
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,480
you want to always make sure that the

1272
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:48,559
time frame that you're trading from

1273
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:51,520
you begin to see a bullish flip

1274
00:52:51,520 --> 00:52:53,760
within that time frame

1275
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,760
and if you don't see the flip on that

1276
00:52:55,760 --> 00:52:57,520
higher time frame

1277
00:52:57,520 --> 00:53:00,160
then you're not getting out so if you go

1278
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:03,760
to the 15 minute here

1279
00:53:05,280 --> 00:53:07,440
this is the area that we said price was

1280
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,079
coming down to

1281
00:53:10,079 --> 00:53:12,559
right here

1282
00:53:13,040 --> 00:53:14,800
did we get a flip around here when we

1283
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,440
tapped here we tapped into it went up

1284
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:18,640
tapped into

1285
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:21,359
the next area and then left

1286
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,200
didn't even give us like any other

1287
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,359
movement around here just began to shore

1288
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:28,800
after tapping into the next area so on

1289
00:53:28,800 --> 00:53:30,960
this time frame

1290
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:33,520
we didn't get any indication

1291
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,480
that price wanted to flip bullish until

1292
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:38,559
you know possibly somewhere down in this

1293
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:39,520
area

1294
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:42,079
and when you have that like huge push

1295
00:53:42,079 --> 00:53:44,319
out of the area i i talked to you about

1296
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:47,680
like the the v-shape recovery so now you

1297
00:53:47,680 --> 00:53:49,680
could have it to where price taps up

1298
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:51,599
into this area here

1299
00:53:51,599 --> 00:53:54,880
and comes back down into an area

1300
00:53:54,880 --> 00:53:56,880
somewhere below here

1301
00:53:56,880 --> 00:53:59,599
whether it's this area here

1302
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:01,520
or this area here

1303
00:54:01,520 --> 00:54:03,920
it could potentially just run this high

1304
00:54:03,920 --> 00:54:06,720
tap into this area and then swing back

1305
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:09,280
down into this area before

1306
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:11,119
trading higher

1307
00:54:11,119 --> 00:54:13,760
or when it's coming down from from up

1308
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,240
here it can just go straight down here

1309
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,839
like run the low that could happen too

1310
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,480
you know that's a possibility

1311
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,720
because this is the last high

1312
00:54:24,720 --> 00:54:28,240
um that was put in so if this high is

1313
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:30,640
ran then it flips bullish on this time

1314
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:32,079
frame

1315
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,480
you know but again it can just come tap

1316
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:36,960
back up into this area

1317
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:39,359
and and find the smd that's responsible

1318
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:42,559
for the break of structure which is this

1319
00:54:42,559 --> 00:54:44,720
one here

1320
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:47,520
you know it was this one um as well you

1321
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:49,200
see price came up tapped into it and

1322
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:51,280
went further but now it pushed through

1323
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,599
that area um so this is another area

1324
00:54:53,599 --> 00:54:55,359
that it can give a reaction to like i

1325
00:54:55,359 --> 00:54:58,000
said it can go back down to this area

1326
00:54:58,000 --> 00:55:00,240
here

1327
00:55:00,799 --> 00:55:01,839
and then

1328
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:04,319
come out of the area and trade further

1329
00:55:04,319 --> 00:55:06,559
to run the highs if

1330
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:08,319
it's going to do that

1331
00:55:08,319 --> 00:55:10,079
you know it would do it within that

1332
00:55:10,079 --> 00:55:11,440
sequence

1333
00:55:11,440 --> 00:55:14,000
you know so um

1334
00:55:14,000 --> 00:55:15,920
if anybody trades this i would i would

1335
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:18,240
you know look to get involved with that

1336
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,480
but you want to see a flip with that if

1337
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,119
you were in from up here and this pushed

1338
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:24,799
into this area

1339
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:27,200
and went back short again

1340
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:28,720
you know that's fine i mean granted you

1341
00:55:28,720 --> 00:55:30,160
should have took profit down here or

1342
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:32,559
somewhere within one of these areas but

1343
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,960
you know like if you were within within

1344
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,599
this area then you're just watching all

1345
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:40,240
of this happen you want to see a flip on

1346
00:55:40,240 --> 00:55:42,640
your time frame that you're shorting

1347
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,440
from to know whether you should get out

1348
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:46,559
or not

1349
00:55:46,559 --> 00:55:48,880
and that's what some of this you know

1350
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,720
would essentially show you so you put in

1351
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:51,920
this low

1352
00:55:51,920 --> 00:55:54,000
you put in this high

1353
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:55,839
you put in another low

1354
00:55:55,839 --> 00:55:57,520
and then you run that high so what do we

1355
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,839
usually say when that high is ran we

1356
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:02,240
come back into the area before trading

1357
00:56:02,240 --> 00:56:03,680
long

1358
00:56:03,680 --> 00:56:05,920
so if anybody was in this trade from up

1359
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,319
here and they happen to come down here

1360
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:11,040
but miss the area to take profit in and

1361
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:13,440
it comes back to this area there's a

1362
00:56:13,440 --> 00:56:15,839
possibility that it comes back into this

1363
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:16,720
area

1364
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:18,559
and they could still maintain some of

1365
00:56:18,559 --> 00:56:21,680
their profit or they can just they could

1366
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:24,240
have just gotten out in profit waited

1367
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:26,480
until it came back up into this area and

1368
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,240
then potentially

1369
00:56:28,240 --> 00:56:30,960
short it back down to recover the profit

1370
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:32,480
that they lost and this is all from the

1371
00:56:32,480 --> 00:56:34,240
15 minute time frame

1372
00:56:34,240 --> 00:56:35,599
you know so

1373
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,720
it's finding the higher time frame bias

1374
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:40,640
and going with that

1375
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:42,400
um let me actually go back to the chart

1376
00:56:42,400 --> 00:56:44,400
that i was using um

1377
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,640
i have until september 2nd last day of

1378
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,200
work to become extra profitable

1379
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:51,280
well we're going to have some uh

1380
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,760
some some live trading

1381
00:56:53,760 --> 00:56:55,839
um some uh

1382
00:56:55,839 --> 00:56:56,720
zoom

1383
00:56:56,720 --> 00:56:58,799
you know trading i'm i'm gonna you'll

1384
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,119
probably select a few people that

1385
00:57:01,119 --> 00:57:03,040
you know feel like is is really

1386
00:57:03,040 --> 00:57:05,280
understanding and getting the concepts

1387
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:07,200
and i'm gonna like teach them everything

1388
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:09,440
i know in his totality

1389
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,559
um so you guys can get out there and and

1390
00:57:12,559 --> 00:57:15,119
stream and and get like mass produce

1391
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,200
this information get it out there for

1392
00:57:17,200 --> 00:57:19,680
everyone to to be able to

1393
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:23,520
um particularly learn from

1394
00:57:23,520 --> 00:57:27,680
so you see we get the tap on the area

1395
00:57:27,680 --> 00:57:29,920
then we run the middle of the area

1396
00:57:29,920 --> 00:57:31,760
you know because it's actually it's

1397
00:57:31,760 --> 00:57:34,160
actually this area here if if i'm being

1398
00:57:34,160 --> 00:57:36,000
honest

1399
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:38,000
yeah this area

1400
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:41,040
but we tap into the middle of the area

1401
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:42,799
and then we trade out

1402
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:44,480
and then now potentially we could run

1403
00:57:44,480 --> 00:57:47,280
the area too come up into the one that's

1404
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,240
directly above

1405
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:51,839
here

1406
00:57:51,839 --> 00:57:54,160
and then what can we do start the whole

1407
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:57,599
madness over again tap into the area

1408
00:57:57,599 --> 00:58:00,000
first at the tip of the area come back

1409
00:58:00,000 --> 00:58:02,240
down into this area

1410
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:04,319
you know here

1411
00:58:04,319 --> 00:58:06,559
and then come back up and tap into like

1412
00:58:06,559 --> 00:58:08,400
the middle i told you it's anywhere from

1413
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,799
the middle to like the the 90

1414
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:11,920
often

1415
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,559
tap back into that area

1416
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:16,400
come back from that area back into an

1417
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:18,400
area here like this is literally how

1418
00:58:18,400 --> 00:58:19,839
price can move

1419
00:58:19,839 --> 00:58:21,920
you know just just using these areas

1420
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:24,400
like this is how it often moves

1421
00:58:24,400 --> 00:58:25,440

thanks walter i'll definitely be sure to

um to add you in there and again you

1508
01:01:30,480 --> 01:01:32,160
guys can reach out to me for anything i

1509
01:01:32,160 --> 01:01:35,200
love analyzing charts us 30 gold

1510
01:01:35,200 --> 01:01:37,040
whatever it is it doesn't matter

1511
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:38,799
anything i love

1512
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:41,440
just being able to analyze whatever it

1513
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:43,440
is that that i'm looking at i'm actually

1514
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,440
in love with charting so

1515
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:47,599
you know you you guys will definitely

1516
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:49,200
benefit from that

1517
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:50,720
so you see how we got the rejection in

1518
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,960
the middle of this area guys

1519
01:01:52,960 --> 01:01:54,799
you know i talked about

1520
01:01:54,799 --> 01:01:57,280
how we get different types of rejections

1521
01:01:57,280 --> 01:01:59,920
you know we get the midpoint of it

1522
01:01:59,920 --> 01:02:02,240
oftentimes we'll get the touch of it and

1523
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:04,079
then sometimes we'll get the push right

1524
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:05,599
through the area but it's not

1525
01:02:05,599 --> 01:02:08,079
necessarily the candle closure so

1526
01:02:08,079 --> 01:02:11,599
this is a supply area with this wick yes

1527
01:02:11,599 --> 01:02:13,599
but you also have

1528
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:17,039
this area here too

1529
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:20,079
this area is a supply area also you know

1530
01:02:20,079 --> 01:02:21,599
so you have one right in front of the

1531
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:23,280
other this might have mitigated it just

1532
01:02:23,280 --> 01:02:26,000
a little bit but i kind of like to see

1533
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:29,200
mitigations of at least like 50 60 or

1534
01:02:29,200 --> 01:02:30,000
more

1535
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:32,640
to to like judge whether

1536
01:02:32,640 --> 01:02:35,599
like this is this is an area that has

1537
01:02:35,599 --> 01:02:37,839
mitigation already and there's there's

1538
01:02:37,839 --> 01:02:40,319
no reaction that's going to come from it

1539
01:02:40,319 --> 01:02:43,359
so i pretty much like the the the 50 of

1540
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:44,559
this area

1541
01:02:44,559 --> 01:02:46,079
i like to see that but if anything it'll

1542
01:02:46,079 --> 01:02:49,200
come back up to possibly this area above

1543
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,319
here you have another area right here

1544
01:02:52,319 --> 01:02:54,319
and again these these are targets as

1545
01:02:54,319 --> 01:02:57,280
well to trade too

1546
01:02:57,280 --> 01:02:59,119
you know if you're in from any of the

1547
01:02:59,119 --> 01:03:01,359
moves down here like this was a great i

1548
01:03:01,359 --> 01:03:03,200
mean i i teach this all the time on this

1549
01:03:03,200 --> 01:03:04,799
channel but i talk about these little

1550
01:03:04,799 --> 01:03:05,839
flips

1551
01:03:05,839 --> 01:03:07,599
you know you have price coming to this

1552
01:03:07,599 --> 01:03:08,799
area

1553
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,160
let me show you guys real quick

1554
01:03:13,039 --> 01:03:15,280
so you have this low pudding

1555
01:03:15,280 --> 01:03:16,799
you have this high put in you have price

1556
01:03:16,799 --> 01:03:19,680
come into this area and we flip out of

1557
01:03:19,680 --> 01:03:22,319
this area here

1558
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:24,400
so what does price do come back down

1559
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:26,319
into this area i told you it can come in

1560
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:29,520
all the way to like the 90 sometimes

1561
01:03:29,520 --> 01:03:30,880
and then

1562
01:03:30,880 --> 01:03:33,440
lungs out of the area to to an area

1563
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,200
above let me get rid of this sorry about

1564
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:37,359
that

1565
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:40,079
yeah then it longs to an area right here

1566
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:43,280
so all you do is

1567
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,039
take the area left behind

1568
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,359
right here

1569
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:51,039
and you're looking

1570
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:53,280
for sorry it's not here it's it's this

1571
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:54,960
actually i'm tripping sorry about that

1572
01:03:54,960 --> 01:03:58,240
guys take the area that's left behind

1573
01:03:58,240 --> 01:04:00,480
right here

1574
01:04:00,480 --> 01:04:02,400
the area when it flips up take the area

1575
01:04:02,400 --> 01:04:04,000
that's left behind

1576
01:04:04,000 --> 01:04:06,000
and all you do is look for it to tap

1577
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,520
into the area

1578
01:04:07,520 --> 01:04:09,760
and then take you out of the area and a

1579
01:04:09,760 --> 01:04:11,520
lot of the times what people tend to do

1580
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:15,119
is the candle this is the red the the

1581
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:17,760
bearish candle the bearish candle that

1582
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:19,839
goes into the area

1583
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:23,119
if you place a buy stop or buy limit

1584
01:04:23,119 --> 01:04:25,680
just above it

1585
01:04:25,680 --> 01:04:28,960
like here the momentum your your stops

1586
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:31,520
would be like behind the the candle that

1587
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,480
went into the area the momentum when

1588
01:04:34,480 --> 01:04:37,280
it's leaving the area can take you out

1589
01:04:37,280 --> 01:04:39,039
of that area

1590
01:04:39,039 --> 01:04:41,599
but if this bearish candle continues to

1591
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:43,440
go down

1592
01:04:43,440 --> 01:04:45,839
you can just cancel the buy stop or the

1593
01:04:45,839 --> 01:04:47,599
sell stop

1594
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:50,400
so now you you don't even have to bother

1595
01:04:50,400 --> 01:04:53,440
you know utilizing the the um

1596
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,359
the buy stop or sell stop because price

1597
01:04:55,359 --> 01:04:57,839
is still melting through the area

1598
01:04:57,839 --> 01:04:59,359
and you would just realize that that was

1599
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:00,799
an area that price was not going to

1600
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:03,599
trade above so you could utilize that

1601
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:06,640
she is a nicholas you you utilize that

1602
01:05:06,640 --> 01:05:08,960
to be able to um

1603
01:05:08,960 --> 01:05:10,799
you know get out of certain trades that

1604
01:05:10,799 --> 01:05:13,200
like this is if if you were in this

1605
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:16,000
trade right here

1606
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:18,400
and you placed you know your your order

1607
01:05:18,400 --> 01:05:20,160
here stops behind here

1608
01:05:20,160 --> 01:05:21,839
and you targeted you know you're

1609
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:23,520
targeting whatever above it could even

1610
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:26,400
be you know this particular area up here

1611
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,319
you know possibility for price to come

1612
01:05:28,319 --> 01:05:30,799
to this area but this was the area that

1613
01:05:30,799 --> 01:05:32,559
i had mentioned that broke structure to

1614
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:35,200
the downside so oftentimes this area

1615
01:05:35,200 --> 01:05:36,799
tends to be a little more

1616
01:05:36,799 --> 01:05:38,960
um have a little more importance

1617
01:05:38,960 --> 01:05:40,799
um than

1618
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:42,960
you know any of the other areas because

1619
01:05:42,960 --> 01:05:44,880
it's the area that actually broke

1620
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,680
structure now although this may be very

1621
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,480
small you could still have a possibility

1622
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,559
of making it up to this before it

1623
01:05:52,559 --> 01:05:53,839
rejects

1624
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,640
back down you know to here so it's a

1625
01:05:56,640 --> 01:05:58,000
possibility

1626
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:00,480
you know but yeah the these these little

1627
01:06:00,480 --> 01:06:03,359
techniques kind of keep you out of

1628
01:06:03,359 --> 01:06:06,160
you know being able to like like being

1629
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:08,559
in losing trades you know it can cut it

1630
01:06:08,559 --> 01:06:11,280
down by like half you know just just

1631
01:06:11,280 --> 01:06:13,039
waiting for the candle that goes down

1632
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:14,319
into the area

1633
01:06:14,319 --> 01:06:15,359
and then

1634
01:06:15,359 --> 01:06:17,760
having the push out of the area and you

1635
01:06:17,760 --> 01:06:20,160
get in on the momentum of the push out

1636
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:21,359
of the area

1637
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,039
rather than catching the falling knife

1638
01:06:23,039 --> 01:06:25,039
here because if this continues to go

1639
01:06:25,039 --> 01:06:26,559
down it just hits your stop loss you're

1640
01:06:26,559 --> 01:06:27,760
out

1641
01:06:27,760 --> 01:06:28,480
but

1642
01:06:28,480 --> 01:06:31,680
if you had put it above here yes it can

1643
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,520
take you in and still come back for your

1644
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,599
stop-loss and take you out yeah that's

1645
01:06:35,599 --> 01:06:37,599
true too and you're risking a little

1646
01:06:37,599 --> 01:06:39,680
more with this too because you see how

1647
01:06:39,680 --> 01:06:42,000
your stop-loss is 32 pips here versus

1648
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:45,920
your stop being only 16 pips here so

1649
01:06:45,920 --> 01:06:47,920
there's there's more risk on a table

1650
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:50,640
which would result in a lower lot size

1651
01:06:50,640 --> 01:06:53,520
but often times you know like if you're

1652
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:56,079
right you have this momentum pushing out

1653
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:59,680
of this area to the next possible area

1654
01:06:59,680 --> 01:07:02,559
you know that if it ran down into this

1655
01:07:02,559 --> 01:07:05,119
area and pushed back up out of the area

1656
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:06,799
we could have a little resistance in

1657
01:07:06,799 --> 01:07:09,359
this s and d zone above here actually no

1658
01:07:09,359 --> 01:07:12,079
this is not i this is a line i drew

1659
01:07:12,079 --> 01:07:15,680
yeah so no um you know within this area

1660
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:17,359
you see that if it pushed out of this

1661
01:07:17,359 --> 01:07:19,359
area and took this high then you know

1662
01:07:19,359 --> 01:07:21,119
it's going to trade back up above why

1663
01:07:21,119 --> 01:07:23,599
because there's mitigation

1664
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:25,680
within these areas

1665
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:28,319
all this is mitigated so at the your

1666
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:30,319
target at least

1667
01:07:30,319 --> 01:07:32,240
could have been this high or even this

1668
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:34,480
high because this mitigated this so you

1669
01:07:34,480 --> 01:07:36,799
take it at least been this high

1670
01:07:36,799 --> 01:07:40,400
or potentially up to the midway of this

1671
01:07:40,400 --> 01:07:41,359
s

1672
01:07:41,359 --> 01:07:43,680
or to this s and d here and see how we

1673
01:07:43,680 --> 01:07:46,480
just ran the high of this snd did a body

1674
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:48,079
close above

1675
01:07:48,079 --> 01:07:50,799
uh yes it did so we could potentially

1676
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:52,400
just be having a

1677
01:07:52,400 --> 01:07:54,720
rejection from this area

1678
01:07:54,720 --> 01:07:56,559
tap back into

1679
01:07:56,559 --> 01:07:59,680
you know some other area below here

1680
01:07:59,680 --> 01:08:02,079
this is mitigated

1681
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,000
uh

1682
01:08:04,000 --> 01:08:06,799
yeah this is mitigated

1683
01:08:06,799 --> 01:08:08,559
this doesn't have mitigation you can see

1684
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:10,640
some resistance down into this area but

1685
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:13,039
then there's an imbalance between here

1686
01:08:13,039 --> 01:08:15,440
and here so watch that there could be a

1687
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:18,560
reaction back into this area here

1688
01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,799
um but if

1689
01:08:20,799 --> 01:08:23,520
if it goes through this area then

1690
01:08:23,520 --> 01:08:26,158
i see it probably going here

1691
01:08:26,158 --> 01:08:28,319
and if it doesn't go here

1692
01:08:28,319 --> 01:08:30,000
then it looks like all of this is

1693
01:08:30,000 --> 01:08:32,238
already mitigated so um

1694
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:33,759
you could potentially have it to where

1695
01:08:33,759 --> 01:08:35,759
it runs the low if it doesn't stop

1696
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:39,040
through any of these areas uh here

1697
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:41,359
so you you get this resistance here

1698
01:08:41,359 --> 01:08:43,520
because of this fractal

1699
01:08:43,520 --> 01:08:46,080
that's here

1700
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:48,640
let me show you guys

1701
01:08:48,640 --> 01:08:51,880
this fractal

1702
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:54,640
this

1703
01:08:54,640 --> 01:08:57,520
wick that went up price

1704
01:08:57,520 --> 01:08:59,679
opened up on the next candle and then it

1705
01:08:59,679 --> 01:09:02,000
went down so this is a

1706
01:09:02,000 --> 01:09:04,960
this pushed up and this created a down

1707
01:09:04,960 --> 01:09:07,839
move and then went up

1708
01:09:07,839 --> 01:09:10,960
so this essentially is like a

1709
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,279
you know hidden area where there's a

1710
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,839
demand below and that's for that goes

1711
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,839
for all of these fractals

1712
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:20,399
all of these fractals can be demand

1713
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:23,520
areas below or supply areas above so you

1714
01:09:23,520 --> 01:09:27,359
can have price react off of the fractal

1715
01:09:27,359 --> 01:09:29,759
alone like here's another fractal here

1716
01:09:29,759 --> 01:09:32,399
now they don't hold as strong as the

1717
01:09:32,399 --> 01:09:35,600
full body snd zones you know but you

1718
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,679
still get some type of reaction from

1719
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:39,520
them sometimes you know so here's

1720
01:09:39,520 --> 01:09:41,679
another fractal here wick down wick

1721
01:09:41,679 --> 01:09:43,679
above and then there's another fractal

1722
01:09:43,679 --> 01:09:45,520
within this area here

1723
01:09:45,520 --> 01:09:46,799
and this is why i was saying that if it

1724
01:09:46,799 --> 01:09:49,120
doesn't hold it at any of these areas

1725
01:09:49,120 --> 01:09:50,960
then it could potentially look to run

1726
01:09:50,960 --> 01:09:53,839
the lows into this area because there's

1727
01:09:53,839 --> 01:09:55,120
mitigation here already there's

1728
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,040
mitigation here already

1729
01:09:57,040 --> 01:09:58,960
there's this fractal this fractal and

1730
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:00,960
this fractal let me actually move this

1731
01:10:00,960 --> 01:10:02,480
um

1732
01:10:02,480 --> 01:10:05,199
out the way

1733
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:08,000
uh

1734
01:10:08,000 --> 01:10:11,520
yeah i gotta do better with um

1735
01:10:12,480 --> 01:10:16,760
with messing my charts up

1736
01:10:17,199 --> 01:10:20,960
uh let's see so look even here

1737
01:10:20,960 --> 01:10:22,800
this is this is what i try to explain

1738
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:24,159
most times

1739
01:10:24,159 --> 01:10:26,239
to you guys you have this low you have

1740
01:10:26,239 --> 01:10:28,719
this high put in you have this low you

1741
01:10:28,719 --> 01:10:30,880
have this high put in slightly higher

1742
01:10:30,880 --> 01:10:32,880
than this but it's still a high put in

1743
01:10:32,880 --> 01:10:35,040
we run the low what do we do come back

1744
01:10:35,040 --> 01:10:37,760
into the area we came to about 70 80

1745
01:10:37,760 --> 01:10:40,239
percent of this area and then we traded

1746
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:42,960
out of the area

1747
01:10:42,960 --> 01:10:44,640
so if anything

1748
01:10:44,640 --> 01:10:46,800
this could have been just a quick move

1749
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:48,880
down to one of these areas whether it's

1750
01:10:48,880 --> 01:10:50,480
this fractal whether it's going to go to

1751
01:10:50,480 --> 01:10:52,560
this fractal it's a quick move out of

1752
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:54,159
the area and if you understand

1753
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:56,000
candlestick structure

1754
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,640
that makes your trading so much more

1755
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:00,640
powerful let me move this that makes

1756
01:11:00,640 --> 01:11:03,199
your trading so much more powerful with

1757
01:11:03,199 --> 01:11:05,120
candlestick structure because if you if

1758
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:08,080
you look at it um

1759
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:12,280
let's see it's

1760
01:11:12,400 --> 01:11:14,910
and then trade it below it so

1761
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:16,800
[Music]

1762
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:19,040
in terms of candlestick structure it was

1763
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:21,679
this here

1764
01:11:22,320 --> 01:11:24,560
so if you were able to identify this in

1765
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:28,480
real time then

1766
01:11:31,679 --> 01:11:34,080
you would have been able to grab a quick

1767
01:11:34,080 --> 01:11:37,360
1 to 4.6

1768
01:11:37,840 --> 01:11:41,280
quick 46 pips 10 pip stop loss

1769
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:43,280
just noticing this and noticing that the

1770
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,600
next area is potentially this fractal

1771
01:11:47,600 --> 01:11:48,960
that would have been a quick trade out

1772
01:11:48,960 --> 01:11:50,080
of the area

1773
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:52,480
and you know that if there's a

1774
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:54,400
equal high within this area it

1775
01:11:54,400 --> 01:11:56,960
oftentimes results in in the run of the

1776
01:11:56,960 --> 01:11:58,320
low

1777
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,640
if it doesn't hold

1778
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:03,520
within this area here

1779
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:04,560
so

1780
01:12:04,560 --> 01:12:07,280
no knowing candlestick structure can

1781
01:12:07,280 --> 01:12:10,480
teach you that and in my may 13th video

1782
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,480
that's um the video that i actually um

1783
01:12:14,480 --> 01:12:17,280
taught in depth candlestick structure

1784
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,679
um so candlestick structure is is very

1785
01:12:19,679 --> 01:12:22,080
very important when it's around these

1786
01:12:22,080 --> 01:12:24,640
these like the areas of your entry so

1787
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:26,640
you can find your entry just using

1788
01:12:26,640 --> 01:12:28,880
candlestick structure alone

1789
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:30,880
if it gets to a certain area that you're

1790
01:12:30,880 --> 01:12:32,960
looking to trade from you could find

1791
01:12:32,960 --> 01:12:36,159
your entry from candlestick structure

1792
01:12:36,159 --> 01:12:39,600
so with this you have let me show you

1793
01:12:39,600 --> 01:12:41,520
with this you have this low

1794
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,239
you have this high you have this low

1795
01:12:44,239 --> 01:12:46,239
then we run

1796
01:12:46,239 --> 01:12:48,080
the high

1797
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:52,400
so we potentially have an area here

1798
01:12:52,800 --> 01:12:54,400
that has gone

1799
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:57,120
unmitigated

1800
01:12:57,120 --> 01:12:58,880
let me

1801
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:00,960
i don't know why this isn't

1802
01:13:00,960 --> 01:13:03,360
yeah we potentially have an area here

1803
01:13:03,360 --> 01:13:06,719
that's going to unmitigate it

1804
01:13:07,520 --> 01:13:10,880
here now depending on how this candle

1805
01:13:10,880 --> 01:13:12,000
moved

1806
01:13:12,000 --> 01:13:15,120
this could be mitigated because often

1807
01:13:15,120 --> 01:13:17,040
times you have it to where the candle

1808
01:13:17,040 --> 01:13:19,440
will go and break the high first

1809
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:22,239
then come back into the area and then

1810
01:13:22,239 --> 01:13:25,120
push back up and you can't see that in

1811
01:13:25,120 --> 01:13:28,000
in reverse you can see that in in real

1812
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:30,239
time maybe if you use the replay

1813
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,760
function to show

1814
01:13:31,760 --> 01:13:33,360
how it

1815
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:37,120
how it opened up let me see

1816
01:13:37,760 --> 01:13:40,400
yeah you see pushed up and came down

1817
01:13:40,400 --> 01:13:42,719
into the area mitigated the area and

1818
01:13:42,719 --> 01:13:45,120
then left so that's why you have price

1819
01:13:45,120 --> 01:13:47,440
didn't return to this area and continued

1820
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:49,520
to trade up because it already mitigated

1821
01:13:49,520 --> 01:13:50,560
the area

1822
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:52,719
so if you would have saw that and this

1823
01:13:52,719 --> 01:13:54,159
is what i'm talking about like being

1824
01:13:54,159 --> 01:13:55,679
able to spot things in real time and

1825
01:13:55,679 --> 01:13:57,600
quickly if you just saw that in real

1826
01:13:57,600 --> 01:14:00,320
time the move was here the stop was

1827
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:01,920
behind here

1828
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,080
and you're going up to the next

1829
01:14:04,080 --> 01:14:06,320
potential areas that price could

1830
01:14:06,320 --> 01:14:11,040
potentially go to so you have this area

1831
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:16,400
you have this area

1832
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:24,480
and you have

1833
01:14:24,480 --> 01:14:28,760
this area here being

1834
01:14:30,719 --> 01:14:33,600
this area here

1835
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,600
that you could potentially

1836
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:40,280
you know have targets going to

1837
01:14:42,960 --> 01:14:45,520
and you see that this is the last low

1838
01:14:45,520 --> 01:14:47,360
this is the last high

1839
01:14:47,360 --> 01:14:49,520
this is the last low here

1840
01:14:49,520 --> 01:14:52,000
so this area is very very critical

1841
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,400
because we could potentially run this

1842
01:14:54,400 --> 01:14:57,360
high and if we run that high

1843
01:14:57,360 --> 01:14:59,120
where are we looking

1844
01:14:59,120 --> 01:15:01,760
for price to go

1845
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:03,679
we're looking for price to potentially

1846
01:15:03,679 --> 01:15:04,800
go here

1847
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,520
if we run if we run the high

1848
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,560
could potentially tap into this area and

1849
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:12,640
head back down and retrace somewhere

1850
01:15:12,640 --> 01:15:15,040
into an unmitigated area here

1851
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:17,679
but if we get rejected from here

1852
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,360
there's a possibility that this

1853
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,080
rejection from up here is essentially

1854
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:23,280
and i don't even know why i didn't

1855
01:15:23,280 --> 01:15:24,640
mention this to you guys there's an

1856
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:26,800
imbalance right between here

1857
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:28,960
in this area but if we get rejected from

1858
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:30,880
up here and we begin to

1859
01:15:30,880 --> 01:15:33,840
take out some of these lows through here

1860
01:15:33,840 --> 01:15:36,159
then oftentimes what will happen is it

1861
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:38,320
would result in the run of the load

1862
01:15:38,320 --> 01:15:39,199
because

1863
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:44,480
this is a major area up here so you have

1864
01:15:44,640 --> 01:15:48,560
you have this protected low

1865
01:15:49,360 --> 01:15:53,560
you have a protected low here

1866
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:57,280
you have another protected low here

1867
01:15:57,280 --> 01:15:59,600
so with these protected

1868
01:15:59,600 --> 01:16:01,199
highs and lows

1869
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:02,159
um

1870
01:16:02,159 --> 01:16:03,920
one thing that i usually mention to

1871
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,679
people let me actually just move this

1872
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:07,040
over

1873
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,400
one thing that i mentioned to people

1874
01:16:08,400 --> 01:16:10,640
with the protected highs and lows

1875
01:16:10,640 --> 01:16:12,080
is that

1876
01:16:12,080 --> 01:16:14,640
if price ends up running them now this

1877
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:17,040
this is a protected law if price ends up

1878
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,239
running them

1879
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:20,400
then what usually can happen if this

1880
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:22,159
comes down it could potentially have a

1881
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:24,560
reaction at this area here

1882
01:16:24,560 --> 01:16:26,960
all right let me move this sorry

1883
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,640
you could have a reaction at this area

1884
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:30,400
here because this was the s and d that

1885
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:31,199
broke

1886
01:16:31,199 --> 01:16:32,400
um

1887
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:34,400
structure to the upside here

1888
01:16:34,400 --> 01:16:37,280
so um there could be a reaction

1889
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:40,000
within this area

1890
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,320
um

1891
01:16:45,280 --> 01:16:47,040
so with with these protected highs and

1892
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:49,440
lows what happens is

1893
01:16:49,440 --> 01:16:52,239
if price runs these these these are the

1894
01:16:52,239 --> 01:16:54,239
areas where you know

1895
01:16:54,239 --> 01:16:56,719
big money smart money corporations banks

1896
01:16:56,719 --> 01:16:57,920
whatever you want to call them got

1897
01:16:57,920 --> 01:17:00,159
involved and they started to buy price

1898
01:17:00,159 --> 01:17:01,040
up

1899
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,719
into the

1900
01:17:02,719 --> 01:17:04,800
the structural break above

1901
01:17:04,800 --> 01:17:07,199
they started to buy up into here sold

1902
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:09,520
off a bit and then bought up into here

1903
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:11,440
so oftentimes

1904
01:17:11,440 --> 01:17:13,280
these are protected and they're not

1905
01:17:13,280 --> 01:17:16,880
willing to allow price to go under here

1906
01:17:16,880 --> 01:17:18,640
because this is where the stop losses

1907
01:17:18,640 --> 01:17:19,600
are

1908
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:22,800
but oftentimes if they do go below here

1909
01:17:22,800 --> 01:17:24,960
then you'll see that you might have a

1910
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:27,120
retracement up into the area and it'll

1911
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:30,480
continue to shore out of this area so

1912
01:17:30,480 --> 01:17:32,800
you just want to be mindful of of this

1913
01:17:32,800 --> 01:17:35,760
and this looks a little

1914
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:37,920
this looks a little dodgy to me within

1915
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:40,000
this area only because like you have

1916
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,920
this huge selling off but then you have

1917
01:17:41,920 --> 01:17:44,080
some buying and then quick selling into

1918
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:46,080
it and then we buy up and then we

1919
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:48,960
quickly sell so this whole area here

1920
01:17:48,960 --> 01:17:49,840
um

1921
01:17:49,840 --> 01:17:51,600
maybe i can just take this and put it

1922
01:17:51,600 --> 01:17:55,480
around it um

1923
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:02,320
i don't know let's see how it reacts to

1924
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:03,600
the

1925
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,440
the area here you see you see how i

1926
01:18:05,440 --> 01:18:07,600
mentioned that there could be a reaction

1927
01:18:07,600 --> 01:18:09,600
here but oftentimes with this like i

1928
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:11,840
mentioned yesterday sometimes these are

1929
01:18:11,840 --> 01:18:14,320
placed as fake s and d zones

1930
01:18:14,320 --> 01:18:16,719
so with the fake s and d zones they

1931
01:18:16,719 --> 01:18:18,000
create them

1932
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:20,480
and move out of the area and obviously

1933
01:18:20,480 --> 01:18:22,560
as retailers we're expecting to be able

1934
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,560
to trade higher from it and we get

1935
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:25,840
railed

1936
01:18:25,840 --> 01:18:27,040
because

1937
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:29,760
usually the s and d zones are the zones

1938
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,280
that there was a huge amount of selling

1939
01:18:33,280 --> 01:18:34,560
going into

1940
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,560
and then you started seeing a huge

1941
01:18:36,560 --> 01:18:38,640
amount of buying coming out of

1942
01:18:38,640 --> 01:18:41,280
those zones are the zones that they have

1943
01:18:41,280 --> 01:18:43,920
their stops behind those are the zones

1944
01:18:43,920 --> 01:18:46,480
that you can you know kind of look for

1945
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:50,320
uh reactions to come out of

1946
01:18:50,320 --> 01:18:51,840
you know so

1947
01:18:51,840 --> 01:18:53,920
let me see it you see how it touched

1948
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:55,679
into this one here

1949
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,239
and now you see the push up from this

1950
01:18:58,239 --> 01:19:02,400
zone right here this little one here

1951
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,440
and it just railed through that one let

1952
01:19:05,440 --> 01:19:08,080
me see uh my honest opinion that area is

1953
01:19:08,080 --> 01:19:09,679
getting wiped out

1954
01:19:09,679 --> 01:19:13,280
that area never pushed up to any highs

1955
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:15,120
yeah that's what i'm thinking you know

1956
01:19:15,120 --> 01:19:18,000
because trend line liquidity

1957
01:19:18,000 --> 01:19:19,280
usually there's some trend line

1958
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:20,560
liquidity

1959
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,800
that's involved then you have this like

1960
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,880
push up from this little this little

1961
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,560
consolidated area you have this huge

1962
01:19:26,560 --> 01:19:29,360
push-up usually you know that's a result

1963
01:19:29,360 --> 01:19:32,239
of um what do they call a displacement

1964
01:19:32,239 --> 01:19:33,440
and um

1965
01:19:33,440 --> 01:19:37,040
you you get a tap into you know whatever

1966
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:38,960
zone that's up here

1967
01:19:38,960 --> 01:19:41,360
and then you get a huge selling out of

1968
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:43,840
the area so yeah that that could

1969
01:19:43,840 --> 01:19:46,480
potentially um happen and yeah because

1970
01:19:46,480 --> 01:19:49,840
it didn't you know um take any highs i

1971
01:19:49,840 --> 01:19:52,239
always say that you know the equal lows

1972
01:19:52,239 --> 01:19:55,440
often the equal highs oftentimes result

1973
01:19:55,440 --> 01:19:58,880
in a run of the low sometimes being the

1974
01:19:58,880 --> 01:20:01,280
first low but we can't discount this s

1975
01:20:01,280 --> 01:20:02,640
and d here

1976
01:20:02,640 --> 01:20:04,560
right here within this area

1977
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,280
because this is a protected low

1978
01:20:07,280 --> 01:20:09,679
so they could still be trying to take

1979
01:20:09,679 --> 01:20:11,280
out the highs

1980
01:20:11,280 --> 01:20:13,600
if they come back and find support

1981
01:20:13,600 --> 01:20:16,320
around the low that they originally had

1982
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,480
to where they started to to

1983
01:20:18,480 --> 01:20:20,880
buy up into if you find support here

1984
01:20:20,880 --> 01:20:23,840
oftentimes you'll have that um

1985
01:20:23,840 --> 01:20:26,239
run some of the highs

1986
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:29,520
that could potentially happen

1987
01:20:29,520 --> 01:20:31,199
so you know those are things that you

1988
01:20:31,199 --> 01:20:32,880
just want to pay attention to when you

1989
01:20:32,880 --> 01:20:35,199
get to some of these s d's you want to

1990
01:20:35,199 --> 01:20:38,560
see good s and d zones be zones where

1991
01:20:38,560 --> 01:20:40,320
they sold off into and immediately

1992
01:20:40,320 --> 01:20:42,159
started buying up

1993
01:20:42,159 --> 01:20:44,480
not to where they bought up and then

1994
01:20:44,480 --> 01:20:46,320
sold the next candle and then bought

1995
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:49,199
after you know that tends to i mean it's

1996
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,120
a little bit dodgy you know a little

1997
01:20:51,120 --> 01:20:52,480
sketchy like they did the same thing

1998
01:20:52,480 --> 01:20:54,719
here you see how they sold here they

1999
01:20:54,719 --> 01:20:56,800
bought here and then started selling off

2000
01:20:56,800 --> 01:20:59,520
again here so when you go up into this

2001
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:02,480
area you realize that this is sort of

2002
01:21:02,480 --> 01:21:05,280
like a fake zone sort of and you might

2003
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:07,120
have it to where price

2004
01:21:07,120 --> 01:21:09,679
pushes directly through that zone

2005
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:12,480
because it's just a fake smd there

2006
01:21:12,480 --> 01:21:14,159
so you want to make sure that there's

2007
01:21:14,159 --> 01:21:16,400
there's at least some sizable movement

2008
01:21:16,400 --> 01:21:19,120
going into your zone and then

2009
01:21:19,120 --> 01:21:21,280
it goes out of it so that's a more

2010
01:21:21,280 --> 01:21:24,960
likely area than like a more likely area

2011
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,480
here than you know an area like this

2012
01:21:28,480 --> 01:21:30,320
and that would help you stay out of you

2013
01:21:30,320 --> 01:21:32,400
know certain traits

2014
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:34,159
but yeah that that's exactly what i was

2015
01:21:34,159 --> 01:21:36,639
saying um i came i'm i was thinking that

2016
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:39,280
if we tapped up into this area here we

2017
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,040
could potentially come down into these

2018
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,719
areas and find support but if we don't

2019
01:21:42,719 --> 01:21:45,360
we'd end up running the lows

2020
01:21:45,360 --> 01:21:47,040
but you you just want to look at what

2021
01:21:47,040 --> 01:21:49,600
happens within those areas that you get

2022
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:50,480
to

2023
01:21:50,480 --> 01:21:52,800
that's what you want to pay attention to

2024
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:55,760
what is happening within the area that

2025
01:21:55,760 --> 01:21:58,320
i'm looking to get involved in and when

2026
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,600
you see

2027
01:21:59,600 --> 01:22:02,719
a certain type of you know flip or or a

2028
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,239
certain type of pattern that happens

2029
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:06,320
within your area

2030
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,000
that's when

2031
01:22:08,000 --> 01:22:09,840
you're going to involve yourself in it

2032
01:22:09,840 --> 01:22:11,280
but if you see that there are already

2033
01:22:11,280 --> 01:22:13,679
mitigations to your area if there are

2034
01:22:13,679 --> 01:22:15,600
mitigations that are there already

2035
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,040
you're not looking to get involved in

2036
01:22:17,040 --> 01:22:20,159
that area yes this area is

2037
01:22:20,159 --> 01:22:22,639
you know a a quick it was a quick scalp

2038
01:22:22,639 --> 01:22:24,960
up you know if it tapped into this area

2039
01:22:24,960 --> 01:22:26,880
and you you had a huge push-up yeah

2040
01:22:26,880 --> 01:22:29,040
about a 40-pip scalp up

2041
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:30,960
you know you can play that as a quick

2042
01:22:30,960 --> 01:22:31,920
move-up

2043
01:22:31,920 --> 01:22:34,480
you know from an area like this but

2044
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:36,000
when you look at

2045
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:37,840
you know the charts overall and you

2046
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,080
begin to try to figure out like what's

2047
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,560
going on with price you know within some

2048
01:22:42,560 --> 01:22:44,159
of these areas

2049
01:22:44,159 --> 01:22:46,320
you start to understand

2050
01:22:46,320 --> 01:22:48,400
from a larger standpoint what

2051
01:22:48,400 --> 01:22:50,960
potentially is happening so if you look

2052
01:22:50,960 --> 01:22:53,360
we had

2053
01:22:53,360 --> 01:22:56,400
we had this high put in

2054
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,120
we had this low put in

2055
01:22:59,120 --> 01:23:01,520
we had this high put in

2056
01:23:01,520 --> 01:23:04,480
then we ran this low

2057
01:23:04,480 --> 01:23:06,480
so after running the low we're coming

2058
01:23:06,480 --> 01:23:08,719
back up into the area and like i

2059
01:23:08,719 --> 01:23:10,560
mentioned you can come into like the 80

2060
01:23:10,560 --> 01:23:13,360
90 of the area sometimes so this is why

2061
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:15,120
when people are using the fibonaccis and

2062
01:23:15,120 --> 01:23:16,320
they're saying it's

2063
01:23:16,320 --> 01:23:19,360
it's gonna go to the the 61.8

2064
01:23:19,360 --> 01:23:22,239
and and fall from there yes

2065
01:23:22,239 --> 01:23:23,679
there's a there's a possibility that

2066
01:23:23,679 --> 01:23:25,520
that happens and yes that happens more

2067
01:23:25,520 --> 01:23:26,880
time than not

2068
01:23:26,880 --> 01:23:30,000
but do not use that absence of structure

2069
01:23:30,000 --> 01:23:32,000
you have to make sure that you're using

2070
01:23:32,000 --> 01:23:34,880
it along with structure

2071
01:23:34,880 --> 01:23:37,600
to be able to benefit or from from a

2072
01:23:37,600 --> 01:23:39,360
tool like that to be able to benefit

2073
01:23:39,360 --> 01:23:41,920
from from utilizing something like that

2074
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,440
you want to make sure that you're using

2075
01:23:43,440 --> 01:23:44,960
it with structure

2076
01:23:44,960 --> 01:23:46,320
not with

2077
01:23:46,320 --> 01:23:49,120
with you know just your own volition of

2078
01:23:49,120 --> 01:23:50,719
what you think price is going to do when

2079
01:23:50,719 --> 01:23:53,360
it gets to that area so we go up into

2080
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:56,000
the 90 of the area here

2081
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:58,159
and we reject away from it

2082
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:01,280
now we know that we created this trend

2083
01:24:01,280 --> 01:24:03,040
line here

2084
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,400
going up trend line liquidity going up

2085
01:24:06,400 --> 01:24:09,360
here right here could be a fake pump to

2086
01:24:09,360 --> 01:24:12,239
another touch of the trend line

2087
01:24:12,239 --> 01:24:13,360
and then

2088
01:24:13,360 --> 01:24:16,000
what you have happen is

2089
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:17,520
sorry there was just noise that was

2090
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,840
hearing yeah this could be a fake touch

2091
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:21,040
to the

2092
01:24:21,040 --> 01:24:23,520
the the trend line you have a push up

2093
01:24:23,520 --> 01:24:26,159
and then what you have is a run of it

2094
01:24:26,159 --> 01:24:27,520
the same thing that happened yesterday

2095
01:24:27,520 --> 01:24:29,600
the the run of that that trend line that

2096
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:33,679
we had you could potentially have that

2097
01:24:35,199 --> 01:24:37,440
so yeah let me um actually no we can't

2098
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:38,880
even go to the higher time frames to

2099
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:40,159
look at anything down here because

2100
01:24:40,159 --> 01:24:42,639
there's really nothing back there so

2101
01:24:42,639 --> 01:24:44,480
this is just on the higher time frames

2102
01:24:44,480 --> 01:24:47,040
that that we have these areas

2103
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:49,040
and it's just you know some stuff within

2104
01:24:49,040 --> 01:24:50,880
here of course you could still scalp too

2105
01:24:50,880 --> 01:24:52,719
if you wanted to you know like i said

2106
01:24:52,719 --> 01:24:54,800
there was a touch of this zone

2107
01:24:54,800 --> 01:24:56,639
you know pushed up you're able to get a

2108
01:24:56,639 --> 01:24:58,880
quick scalp there um

2109
01:24:58,880 --> 01:25:01,199
there's an imbalance within here

2110
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:02,800
within this area

2111
01:25:02,800 --> 01:25:05,920
um as well as um a fractal just below

2112
01:25:05,920 --> 01:25:07,360
the imbalance

2113
01:25:07,360 --> 01:25:08,480
you know so

2114
01:25:08,480 --> 01:25:10,960
maybe it could tap into the imbalance

2115
01:25:10,960 --> 01:25:12,800
you know stops behind the fractal and

2116
01:25:12,800 --> 01:25:13,600
then

2117
01:25:13,600 --> 01:25:14,560
have a

2118
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,040
retracement up before coming down yeah

2119
01:25:17,040 --> 01:25:18,560
there's a possibility

2120
01:25:18,560 --> 01:25:20,960
you know even coming into this area here

2121
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:23,199
like yeah so that would make the fractal

2122
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:25,040
a little more likely because the fractal

2123
01:25:25,040 --> 01:25:28,480
is more so you know positioned within um

2124
01:25:28,480 --> 01:25:30,880
this area that price traded out of so

2125
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,960
yeah that that's that could potentially

2126
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,719
happen too let me see if i um

2127
01:25:36,719 --> 01:25:41,560
could actually take this

2128
01:25:41,920 --> 01:25:43,120
uh

2129
01:25:43,120 --> 01:25:44,320
yeah yeah

2130
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,440
yeah okay yeah

2131
01:25:47,440 --> 01:25:49,440
so you could potentially have some sort

2132
01:25:49,440 --> 01:25:52,560
of reaction within this area if it does

2133
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,560
come down here

2134
01:25:54,560 --> 01:25:56,080
you know you you could have a reaction

2135
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,000
within this area remember we still have

2136
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,080
this s and d holding we had a double

2137
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:02,880
bounce on it so we want to look to

2138
01:26:02,880 --> 01:26:05,440
probably see if it's going to come up to

2139
01:26:05,440 --> 01:26:07,520
this fractal maybe hit the middle of

2140
01:26:07,520 --> 01:26:09,920
this imbalance here i got to do better

2141
01:26:09,920 --> 01:26:13,920
with moving my my lines out the way um

2142
01:26:13,920 --> 01:26:15,920
so we have three potential areas we have

2143
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:18,480
this imbalance here

2144
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:22,679
we have this fractal here

2145
01:26:23,120 --> 01:26:24,800
and then um

2146
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:27,840
the snd above

2147
01:26:28,639 --> 01:26:30,719
so let's see what what we get within

2148
01:26:30,719 --> 01:26:33,120
this area and guys if you can uh go

2149
01:26:33,120 --> 01:26:34,960
ahead and like this video

2150
01:26:34,960 --> 01:26:38,239
is good for the algorithm you get

2151
01:26:38,239 --> 01:26:40,800
these videos out to some more of the the

2152
01:26:40,800 --> 01:26:42,719
other traders that are on the other side

2153
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:43,920
of um

2154
01:26:43,920 --> 01:26:45,920
retail and smart money and it'll

2155
01:26:45,920 --> 01:26:47,520
actually give them

2156
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,560
information that's like beneficial

2157
01:26:50,560 --> 01:26:52,880
to them beneficial to

2158
01:26:52,880 --> 01:26:55,360
to their life you know so you guys go

2159
01:26:55,360 --> 01:26:56,880
and do that let me go back and check go

2160
01:26:56,880 --> 01:26:58,400
real quick i'm

2161
01:26:58,400 --> 01:26:59,280
wondering if i

2162
01:26:59,280 --> 01:27:02,330
[Music]

2163
01:27:03,679 --> 01:27:06,159
so you see what i'm saying guys like oh

2164
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:08,639
my gosh like this is

2165
01:27:08,639 --> 01:27:10,719
this is this is why the discord is going

2166
01:27:10,719 --> 01:27:14,080
to be powerful man oh my goodness

2167
01:27:14,080 --> 01:27:16,000
you know so

2168
01:27:16,000 --> 01:27:18,239
so i have price coming into this area

2169
01:27:18,239 --> 01:27:20,719
here um

2170
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:22,480
and i essentially said if we tapped into

2171
01:27:22,480 --> 01:27:24,000
this area

2172
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:26,080
we would go long from this area but i

2173
01:27:26,080 --> 01:27:28,960
first had us tapping into somewhere up

2174
01:27:28,960 --> 01:27:30,000
here

2175
01:27:30,000 --> 01:27:30,840
which

2176
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,400
um probably more so did it run this low

2177
01:27:34,400 --> 01:27:36,639
so if it was this low if i saw it

2178
01:27:36,639 --> 01:27:38,880
actually run this low before coming here

2179
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:40,880
then i would have had it going here see

2180
01:27:40,880 --> 01:27:42,880
i tapped my line exactly

2181
01:27:42,880 --> 01:27:44,800
if it ran this low i would have had it

2182
01:27:44,800 --> 01:27:46,960
coming up to here i didn't see it run

2183
01:27:46,960 --> 01:27:49,199
this low yet i just saw it tap into this

2184
01:27:49,199 --> 01:27:51,679
area and go up so if it ran this low i

2185
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:53,040
would have been like okay we're probably

2186
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,280
going to retrace into this area first

2187
01:27:55,280 --> 01:27:57,520
and then short and where we where would

2188
01:27:57,520 --> 01:27:59,440
we begin to short we would short from

2189
01:27:59,440 --> 01:28:00,639
here

2190
01:28:00,639 --> 01:28:03,840
to this area but i also had this line

2191
01:28:03,840 --> 01:28:04,960
here

2192
01:28:04,960 --> 01:28:06,800
and i said we could potentially come out

2193
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:11,840
of this area and long above the high

2194
01:28:11,840 --> 01:28:14,639
either way even if my short was from

2195
01:28:14,639 --> 01:28:15,679
here

2196
01:28:15,679 --> 01:28:16,560
and

2197
01:28:16,560 --> 01:28:18,960
it didn't touch and it immediately went

2198
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,840
to the area i still had a plan for when

2199
01:28:21,840 --> 01:28:24,719
price got to this area here

2200
01:28:24,719 --> 01:28:26,320
and what was the plan for when price got

2201
01:28:26,320 --> 01:28:28,880
to this area here the plan was that

2202
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,520
price would tap into this area stops

2203
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:33,280
behind the zone

2204
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,280
and then you can take a long out of the

2205
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,880
area to go up here

2206
01:28:36,880 --> 01:28:39,040
look at this this long is from last

2207
01:28:39,040 --> 01:28:41,760
night i like i always said i like to see

2208
01:28:41,760 --> 01:28:43,920
you like a double bottom within my area

2209
01:28:43,920 --> 01:28:46,480
or equal low within my area for price to

2210
01:28:46,480 --> 01:28:48,800
push up but if you look at this look

2211
01:28:48,800 --> 01:28:52,880
look at this this is this is crazy

2212
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:55,600
this is from last night

2213
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:56,480
into

2214
01:28:56,480 --> 01:28:58,639
actually early this morning

2215
01:28:58,639 --> 01:29:00,080
into

2216
01:29:00,080 --> 01:29:01,440
right now

2217
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:05,040
this is thirty dollars that gold move

2218
01:29:05,040 --> 01:29:07,199
so that's about some people call it 300

2219
01:29:07,199 --> 01:29:08,880
pips some people call it 3 000 pips

2220
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:11,920
depending on you know their metrics but

2221
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:15,600
this pushed all the way up to this area

2222
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:17,920
just from coming to an area that i

2223
01:29:17,920 --> 01:29:19,040
marked out

2224
01:29:19,040 --> 01:29:20,400
and i think i might have marked out this

2225
01:29:20,400 --> 01:29:24,360
area on a 15 minute

2226
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:27,760
yeah right here on on the yeah it was

2227
01:29:27,760 --> 01:29:30,719
here i actually was this it was this i

2228
01:29:30,719 --> 01:29:33,199
said that you see this long wick right

2229
01:29:33,199 --> 01:29:34,480
here

2230
01:29:34,480 --> 01:29:36,400
from the top of this area to the bottom

2231
01:29:36,400 --> 01:29:37,760
of this area

2232
01:29:37,760 --> 01:29:39,199
i always say that i want to see

2233
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,800
mitigation at least by 50 percent

2234
01:29:42,800 --> 01:29:44,000
at least

2235
01:29:44,000 --> 01:29:46,400
this tapped into this area

2236
01:29:46,400 --> 01:29:49,199
and then went long out of the area just

2237
01:29:49,199 --> 01:29:51,600
from the 15 minute time frame i noticed

2238
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:54,159
this so i saw the break of this low

2239
01:29:54,159 --> 01:29:56,320
after taking this high i said okay if we

2240
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,320
run this low we could potentially go

2241
01:29:58,320 --> 01:30:01,040
back up into this area and then short

2242
01:30:01,040 --> 01:30:03,520
but where can we find support down into

2243
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:07,600
this area and then we long out of it

2244
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:10,320
look at that that's that's wild exactly

2245
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:12,800
on on a one lot

2246
01:30:12,800 --> 01:30:16,080
three thousand dollars on one lot just

2247
01:30:16,080 --> 01:30:18,960
finding this this huge move here and

2248
01:30:18,960 --> 01:30:21,040
this is just stuff that i randomly do

2249
01:30:21,040 --> 01:30:23,840
and go back and check later on i don't

2250
01:30:23,840 --> 01:30:25,679
i don't actually like you know i'm here

2251
01:30:25,679 --> 01:30:27,360
watching the charts and i'm like yeah

2252
01:30:27,360 --> 01:30:29,600
well gold is going to i don't trade gold

2253
01:30:29,600 --> 01:30:30,800
you know i really don't care for it i

2254
01:30:30,800 --> 01:30:33,120
love us 30. you know but i really don't

2255
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:35,440
pay attention much to gold because

2256
01:30:35,440 --> 01:30:37,679
like i mean all you need is one

2257
01:30:37,679 --> 01:30:39,840
instrument one thing

2258
01:30:39,840 --> 01:30:42,000
you can find six

2259
01:30:42,000 --> 01:30:44,719
thousand different variations

2260
01:30:44,719 --> 01:30:46,320
for one

2261
01:30:46,320 --> 01:30:48,960
thing that you are trading

2262
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:50,239
6

2263
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:51,440
000

2264
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:52,639
so

2265
01:30:52,639 --> 01:30:54,560
if if you can

2266
01:30:54,560 --> 01:30:58,880
find 6 000 trades within one instrument

2267
01:30:58,880 --> 01:31:00,320
why do you have to trade a bunch of

2268
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:02,480
different things you don't need to why

2269
01:31:02,480 --> 01:31:04,400
why diverse

2270
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:06,480
why diversify

2271
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:08,639
just stick to one thing you you know

2272
01:31:08,639 --> 01:31:10,239
what's gonna happen with that one thing

2273
01:31:10,239 --> 01:31:12,639
stick to that so if gold falls back gold

2274
01:31:12,639 --> 01:31:15,199
could potentially have some

2275
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,520
support here at this smd

2276
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:18,719
that's here

2277
01:31:18,719 --> 01:31:20,400
i could potentially um

2278
01:31:20,400 --> 01:31:22,400
find some support here and then uh

2279
01:31:22,400 --> 01:31:25,600
continue to push up like this

2280
01:31:25,600 --> 01:31:27,520
but sometimes uh before i go to bed i

2281
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:29,679
just look over the charts see what's

2282
01:31:29,679 --> 01:31:31,520
been going on maybe from a higher time

2283
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:32,960
frame because the asian session is a

2284
01:31:32,960 --> 01:31:35,600
little bit slower and then i'm like okay

2285
01:31:35,600 --> 01:31:37,120
this could happen i could tap there and

2286
01:31:37,120 --> 01:31:39,280
then you know go to that area

2287
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:40,639
let me come back tomorrow and see if it

2288
01:31:40,639 --> 01:31:41,520
happened

2289
01:31:41,520 --> 01:31:43,600
and then i come back and and these are

2290
01:31:43,600 --> 01:31:45,440
very real trades that people can be

2291
01:31:45,440 --> 01:31:47,760
taking you know like

2292
01:31:47,760 --> 01:31:50,719
this it's just i'm so random with it

2293
01:31:50,719 --> 01:31:52,800
these are things that if this was with

2294
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:54,320
with uh uh

2295
01:31:54,320 --> 01:31:57,120
you know gj i was i was very random with

2296
01:31:57,120 --> 01:32:00,000
this even up here i was very random with

2297
01:32:00,000 --> 01:32:02,000
this said that it could tap into this

2298
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:04,239
area possibly and then continue to short

2299
01:32:04,239 --> 01:32:05,760
out of the area

2300
01:32:05,760 --> 01:32:08,880
very very random i saw this equal high

2301
01:32:08,880 --> 01:32:09,840
here

2302
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:11,840
oh boy when you see that equal high or

2303
01:32:11,840 --> 01:32:14,159
equal low in your area you know it's

2304
01:32:14,159 --> 01:32:16,800
about to blast off and once you see the

2305
01:32:16,800 --> 01:32:19,040
rejection out of that area yep you could

2306
01:32:19,040 --> 01:32:21,440
definitely look to run the lows at least

2307
01:32:21,440 --> 01:32:23,520
the first low at a second and i always

2308
01:32:23,520 --> 01:32:25,679
say that each and every time once you

2309
01:32:25,679 --> 01:32:27,920
see that you could expect

2310
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,320
the if you didn't take any highs you

2311
01:32:30,320 --> 01:32:31,520
could see

2312
01:32:31,520 --> 01:32:34,159
that that low being ran so this is stuff

2313
01:32:34,159 --> 01:32:34,880
that

2314
01:32:34,880 --> 01:32:37,920
i'm just randomly throwing here like

2315
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:40,719
there's there's no like uh let me

2316
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,400
actually look at this see if i have any

2317
01:32:42,400 --> 01:32:45,600
trades within here no i don't i usually

2318
01:32:45,600 --> 01:32:47,280
send them to to my friends every now and

2319
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:49,520
again or just sends them to people you

2320
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,360
know being like oh this may happen i

2321
01:32:51,360 --> 01:32:53,520
don't know you know just

2322
01:32:53,520 --> 01:32:55,360
look at it yeah let's check back

2323
01:32:55,360 --> 01:32:58,080
tomorrow and and it happens that exact

2324
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:01,520
way like almost always so i i know that

2325
01:33:01,520 --> 01:33:03,120
the discord is going to be very very

2326
01:33:03,120 --> 01:33:04,159
powerful

2327
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,960
um for us because i just randomly go on

2328
01:33:06,960 --> 01:33:09,679
charts if anybody asked me for a chart

2329
01:33:09,679 --> 01:33:13,120
to look let me see there was um

2330
01:33:13,199 --> 01:33:14,960
this

2331
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:17,520
no was it odd cat

2332
01:33:17,520 --> 01:33:21,280
was it there was somebody that asked me

2333
01:33:21,280 --> 01:33:24,400
some time ago about odd cad i think it

2334
01:33:24,400 --> 01:33:26,719
was

2335
01:33:29,440 --> 01:33:31,440
yes it was odd cad

2336
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:33,360
so i had mentioned that

2337
01:33:33,360 --> 01:33:36,320
we could potentially shift up from this

2338
01:33:36,320 --> 01:33:37,679
area

2339
01:33:37,679 --> 01:33:40,560
and you know push back down but i had i

2340
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:42,320
think i said overall that that we were

2341
01:33:42,320 --> 01:33:44,239
bearish on a day this is back to one of

2342
01:33:44,239 --> 01:33:46,880
my streams like it's it's all on there

2343
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,080
you know and

2344
01:33:48,080 --> 01:33:50,320
you know we definitely tapped right into

2345
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:51,679
my area

2346
01:33:51,679 --> 01:33:54,000
up here and then shifted downward and

2347
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,199
this was just from a four-hour

2348
01:33:55,199 --> 01:33:57,280
perspective i've never

2349
01:33:57,280 --> 01:34:00,480
ever traded on cab before like ever like

2350
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:01,760
some of these things that people ask me

2351
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:02,960
to analyze

2352
01:34:02,960 --> 01:34:05,600
never ever trade it but

2353
01:34:05,600 --> 01:34:07,920
i i analyze i

2354
01:34:07,920 --> 01:34:10,719
you know i back test on i i make sure i

2355
01:34:10,719 --> 01:34:13,679
i sharpen my strategies just just

2356
01:34:13,679 --> 01:34:15,840
utilizing this but i don't see look this

2357
01:34:15,840 --> 01:34:18,320
is probably

2358
01:34:18,320 --> 01:34:19,760
yeah like this was early in the year

2359
01:34:19,760 --> 01:34:23,360
we're still using these kind of fibs

2360
01:34:23,360 --> 01:34:26,320
look at this this is so funny

2361
01:34:26,320 --> 01:34:27,920
yeah this is early in the year wha what

2362
01:34:27,920 --> 01:34:31,040
was i doing here

2363
01:34:31,440 --> 01:34:34,320
i don't know was i

2364
01:34:34,880 --> 01:34:36,960
i don't know what i was doing was i

2365
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,679
fibbing the high and low here

2366
01:34:39,679 --> 01:34:42,560
was it like this

2367
01:34:45,679 --> 01:34:48,480
hey was that flipping the last high low

2368
01:34:48,480 --> 01:34:50,560
yeah i think you see

2369
01:34:50,560 --> 01:34:52,800
look i was taking the last high

2370
01:34:52,800 --> 01:34:54,400
in the last low

2371
01:34:54,400 --> 01:34:56,000
and saying that price would come and tap

2372
01:34:56,000 --> 01:34:58,719
the 61.8 percent and go

2373
01:34:58,719 --> 01:35:00,480
this is the type of trading that i was

2374
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:02,320
doing um

2375
01:35:02,320 --> 01:35:04,080
you know within like when i was first

2376
01:35:04,080 --> 01:35:06,320
learning retail concepts i was utilizing

2377
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:08,400
like stuff like this and i'm like okay

2378
01:35:08,400 --> 01:35:11,199
if attack taps to 61

2379
01:35:11,199 --> 01:35:15,199
then it could potentially go to the 27 i

2380
01:35:15,199 --> 01:35:17,360
think i used to say and i used to say if

2381
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:19,920
it goes to 61 it might reverse from

2382
01:35:19,920 --> 01:35:20,880
there

2383
01:35:20,880 --> 01:35:22,639
this is so interesting that you can go

2384
01:35:22,639 --> 01:35:25,520
back and look at like the stuff you used

2385
01:35:25,520 --> 01:35:26,880
to do

2386
01:35:26,880 --> 01:35:28,560
you know versus

2387
01:35:28,560 --> 01:35:31,119
like what you do now there's there's so

2388
01:35:31,119 --> 01:35:34,560
much growth so much growth you know like

2389
01:35:34,560 --> 01:35:37,119
even utilizing like um

2390
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,880
like these little order blocks at the

2391
01:35:38,880 --> 01:35:41,199
time i was learning order blocks and i'm

2392
01:35:41,199 --> 01:35:43,840
like oh okay if it taps here then you

2393
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:45,760
could short from here look just rail

2394
01:35:45,760 --> 01:35:47,679
through that area

2395
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:50,560
and tap the area above so this is this

2396
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,800
was just the way that that i was

2397
01:35:52,800 --> 01:35:54,480
learning um

2398
01:35:54,480 --> 01:35:56,400
people here might not even know but you

2399
01:35:56,400 --> 01:35:58,000
got to pay attention you got to pay

2400
01:35:58,000 --> 01:36:00,080
thousands to learn what you yes this is

2401
01:36:00,080 --> 01:36:02,159
exactly what i'm saying

2402
01:36:02,159 --> 01:36:03,920
this is exactly what i'm saying you you

2403
01:36:03,920 --> 01:36:05,520
have to pay

2404
01:36:05,520 --> 01:36:07,520
thousands of dollars for this

2405
01:36:07,520 --> 01:36:10,960
information like like people charge so

2406
01:36:10,960 --> 01:36:14,320
much money to to share things like this

2407
01:36:14,320 --> 01:36:17,199
and and for me i'm just like i'm robin

2408
01:36:17,199 --> 01:36:19,600
hood not not the you know disabled to

2409
01:36:19,600 --> 01:36:21,920
buy button robin hood but like you know

2410
01:36:21,920 --> 01:36:24,880
i'm i'm robin hood like i'd rather

2411
01:36:24,880 --> 01:36:27,440
people know and understand this to gain

2412
01:36:27,440 --> 01:36:30,080
a sense of you know financial freedom

2413
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:33,280
for their lives and i say that because

2414
01:36:33,280 --> 01:36:36,400
when when we have issues such as like

2415
01:36:36,400 --> 01:36:38,960
you know high crime rate and and and

2416
01:36:38,960 --> 01:36:41,280
like we're dealing with thefts at an

2417
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:44,480
all-time high when it comes to like just

2418
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:46,800
baby food and and just all these

2419
01:36:46,800 --> 01:36:49,440
different things you know a lot of it

2420
01:36:49,440 --> 01:36:52,159
comes from not being able to afford

2421
01:36:52,159 --> 01:36:54,320
those things and some jobs people are

2422
01:36:54,320 --> 01:36:56,239
working it's it's not enough look at

2423
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:59,280
inflation man it's it's destroying some

2424
01:36:59,280 --> 01:37:02,080
people destroying families

2425
01:37:02,080 --> 01:37:05,760
and and i can't bear to know that that

2426
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:06,880
you know

2427
01:37:06,880 --> 01:37:08,800
i might be

2428
01:37:08,800 --> 01:37:10,880
taking a vacation to jamaica every two

2429
01:37:10,880 --> 01:37:13,280
weeks or whatever it is but people are

2430
01:37:13,280 --> 01:37:14,800
suffering

2431
01:37:14,800 --> 01:37:17,199
you know like i can't stomach that i

2432
01:37:17,199 --> 01:37:19,679
know other people might be able to but i

2433
01:37:19,679 --> 01:37:22,159
cannot so i'm like you know what instead

2434
01:37:22,159 --> 01:37:25,199
of focusing on fatting in my pockets and

2435
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:27,520
and you know like charging people for

2436
01:37:27,520 --> 01:37:28,800
something that

2437
01:37:28,800 --> 01:37:31,280
i don't necessarily you know need their

2438
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:35,280
money for if i claim to be profitable

2439
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:37,280
i would just go out there and

2440
01:37:37,280 --> 01:37:39,440
actually teach people

2441
01:37:39,440 --> 01:37:40,960
show them these things you know help

2442
01:37:40,960 --> 01:37:42,639
them to learn this i always tell people

2443
01:37:42,639 --> 01:37:44,880
go back and learn through through the

2444
01:37:44,880 --> 01:37:47,280
videos that i have go back and and watch

2445
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:50,239
that stuff go back and you know like

2446
01:37:50,239 --> 01:37:52,719
there's so much information i'm talking

2447
01:37:52,719 --> 01:37:55,119
about and and you know i try to tell

2448
01:37:55,119 --> 01:37:57,199
people that i don't try to be you know

2449
01:37:57,199 --> 01:37:59,679
arrogant or cocky or anything like that

2450
01:37:59,679 --> 01:38:00,480
but

2451
01:38:00,480 --> 01:38:02,800
there is so much information in there

2452
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:05,920
that it's literally like master classes

2453
01:38:05,920 --> 01:38:07,840
you know like that type of information

2454
01:38:07,840 --> 01:38:09,600
you cannot

2455
01:38:09,600 --> 01:38:13,360
come by for free you will not find it

2456
01:38:13,360 --> 01:38:15,119
and people will just give

2457
01:38:15,119 --> 01:38:18,239
small portions of it even if you are

2458
01:38:18,239 --> 01:38:20,800
paying for it and not give you the whole

2459
01:38:20,800 --> 01:38:21,600
thing

2460
01:38:21,600 --> 01:38:23,679
and for me you know i just want to make

2461
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,719
sure that that people understand people

2462
01:38:26,719 --> 01:38:29,520
people learn people you know like

2463
01:38:29,520 --> 01:38:31,840
like find their way out of these things

2464
01:38:31,840 --> 01:38:33,440
you know and and for people who are

2465
01:38:33,440 --> 01:38:35,199
willing they have something that they

2466
01:38:35,199 --> 01:38:36,400
could learn that could take care of them

2467
01:38:36,400 --> 01:38:38,159
for the rest of their life tell me if

2468
01:38:38,159 --> 01:38:40,719
you apply yourself to this the rest of

2469
01:38:40,719 --> 01:38:42,639
your life

2470
01:38:42,639 --> 01:38:44,080
you can learn something from this you

2471
01:38:44,080 --> 01:38:45,360
see how i just mentioned that there was

2472
01:38:45,360 --> 01:38:47,440
an imbalance here i'll tell you guys be

2473
01:38:47,440 --> 01:38:49,760
mindful of the imbalance this right here

2474
01:38:49,760 --> 01:38:51,199
look at this

2475
01:38:51,199 --> 01:38:53,119
i have mentioned this imbalance and i

2476
01:38:53,119 --> 01:38:55,280
said that you know some imbalances you

2477
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:57,520
tend to have reactions to

2478
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,840
so if you see the tap within this area

2479
01:39:01,840 --> 01:39:04,639
we hit this area of imbalance

2480
01:39:04,639 --> 01:39:07,119
and look we traded all the way up to

2481
01:39:07,119 --> 01:39:09,840
where the next imbalance

2482
01:39:09,840 --> 01:39:12,000
that was here let's say you just traded

2483
01:39:12,000 --> 01:39:14,159
up to here let's say you just took it to

2484
01:39:14,159 --> 01:39:15,360
to

2485
01:39:15,360 --> 01:39:17,199
right here from the imbalance quick

2486
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:19,119
scalp right up into this area you start

2487
01:39:19,119 --> 01:39:21,280
to see some resistance you got out

2488
01:39:21,280 --> 01:39:24,080
cool 30 pips

2489
01:39:24,080 --> 01:39:26,000
30 pips just from the top of this

2490
01:39:26,000 --> 01:39:27,280
imbalance

2491
01:39:27,280 --> 01:39:30,080
but you're you're aware of why there's

2492
01:39:30,080 --> 01:39:32,080
some push out of this area so if you

2493
01:39:32,080 --> 01:39:34,719
were in this short coming from here look

2494
01:39:34,719 --> 01:39:38,239
at this i keep talking about uh

2495
01:39:38,239 --> 01:39:40,960
these these uh these concepts i just see

2496
01:39:40,960 --> 01:39:44,719
them everywhere look head and shoulders

2497
01:39:44,719 --> 01:39:46,560
i can't get it out of my mind i don't

2498
01:39:46,560 --> 01:39:48,880
know why like it it's just

2499
01:39:48,880 --> 01:39:52,960
it's so funny that this happens like

2500
01:39:52,960 --> 01:39:55,679
so so yeah you you

2501
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:57,199
you know they they believe that it's

2502
01:39:57,199 --> 01:39:59,119
it's coming back to you know where it

2503
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:00,719
came from which it could potentially

2504
01:40:00,719 --> 01:40:02,639
come back to this area yeah but like i

2505
01:40:02,639 --> 01:40:03,440
said

2506
01:40:03,440 --> 01:40:05,199
we're using this absence of structure

2507
01:40:05,199 --> 01:40:07,520
it's like a 30 win rate on it there's no

2508
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:10,239
way that that i would use this but you

2509
01:40:10,239 --> 01:40:12,800
know these things that i i make note of

2510
01:40:12,800 --> 01:40:14,960
and i mentioned to you you can go back

2511
01:40:14,960 --> 01:40:17,199
and look and see

2512
01:40:17,199 --> 01:40:18,560
you know like

2513
01:40:18,560 --> 01:40:22,719
see how how they react in in

2514
01:40:22,719 --> 01:40:24,400
what is a back testing

2515
01:40:24,400 --> 01:40:25,280
or

2516
01:40:25,280 --> 01:40:28,080
you could also utilize it

2517
01:40:28,080 --> 01:40:30,080
to be able to

2518
01:40:30,080 --> 01:40:32,159
you know like learn scalping techniques

2519
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,639
from what forward testing

2520
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:36,880
just see how they react to those areas

2521
01:40:36,880 --> 01:40:39,520
so you have another imbalance this here

2522
01:40:39,520 --> 01:40:41,600
this is actually when we first came on

2523
01:40:41,600 --> 01:40:43,360
and the market opened i had mentioned

2524
01:40:43,360 --> 01:40:45,199
that there was an imbalance here we

2525
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:47,280
tapped into that area and look rejected

2526
01:40:47,280 --> 01:40:50,239
out of it then what do we do tap up into

2527
01:40:50,239 --> 01:40:51,760
this area here

2528
01:40:51,760 --> 01:40:53,520
within this area did we hit the line

2529
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:56,560
exactly no but we went into this area

2530
01:40:56,560 --> 01:40:59,600
tapped in and look we got an equal high

2531
01:40:59,600 --> 01:41:01,520
here what do i say with the equal highs

2532
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,600
equal highs often result in a run of the

2533
01:41:03,600 --> 01:41:04,639
low

2534
01:41:04,639 --> 01:41:06,239
we had a run of the low immediately

2535
01:41:06,239 --> 01:41:08,000
after

2536
01:41:08,000 --> 01:41:09,760
so i don't you know

2537
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:11,520
i was on the i think i was doing the top

2538
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:14,320
down um when this was happening but this

2539
01:41:14,320 --> 01:41:17,040
is something that i say over and over

2540
01:41:17,040 --> 01:41:20,320
and over and over again in all of these

2541
01:41:20,320 --> 01:41:23,280
videos it's i'm helping you to manage

2542
01:41:23,280 --> 01:41:25,360
your trades in real time helping you to

2543
01:41:25,360 --> 01:41:28,000
find areas to get in helping you to

2544
01:41:28,000 --> 01:41:30,320
understand that this is what happens and

2545
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:33,840
price does this like each and every time

2546
01:41:33,840 --> 01:41:35,840
price does this you know you might have

2547
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,560
like that that one or two percent you

2548
01:41:38,560 --> 01:41:41,440
know miss on it where it goes to it and

2549
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,440
just like steamrolls through it whatever

2550
01:41:43,440 --> 01:41:45,520
like sometimes you have that but it like

2551
01:41:45,520 --> 01:41:48,480
i said one or two percent

2552
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,280
so i'm telling you something that's

2553
01:41:50,280 --> 01:41:52,760
extremely efficient

2554
01:41:52,760 --> 01:41:55,440
extremely efficient and you could

2555
01:41:55,440 --> 01:41:58,560
utilize these things to be able to you

2556
01:41:58,560 --> 01:42:00,719
know like scalp from be able to like i

2557
01:42:00,719 --> 01:42:01,440
said

2558
01:42:01,440 --> 01:42:03,360
10 pips 20 pips

2559
01:42:03,360 --> 01:42:05,040
that's different to different account

2560
01:42:05,040 --> 01:42:07,199
sizes it means something different to

2561
01:42:07,199 --> 01:42:08,560
people but

2562
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,840
those high value you know pips

2563
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:13,920
you could have higher lot sizes on them

2564
01:42:13,920 --> 01:42:16,480
and just get a quick reaction out of the

2565
01:42:16,480 --> 01:42:18,159
area and you're good so let's say you

2566
01:42:18,159 --> 01:42:19,760
were on like a

2567
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,400
you know a 10 lot you know and you just

2568
01:42:22,400 --> 01:42:24,880
took that quick quick scout from this

2569
01:42:24,880 --> 01:42:27,199
area to this area granted if you have no

2570
01:42:27,199 --> 01:42:30,320
spread then you took home you know this

2571
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:32,239
300 dollars

2572
01:42:32,239 --> 01:42:33,520
if you do have a spread you might have

2573
01:42:33,520 --> 01:42:36,000
took home 250 on that but then when you

2574
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:39,760
saw another top of the imbalance here

2575
01:42:39,760 --> 01:42:42,400
and you ended up taking it down and you

2576
01:42:42,400 --> 01:42:44,080
saw there was some resistance some

2577
01:42:44,080 --> 01:42:45,840
rejection there

2578
01:42:45,840 --> 01:42:49,600
420 bucks if you have a zero pip spread

2579
01:42:49,600 --> 01:42:51,040
and you might have to sacrifice some

2580
01:42:51,040 --> 01:42:53,199
more pips you know for for the spread if

2581
01:42:53,199 --> 01:42:54,560
you don't have a zero pip spread but

2582
01:42:54,560 --> 01:42:58,080
then that's like 350 380 bucks

2583
01:42:58,080 --> 01:43:01,040
on these little scalps

2584
01:43:01,040 --> 01:43:02,880
little scalps

2585
01:43:02,880 --> 01:43:04,800
and if you want like a point one to take

2586
01:43:04,800 --> 01:43:07,840
like the longer moves or or a 0.5 or

2587
01:43:07,840 --> 01:43:10,159
whatever it is you know you can do that

2588
01:43:10,159 --> 01:43:11,920
now i trade on

2589
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:13,360
um

2590
01:43:13,360 --> 01:43:15,360
you know like a a

2591
01:43:15,360 --> 01:43:18,560
100 lot you know or sometimes 400 lot so

2592
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,000
those values are a little bit different

2593
01:43:20,000 --> 01:43:22,560
for me um but so i don't i don't always

2594
01:43:22,560 --> 01:43:24,639
say i always said i need just 24 pips a

2595
01:43:24,639 --> 01:43:26,320
week depending on what lot i'm trading

2596
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,560
on so yeah they they tend to be a lot

2597
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:30,239
different well look at this stab here

2598
01:43:30,239 --> 01:43:32,320
guys watch this stab usually when you

2599
01:43:32,320 --> 01:43:33,920
have a stab of this

2600
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,480
low and then quick trade away usually it

2601
01:43:36,480 --> 01:43:39,040
wants to go up so just pay attention to

2602
01:43:39,040 --> 01:43:40,880
that sometimes when it's consolidating

2603
01:43:40,880 --> 01:43:43,119
within this area that's just wipe off

2604
01:43:43,119 --> 01:43:45,440
happening within this area is weak to

2605
01:43:45,440 --> 01:43:47,199
strong hand transfer that's what wipe

2606
01:43:47,199 --> 01:43:48,719
off essentially is but you usually get

2607
01:43:48,719 --> 01:43:51,280
like a stab right below the area and

2608
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:53,840
then a quick trade away above that kind

2609
01:43:53,840 --> 01:43:56,480
of gives you some indication that um it

2610
01:43:56,480 --> 01:43:59,040
wants to uh continue higher

2611
01:43:59,040 --> 01:44:01,280
so um just pay attention to that in the

2612
01:44:01,280 --> 01:44:03,360
areas of consolidation and that's from

2613
01:44:03,360 --> 01:44:05,520
the top side too as well sometimes it

2614
01:44:05,520 --> 01:44:07,760
happens on on the top side oftentimes

2615
01:44:07,760 --> 01:44:09,920
it's on the bottom side as well but just

2616
01:44:09,920 --> 01:44:11,360
you know pay attention to when that

2617
01:44:11,360 --> 01:44:14,000
happens because it's just a manipulation

2618
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:17,199
of the low before it runs higher

2619
01:44:17,199 --> 01:44:18,719
so um

2620
01:44:18,719 --> 01:44:20,880
you know you also have this area within

2621
01:44:20,880 --> 01:44:22,159
here

2622
01:44:22,159 --> 01:44:24,400
this this s d where it can get rejected

2623
01:44:24,400 --> 01:44:27,600
from right here

2624
01:44:27,600 --> 01:44:30,239
just the zone

2625
01:44:30,239 --> 01:44:32,159
you know it can tap into the zone or it

2626
01:44:32,159 --> 01:44:36,320
could tap into you know um the uh uh the

2627
01:44:36,320 --> 01:44:37,840
candle

2628
01:44:37,840 --> 01:44:39,600
that's here as well

2629
01:44:39,600 --> 01:44:41,760
you know here here

2630
01:44:41,760 --> 01:44:42,880
you know so

2631
01:44:42,880 --> 01:44:45,440
i'm i i try to you know tell people that

2632
01:44:45,440 --> 01:44:47,679
these things happen over and over again

2633
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:50,400
and you could utilize these areas as

2634
01:44:50,400 --> 01:44:53,600
scalps like these are high value areas

2635
01:44:53,600 --> 01:44:55,440
for you to just go in and out of the

2636
01:44:55,440 --> 01:44:58,080
market i don't stay into trades long you

2637
01:44:58,080 --> 01:44:59,679
know sometimes it might be three five

2638
01:44:59,679 --> 01:45:01,199
minutes sometimes

2639
01:45:01,199 --> 01:45:03,280
you know sometimes it could be just a

2640
01:45:03,280 --> 01:45:06,239
couple seconds because you know that

2641
01:45:06,239 --> 01:45:08,159
that reaction

2642
01:45:08,159 --> 01:45:10,159
just happened as a quick reaction and it

2643
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:11,840
just took me in that area like if you

2644
01:45:11,840 --> 01:45:13,440
look here

2645
01:45:13,440 --> 01:45:15,679
if it tapped into my area and and traded

2646
01:45:15,679 --> 01:45:18,000
me away from this area by the time i get

2647
01:45:18,000 --> 01:45:20,239
down to this other smd here let's say i

2648
01:45:20,239 --> 01:45:22,800
held for those what three minutes

2649
01:45:22,800 --> 01:45:24,400
you know it's probably four four or five

2650
01:45:24,400 --> 01:45:26,400
minutes or so um

2651
01:45:26,400 --> 01:45:28,639
but let's say i held for that

2652
01:45:28,639 --> 01:45:30,480
just on a regular lot size that i use

2653
01:45:30,480 --> 01:45:32,800
this is nine thousand dollars

2654
01:45:32,800 --> 01:45:34,560
and i'm outta here three minutes nine

2655
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:36,320
thousand dollars i think i sent uh

2656
01:45:36,320 --> 01:45:38,560
somebody on the chat i'm doing out him

2657
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:41,119
but i sent him you know uh one of the

2658
01:45:41,119 --> 01:45:43,440
the trades um that i took

2659
01:45:43,440 --> 01:45:45,440
and i showed him that within three

2660
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:47,119
minutes i don't know why this is here

2661
01:45:47,119 --> 01:45:48,639
what what is this doing here did i place

2662
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:49,760
that there

2663
01:45:49,760 --> 01:45:51,679
i did not mean to place that there oh no

2664
01:45:51,679 --> 01:45:55,280
i moved it out the way um so yeah it

2665
01:45:55,280 --> 01:45:56,400
with the

2666
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:58,800
the trade that i showed him it was

2667
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:00,239
you know in three minutes it was six

2668
01:46:00,239 --> 01:46:03,040
thousand dollars in three minutes

2669
01:46:03,040 --> 01:46:04,400
you know like i don't know anybody that

2670
01:46:04,400 --> 01:46:06,560
has that type of

2671
01:46:06,560 --> 01:46:08,320
you know uh

2672
01:46:08,320 --> 01:46:10,400
minute salary or hourly salary or

2673
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,239
anything like that the most i know

2674
01:46:12,239 --> 01:46:14,480
people making is like 300 an hour

2675
01:46:14,480 --> 01:46:16,000
sometimes if you're a great lawyer

2676
01:46:16,000 --> 01:46:18,159
you're like a thousand dollars an hour

2677
01:46:18,159 --> 01:46:19,280
you know but

2678
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:21,520
even that becomes child play child's

2679
01:46:21,520 --> 01:46:22,560
play

2680
01:46:22,560 --> 01:46:24,320
compared to this so let's see you you

2681
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:26,560
took you you had to tap on this line

2682
01:46:26,560 --> 01:46:29,440
here you push down all the way to this

2683
01:46:29,440 --> 01:46:31,040
area here

2684
01:46:31,040 --> 01:46:34,719
31 pips just on the top of that line

2685
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:36,800
with 31 pips

2686
01:46:36,800 --> 01:46:39,440
and this is one candle

2687
01:46:39,440 --> 01:46:41,199
on my last size this is just three three

2688
01:46:41,199 --> 01:46:44,239
thousand dollars on one candle

2689
01:46:44,239 --> 01:46:45,840
this could be thirty dollars for someone

2690
01:46:45,840 --> 01:46:48,400
else this could be

2691
01:46:48,400 --> 01:46:49,840
you know three hundred dollars for

2692
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,679
someone else

2693
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:53,199
and whether it's three hundred dollars

2694
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:55,040
whether it's thirty dollars that was in

2695
01:46:55,040 --> 01:46:56,880
one minute

2696
01:46:56,880 --> 01:46:58,560
one minute

2697
01:46:58,560 --> 01:47:00,960
which you have i don't know why this is

2698
01:47:00,960 --> 01:47:03,520
here what what exactly is uh is this the

2699
01:47:03,520 --> 01:47:06,400
imbalance that i drew

2700
01:47:07,199 --> 01:47:08,960
yeah yeah i think this is the imbalance

2701
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,040
that i drew yeah so

2702
01:47:11,040 --> 01:47:13,119
that that could be thirty dollars in in

2703
01:47:13,119 --> 01:47:14,400
one minute

2704
01:47:14,400 --> 01:47:15,520
most people

2705
01:47:15,520 --> 01:47:17,920
that i know are we're not even most

2706
01:47:17,920 --> 01:47:19,360
people that i know are not making thirty

2707
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:21,840
dollars an hour

2708
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:24,000
an hour

2709
01:47:24,000 --> 01:47:25,679
and we're talking about your ability to

2710
01:47:25,679 --> 01:47:29,119
make it in a minute

2711
01:47:30,239 --> 01:47:33,040
that just off of these these little

2712
01:47:33,040 --> 01:47:35,280
you know high value moves

2713
01:47:35,280 --> 01:47:37,920
these little optimal moves

2714
01:47:37,920 --> 01:47:39,520
just off of that let's say we get

2715
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:41,600
another scalp down here

2716
01:47:41,600 --> 01:47:42,560
look at

2717
01:47:42,560 --> 01:47:44,239
25 pips

2718
01:47:44,239 --> 01:47:46,560
just off of rejecting out of this

2719
01:47:46,560 --> 01:47:49,199
imbalance

2720
01:47:49,280 --> 01:47:51,199
25 pips

2721
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:54,000
just over rejecting from there

2722
01:47:54,000 --> 01:47:56,320
i'm out bam

2723
01:47:56,320 --> 01:47:58,080
because i know what

2724
01:47:58,080 --> 01:48:00,159
it tapped this imbalance there was an

2725
01:48:00,159 --> 01:48:02,239
imbalance that was down here

2726
01:48:02,239 --> 01:48:04,560
and it came back to quickly fill that

2727
01:48:04,560 --> 01:48:05,920
imbalance

2728
01:48:05,920 --> 01:48:08,560
and then left

2729
01:48:08,639 --> 01:48:10,960
so if i had that in my mind and i saw it

2730
01:48:10,960 --> 01:48:12,239
when it happened

2731
01:48:12,239 --> 01:48:15,760
quick scalp i'm additive sayonara

2732
01:48:15,760 --> 01:48:17,040
and then remember what i mentioned about

2733
01:48:17,040 --> 01:48:19,199
this candlestick pattern here

2734
01:48:19,199 --> 01:48:21,199
where sometimes you have a run of the

2735
01:48:21,199 --> 01:48:23,440
high up here and then you have a short

2736
01:48:23,440 --> 01:48:25,040
coming out of the area

2737
01:48:25,040 --> 01:48:26,560
that's what you want to see sometimes

2738
01:48:26,560 --> 01:48:28,320
when you're grabbing these quick scalps

2739
01:48:28,320 --> 01:48:29,520
as well

2740
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:31,119
if you're not comfortable with just the

2741
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:32,480
touch of the line

2742
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,320
then you can just wait until you see

2743
01:48:34,320 --> 01:48:37,119
that flick up above the wick here and

2744
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:39,520
then trade below and if you waited on

2745
01:48:39,520 --> 01:48:41,520
that

2746
01:48:41,520 --> 01:48:44,480
you could have also had

2747
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:47,520
33 pips

2748
01:48:47,520 --> 01:48:49,600
now if you understand that the numbers

2749
01:48:49,600 --> 01:48:51,840
that i'm using and and how all of this

2750
01:48:51,840 --> 01:48:53,280
is happening back to back to back to

2751
01:48:53,280 --> 01:48:55,040
back to back to back to back in real

2752
01:48:55,040 --> 01:48:56,080
time

2753
01:48:56,080 --> 01:48:58,400
in real time

2754
01:48:58,400 --> 01:49:00,560
you understand the richness

2755
01:49:00,560 --> 01:49:02,080
and the value

2756
01:49:02,080 --> 01:49:03,840
of this information

2757
01:49:03,840 --> 01:49:06,159
because this is just in real time mind

2758
01:49:06,159 --> 01:49:08,560
you this is an imbalance tap

2759
01:49:08,560 --> 01:49:10,320
look at where it's going look at how

2760
01:49:10,320 --> 01:49:11,679
it's falling

2761
01:49:11,679 --> 01:49:15,360
just from this imbalance alone

2762
01:49:15,360 --> 01:49:17,679
quickly saw that

2763
01:49:17,679 --> 01:49:20,159
quickly

2764
01:49:20,320 --> 01:49:21,920
saw the little candlestick pattern i

2765
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:24,159
liked to happen and then we shorted out

2766
01:49:24,159 --> 01:49:26,480
of the area

2767
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:29,119
was this two minutes

2768
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:31,199
60 something pips in two minutes

2769
01:49:31,199 --> 01:49:32,800
six thousand dollars in two minutes six

2770
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:34,480
hundred dollars in two minutes sixty

2771
01:49:34,480 --> 01:49:36,719
dollars in two minutes after you already

2772
01:49:36,719 --> 01:49:40,760
got thirty dollars here

2773
01:49:42,080 --> 01:49:43,679
and now you have 90 bucks in three

2774
01:49:43,679 --> 01:49:46,080
minutes

2775
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:50,080
on a regular one lot

2776
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:52,800
and and drawdown where

2777
01:49:52,800 --> 01:49:53,679
what

2778
01:49:53,679 --> 01:49:56,920
what drawdown

2779
01:49:57,280 --> 01:49:58,880
so this is why i want you guys to pay

2780
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:01,199
attention to this because this is very

2781
01:50:01,199 --> 01:50:04,719
very real information that could

2782
01:50:04,719 --> 01:50:05,760
like

2783
01:50:05,760 --> 01:50:09,280
radically change the way that you trade

2784
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:13,199
radically transform your life

2785
01:50:13,199 --> 01:50:14,480
to

2786
01:50:14,480 --> 01:50:16,880
you know maybe

2787
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,119
trying to get out of a particular job or

2788
01:50:19,119 --> 01:50:22,639
position to now being able to

2789
01:50:22,639 --> 01:50:24,719
like create your own life create your

2790
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,199
own routine daily

2791
01:50:27,199 --> 01:50:28,560
this is what

2792
01:50:28,560 --> 01:50:31,040
being able to master this and understand

2793
01:50:31,040 --> 01:50:32,080
this

2794
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:35,040
this is what this affords you

2795
01:50:35,040 --> 01:50:38,000
this opportunity it affords you this

2796
01:50:38,000 --> 01:50:40,800
that you're able to work in a manner in

2797
01:50:40,800 --> 01:50:42,880
which you're very efficient within a

2798
01:50:42,880 --> 01:50:44,880
small area look at look at how long it's

2799
01:50:44,880 --> 01:50:47,199
been when did we come on stream

2800
01:50:47,199 --> 01:50:52,000
uh 10 maybe so i'll say right here

2801
01:50:52,000 --> 01:50:54,320
between 10

2802
01:50:54,320 --> 01:50:56,480
and 12 o'clock

2803
01:50:56,480 --> 01:50:57,920
so we've been on we've been on for two

2804
01:50:57,920 --> 01:51:01,520
hours hour and 50 minutes so so between

2805
01:51:01,520 --> 01:51:04,480
like within an hour and 50 minutes

2806
01:51:04,480 --> 01:51:06,639
look at how many trades

2807
01:51:06,639 --> 01:51:09,280
we were able to see

2808
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:11,440
and and understand like

2809
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,920
where price is tapping and and what's

2810
01:51:13,920 --> 01:51:16,000
particularly happening all of this over

2811
01:51:16,000 --> 01:51:17,760
here i have mentioned

2812
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:19,199
you know that i saw all of this

2813
01:51:19,199 --> 01:51:21,440
happening in real time and you know i

2814
01:51:21,440 --> 01:51:23,679
have i had a little markup for it when i

2815
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:26,800
initially came on um for you guys but

2816
01:51:26,800 --> 01:51:29,040
even within here i mentioned you have a

2817
01:51:29,040 --> 01:51:31,440
top of the area trade away you can tap

2818
01:51:31,440 --> 01:51:32,960
into the middle of the area and also

2819
01:51:32,960 --> 01:51:34,719
have another trade away but then you

2820
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:36,960
tapped into this area and now you had a

2821
01:51:36,960 --> 01:51:38,639
long up here

2822
01:51:38,639 --> 01:51:41,280
then we took the high of this

2823
01:51:41,280 --> 01:51:43,679
this uh s and d so it gave us some

2824
01:51:43,679 --> 01:51:45,199
indication that it could potentially

2825
01:51:45,199 --> 01:51:48,719
trade higher because a body closed above

2826
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,159
where did we go

2827
01:51:50,159 --> 01:51:53,040
we came down into this area

2828
01:51:53,040 --> 01:51:56,239
we tapped here for reasons i'm not sure

2829
01:51:56,239 --> 01:51:58,239
oh the the fractal we mentioned the

2830
01:51:58,239 --> 01:52:00,800
fractal was here so we tapped into this

2831
01:52:00,800 --> 01:52:03,440
area and then we pushed further above we

2832
01:52:03,440 --> 01:52:06,000
know we were going above this area here

2833
01:52:06,000 --> 01:52:08,080
because we had already closed the body

2834
01:52:08,080 --> 01:52:10,080
had already closed above so when we

2835
01:52:10,080 --> 01:52:13,280
pushed up to this area we talked about

2836
01:52:13,280 --> 01:52:14,960
potential areas where the price could

2837
01:52:14,960 --> 01:52:17,440
react from whether it was this line here

2838
01:52:17,440 --> 01:52:19,920
or this area above i said it could it

2839
01:52:19,920 --> 01:52:22,880
could react from just the candle or the

2840
01:52:22,880 --> 01:52:24,159
zone

2841
01:52:24,159 --> 01:52:26,400
we got a reaction from the zone

2842
01:52:26,400 --> 01:52:28,719
took us all the way back down here we

2843
01:52:28,719 --> 01:52:31,040
talked about the fake snd

2844
01:52:31,040 --> 01:52:32,480
we talked about

2845
01:52:32,480 --> 01:52:34,560
this area here where price could

2846
01:52:34,560 --> 01:52:36,880
potentially find some support on

2847
01:52:36,880 --> 01:52:37,599
but

2848
01:52:37,599 --> 01:52:39,760
then we mentioned that there was an

2849
01:52:39,760 --> 01:52:41,920
imbalance in between here and

2850
01:52:41,920 --> 01:52:44,560
potentially a fractal where price can

2851
01:52:44,560 --> 01:52:46,320
react from

2852
01:52:46,320 --> 01:52:48,239
so we had to trade away i told you if

2853
01:52:48,239 --> 01:52:50,960
you were in a short it's fine because

2854
01:52:50,960 --> 01:52:52,480
it's not giving you any indication that

2855
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:54,719
it's flipping bullish so we tap into

2856
01:52:54,719 --> 01:52:56,000
this area

2857
01:52:56,000 --> 01:52:58,159
then we say okay there was an imbalance

2858
01:52:58,159 --> 01:53:00,000
here i have mentioned it this before it

2859
01:53:00,000 --> 01:53:02,159
even got here there's an imbalance here

2860
01:53:02,159 --> 01:53:04,639
price comes tap into the imbalance give

2861
01:53:04,639 --> 01:53:07,199
you a quick backup for a quick you know

2862
01:53:07,199 --> 01:53:10,080
um trade back up so you go from

2863
01:53:10,080 --> 01:53:13,119
imbalance to imbalance

2864
01:53:13,119 --> 01:53:15,599
you shift below you see we quickly run

2865
01:53:15,599 --> 01:53:18,320
the low and trade away from it

2866
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:19,840
now we're looking where can we get

2867
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,800
involved price is pushing up here

2868
01:53:22,800 --> 01:53:24,560
maybe you didn't get into the trade you

2869
01:53:24,560 --> 01:53:27,440
don't want to chase you get a reaction

2870
01:53:27,440 --> 01:53:31,040
out of this s and d back down into this

2871
01:53:31,040 --> 01:53:33,920
about 30 40 pips or so then we go up

2872
01:53:33,920 --> 01:53:36,480
into the imbalance up here

2873
01:53:36,480 --> 01:53:38,239
what did we do with the imbalance here

2874
01:53:38,239 --> 01:53:42,080
we tapped into it we traded away from it

2875
01:53:42,080 --> 01:53:44,400
where do we trade from imbalance to

2876
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:45,920
imbalance

2877
01:53:45,920 --> 01:53:47,840
price comes back up

2878
01:53:47,840 --> 01:53:50,800
what do we have here

2879
01:53:50,800 --> 01:53:52,560
and i'm not saying use

2880
01:53:52,560 --> 01:53:54,639
imbalance for direction because

2881
01:53:54,639 --> 01:53:56,800
sometimes price doesn't always go back

2882
01:53:56,800 --> 01:53:59,199
to the imbalance right away

2883
01:53:59,199 --> 01:54:02,320
but the imbalances can be very helpful

2884
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:04,960
so if you look here

2885
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:07,440
there's an imbalance here price taps

2886
01:54:07,440 --> 01:54:09,760
into the area doesn't come to the 50 of

2887
01:54:09,760 --> 01:54:10,480
it

2888
01:54:10,480 --> 01:54:12,880
but then it trades away and it runs the

2889
01:54:12,880 --> 01:54:14,320
low

2890
01:54:14,320 --> 01:54:16,400
you know so if if if you're even

2891
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,480
understanding that that according to

2892
01:54:18,480 --> 01:54:20,159
candlestick structure

2893
01:54:20,159 --> 01:54:23,560
this is making

2894
01:54:24,320 --> 01:54:26,320
you know higher

2895
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:29,520
highs higher lows higher highs we run

2896
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:31,760
the low we come back into the middle of

2897
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:33,599
the area here

2898
01:54:33,599 --> 01:54:36,719
and then we trade below it

2899
01:54:36,719 --> 01:54:39,280
our first target is the low and possibly

2900
01:54:39,280 --> 01:54:41,679
coming further down this is

2901
01:54:41,679 --> 01:54:43,760
so this is gathering

2902
01:54:43,760 --> 01:54:45,199
imbalance

2903
01:54:45,199 --> 01:54:47,599
um what was it it was imbalance that we

2904
01:54:47,599 --> 01:54:50,320
mentioned we mentioned displacement we

2905
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,880
mentioned you know protected highs and

2906
01:54:52,880 --> 01:54:56,080
lows so this is structure that creates

2907
01:54:56,080 --> 01:54:58,159
these protected highs and lows we talked

2908
01:54:58,159 --> 01:55:00,400
about equal highs if equal highs are

2909
01:55:00,400 --> 01:55:02,719
made then we could potentially run at

2910
01:55:02,719 --> 01:55:04,960
least one of the lows if not the second

2911
01:55:04,960 --> 01:55:07,440
low we talked like come on imbalance to

2912
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:10,080
imbalance target to target like

2913
01:55:10,080 --> 01:55:11,599
all of these different things that we're

2914
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:15,040
discussing in this one video

2915
01:55:15,040 --> 01:55:18,000
this one video and you can go back to it

2916
01:55:18,000 --> 01:55:20,560
and play it over and over and over again

2917
01:55:20,560 --> 01:55:23,360
and you can have your chart side by side

2918
01:55:23,360 --> 01:55:25,760
and you could actually see it on your

2919
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,920
chart too it's something that you can go

2920
01:55:27,920 --> 01:55:29,440
back and test

2921
01:55:29,440 --> 01:55:30,960
it's factual

2922
01:55:30,960 --> 01:55:32,960
you can go back and test it i'm not i'm

2923
01:55:32,960 --> 01:55:35,360
not creating some small segment of a

2924
01:55:35,360 --> 01:55:37,199
video and telling you guys yeah if you

2925
01:55:37,199 --> 01:55:38,560
go back and look for this you know you

2926
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:40,719
throw the fib to this high and this low

2927
01:55:40,719 --> 01:55:43,360
and it hit bam

2928
01:55:43,360 --> 01:55:46,639
and that hit was only one of the thirty

2929
01:55:46,639 --> 01:55:50,080
percent of the time that that happens

2930
01:55:50,080 --> 01:55:52,159
and everybody's thinking oh my gosh this

2931
01:55:52,159 --> 01:55:55,040
guy can trade wow so amazing

2932
01:55:55,040 --> 01:55:56,960
no

2933
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:58,480
no

2934
01:55:58,480 --> 01:56:01,840
it's it's

2935
01:56:02,080 --> 01:56:04,159
it's just not a thing

2936
01:56:04,159 --> 01:56:06,960
that's not the way that that people are

2937
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:08,560
supposed to be teaching that's not the

2938
01:56:08,560 --> 01:56:09,760
way that people are supposed to be

2939
01:56:09,760 --> 01:56:11,760
trading and this is why i do these

2940
01:56:11,760 --> 01:56:13,760
long-winded streams i get it it's very

2941
01:56:13,760 --> 01:56:16,000
long for some people to go back and

2942
01:56:16,000 --> 01:56:17,920
and watch because sometimes i go into my

2943
01:56:17,920 --> 01:56:19,520
little you know

2944
01:56:19,520 --> 01:56:21,760
rants and conspiracies and blah blah

2945
01:56:21,760 --> 01:56:23,040
blah but

2946
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:26,400
it's still accurate information

2947
01:56:26,400 --> 01:56:29,360
accurate information that you could use

2948
01:56:29,360 --> 01:56:32,159
to further your trading

2949
01:56:32,159 --> 01:56:36,800
very very highly accurate information

2950
01:56:36,800 --> 01:56:39,440
and and if you get this in real time

2951
01:56:39,440 --> 01:56:40,880
then

2952
01:56:40,880 --> 01:56:43,040
you know that would be even more

2953
01:56:43,040 --> 01:56:45,679
priceless

2954
01:56:45,679 --> 01:56:49,280
to be able to have that in real time

2955
01:56:49,280 --> 01:56:51,440
because there's so many ways to approach

2956
01:56:51,440 --> 01:56:54,080
this particular trade here

2957
01:56:54,080 --> 01:56:55,440
because you see how i mentioned the

2958
01:56:55,440 --> 01:56:56,639
imbalance

2959
01:56:56,639 --> 01:56:58,320
now let's say i took

2960
01:56:58,320 --> 01:57:02,320
the high and the low of that area

2961
01:57:03,679 --> 01:57:06,000
i tap up into this i'm in a little bit

2962
01:57:06,000 --> 01:57:08,719
of drawdown

2963
01:57:09,520 --> 01:57:10,800
right here i'm in a little bit of

2964
01:57:10,800 --> 01:57:12,960
drawdown

2965
01:57:12,960 --> 01:57:15,280
you know 30 pip drawdown

2966
01:57:15,280 --> 01:57:18,480
but then we push out of the area

2967
01:57:18,480 --> 01:57:19,920
and

2968
01:57:19,920 --> 01:57:21,840
you know we're we're further into the

2969
01:57:21,840 --> 01:57:23,760
lower parts of the area so if i wanted

2970
01:57:23,760 --> 01:57:26,159
to use that i could

2971
01:57:26,159 --> 01:57:28,800
but you have to remember that

2972
01:57:28,800 --> 01:57:30,000
for me

2973
01:57:30,000 --> 01:57:31,599
i mean i say it all the time here on the

2974
01:57:31,599 --> 01:57:32,560
channel

2975
01:57:32,560 --> 01:57:36,320
i absolutely hate drawdown

2976
01:57:36,320 --> 01:57:39,920
like i hate it so much with everything

2977
01:57:39,920 --> 01:57:41,760
within me i

2978
01:57:41,760 --> 01:57:45,520
detest i'm disgusted by drawdown i do

2979
01:57:45,520 --> 01:57:48,400
not like drawdown at all and that's how

2980
01:57:48,400 --> 01:57:50,239
i learned to become so efficient with

2981
01:57:50,239 --> 01:57:51,520
trading

2982
01:57:51,520 --> 01:57:54,000
because of my disdain for drawdown

2983
01:57:54,000 --> 01:57:56,800
my disdain for losing i i'm not a sore

2984
01:57:56,800 --> 01:57:58,400
loser but

2985
01:57:58,400 --> 01:58:00,320
i like to perfect what it is that i'm

2986
01:58:00,320 --> 01:58:01,280
doing

2987
01:58:01,280 --> 01:58:02,080
so

2988
01:58:02,080 --> 01:58:04,159
that's how i was able to

2989
01:58:04,159 --> 01:58:06,800
you know start to learn this at within

2990
01:58:06,800 --> 01:58:08,960
such a short time

2991
01:58:08,960 --> 01:58:10,880
such a short time

2992
01:58:10,880 --> 01:58:13,360
people take years to become profitable i

2993
01:58:13,360 --> 01:58:15,280
don't believe in that you don't need

2994
01:58:15,280 --> 01:58:16,719
years to become profitable with the

2995
01:58:16,719 --> 01:58:18,719

were just taking these trades from these

3025
01:59:22,400 --> 01:59:25,760
high probability areas that i discuss

3026
01:59:25,760 --> 01:59:28,080
look at this

3027
01:59:28,080 --> 01:59:32,159
this is a and five pips down

3028
01:59:32,159 --> 01:59:34,480
just from the top of this area and while

3029
01:59:34,480 --> 01:59:37,280
i'm just being loquacious and talking

3030
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:39,280
105 pips down

3031
01:59:39,280 --> 01:59:41,040
six whatever you want to call it if

3032
01:59:41,040 --> 01:59:42,960
you're technical

3033
01:59:42,960 --> 01:59:46,639
and this is within nine minutes

3034
01:59:46,639 --> 01:59:48,080
so come on man

3035
01:59:48,080 --> 01:59:51,520
you made a hundred bucks

3036
01:59:51,520 --> 01:59:53,679
in in ten minutes

3037
01:59:53,679 --> 01:59:56,840
a hundred dollars in ten minutes

3038
01:59:56,840 --> 02:00:00,159
when most lawyers i know as i mentioned

3039
02:00:00,159 --> 02:00:02,880
their salary is 300 an hour

3040
02:00:02,880 --> 02:00:04,800
and you made that in 10 minutes

3041
02:00:04,800 --> 02:00:06,719
and some people make that in a days of

3042
02:00:06,719 --> 02:00:07,840
work

3043
02:00:07,840 --> 02:00:10,159
or or four hours of work

3044
02:00:10,159 --> 02:00:11,679
you know if if they're getting paid

3045
02:00:11,679 --> 02:00:14,159
pretty well

3046
02:00:14,400 --> 02:00:17,520
but this this changes the trajectory of

3047
02:00:17,520 --> 02:00:18,719
just

3048
02:00:18,719 --> 02:00:20,310
you being able to

3049
02:00:20,310 --> 02:00:21,520
[Music]

3050
02:00:21,520 --> 02:00:23,679
to like

3051
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:25,679

investing to making it your lifestyle

3053
02:00:29,760 --> 02:00:32,719
because now you understand from from

3054
02:00:32,719 --> 02:00:35,440
just a different standpoint

3055
02:00:35,440 --> 02:00:37,440
you understand things and and you're

3056
02:00:37,440 --> 02:00:39,199
able to generate money just with your

3057
02:00:39,199 --> 02:00:41,760
brain what you're thinking

3058
02:00:41,760 --> 02:00:43,760
which you're thinking you're generating

3059
02:00:43,760 --> 02:00:46,080
money

3060
02:00:46,080 --> 02:00:48,880
guess what that is the 61.8 percent of

3061
02:00:48,880 --> 02:00:52,000
the range right in the imbalance exactly

3062
02:00:52,000 --> 02:00:53,520
and this is what i'm saying there's so

3063
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:54,400

02:03:35,280 --> 02:03:36,960
else's hand

3138
02:03:36,960 --> 02:03:40,639
because absolute power

3139
02:03:40,840 --> 02:03:42,480
corrupts

3140
02:03:42,480 --> 02:03:44,960
it really does corrupt

3141
02:03:44,960 --> 02:03:48,639
absolute power corrupts

3142
02:03:48,639 --> 02:03:50,880
you know like if you have the ability or

3143
02:03:50,880 --> 02:03:53,760
the advantage to to

3144
02:03:53,760 --> 02:03:56,639
like get into to whatever it is and you

3145
02:03:56,639 --> 02:04:00,079
have total control over it

3146
02:04:00,079 --> 02:04:02,159
it can corrupt

3147
02:04:02,159 --> 02:04:06,159
it's very very real it can corrupt

3148
02:04:06,159 --> 02:04:08,079
you know and and people don't understand

3149
02:04:08,079 --> 02:04:09,679
that but it's

3150
02:04:09,679 --> 02:04:11,119
it's the truth behind it and that's why

3151
02:04:11,119 --> 02:04:13,040
we have these jobs that we we end up in

3152
02:04:13,040 --> 02:04:15,040
these situations where things start off

3153
02:04:15,040 --> 02:04:16,960
great and then

3154
02:04:16,960 --> 02:04:19,679
it's like they understand that that

3155
02:04:19,679 --> 02:04:21,440
you need the job to feed your kids so

3156
02:04:21,440 --> 02:04:22,800
what do they do

3157
02:04:22,800 --> 02:04:26,079
they your humanity now

3158
02:04:26,079 --> 02:04:27,040
is

3159
02:04:27,040 --> 02:04:28,880
that they know you need them more than

3160
02:04:28,880 --> 02:04:31,440
they need you

3161
02:04:31,440 --> 02:04:34,560
and they begin to treat things that way

3162
02:04:34,560 --> 02:04:37,360
they begin to treat you that way started

3163
02:04:37,360 --> 02:04:39,599
off great but now it feels like a

3164
02:04:39,599 --> 02:04:41,679
horrible environment to be in but you

3165
02:04:41,679 --> 02:04:43,920
know your kids depend on it so you gotta

3166
02:04:43,920 --> 02:04:46,239
put up with it why don't i take that

3167
02:04:46,239 --> 02:04:47,920
type of stress

3168
02:04:47,920 --> 02:04:50,159
and put it in the markets

3169
02:04:50,159 --> 02:04:51,840
let the markets give me that stress when

3170
02:04:51,840 --> 02:04:52,960
i'm learning

3171
02:04:52,960 --> 02:04:56,480
it stresses me out enough

3172
02:04:57,679 --> 02:05:00,000
my kid is over at copying me while i'm

3173
02:05:00,000 --> 02:05:01,920
talking to you guys

3174
02:05:01,920 --> 02:05:03,599
but yes

3175
02:05:03,599 --> 02:05:06,960
why why not do that look so you see how

3176
02:05:06,960 --> 02:05:10,159
i put this line here and i mentioned

3177
02:05:10,159 --> 02:05:12,960
look at this 23 pips off the top of this

3178
02:05:12,960 --> 02:05:14,560
alone

3179
02:05:14,560 --> 02:05:17,520
off the top of this alone

3180
02:05:17,520 --> 02:05:20,159
23 pips i told you guys i just need 24

3181
02:05:20,159 --> 02:05:21,280
for the week

3182
02:05:21,280 --> 02:05:23,280
and i'm good

3183
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:26,159
23 pips

3184
02:05:26,239 --> 02:05:29,760
off that top alone

3185
02:05:29,760 --> 02:05:31,679
and you quick with it

3186
02:05:31,679 --> 02:05:35,520
go in get it out

3187
02:05:35,520 --> 02:05:38,480
and it's all off of principles that you

3188
02:05:38,480 --> 02:05:39,599
have learned

3189
02:05:39,599 --> 02:05:42,000
things that you have seen over time that

3190
02:05:42,000 --> 02:05:43,920
you've seen happen over and over and

3191
02:05:43,920 --> 02:05:45,760
over again i told you whenever you see

3192
02:05:45,760 --> 02:05:47,840
this huge push-up followed by this huge

3193
02:05:47,840 --> 02:05:49,679
push down and you got both candles side

3194
02:05:49,679 --> 02:05:51,599
by side together like this i don't know

3195
02:05:51,599 --> 02:05:53,599
if it's on a lower time frame maybe or

3196
02:05:53,599 --> 02:05:54,960
something like that

3197
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,239
and this is the one minute so it could

3198
02:05:56,239 --> 02:05:59,360
be like on a 15 second or five second

3199
02:05:59,360 --> 02:06:01,360
there's always something in here that

3200
02:06:01,360 --> 02:06:03,840
when price comes up into it you get a

3201
02:06:03,840 --> 02:06:06,480
tap in that area and a rejection out

3202
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:08,719
even if it goes and takes the area you

3203
02:06:08,719 --> 02:06:10,320
still get a rejection from somewhere

3204
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:11,760
within there and it could just be on a

3205
02:06:11,760 --> 02:06:13,199
lower time frame that there's something

3206
02:06:13,199 --> 02:06:15,040
in there that taps into and rejects away

3207
02:06:15,040 --> 02:06:17,040
from the same way we see the rejections

3208
02:06:17,040 --> 02:06:18,719
from you know these different areas that

3209
02:06:18,719 --> 02:06:20,000
we draw

3210
02:06:20,000 --> 02:06:21,760
nonetheless

3211
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,280
you still

3212
02:06:23,280 --> 02:06:25,440
get a reaction from it

3213
02:06:25,440 --> 02:06:27,440
so if if you have this in the back of

3214
02:06:27,440 --> 02:06:28,639
your mind

3215
02:06:28,639 --> 02:06:31,040
quick thinking says yes you can get a

3216
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:32,480
reaction look at it look at it on the

3217
02:06:32,480 --> 02:06:35,520
downside right here

3218
02:06:35,679 --> 02:06:37,360
look at it on the downside

3219
02:06:37,360 --> 02:06:39,119
you have this push down followed by this

3220
02:06:39,119 --> 02:06:40,560
push-up

3221
02:06:40,560 --> 02:06:42,320
price comes back in

3222
02:06:42,320 --> 02:06:45,760
taps into the area and then rejects

3223
02:06:45,760 --> 02:06:47,599
i don't know why this happens i don't

3224
02:06:47,599 --> 02:06:49,520
and usually it's it's it's when the

3225
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:52,719
areas are slim like you have a

3226
02:06:52,719 --> 02:06:55,280
push a push up and then a push down and

3227
02:06:55,280 --> 02:06:57,280
also a trade away from it so there's

3228
02:06:57,280 --> 02:06:59,679
some space around it

3229
02:06:59,679 --> 02:07:01,920
usually you get a push back up into that

3230
02:07:01,920 --> 02:07:03,440
area tap

3231
02:07:03,440 --> 02:07:05,520
quick short out of the area

3232
02:07:05,520 --> 02:07:07,679
quick like that

3233
02:07:07,679 --> 02:07:10,239
so your scalping becomes different your

3234
02:07:10,239 --> 02:07:12,320
scalping is no longer oh i see it

3235
02:07:12,320 --> 02:07:15,119
dropping let me jump in and take it more

3236
02:07:15,119 --> 02:07:17,599
no your scalping is at high probability

3237
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:18,880
areas

3238
02:07:18,880 --> 02:07:20,960
so we always mention

3239
02:07:20,960 --> 02:07:23,280
that when we get a run of the high

3240
02:07:23,280 --> 02:07:26,320
oftentimes we have a pullback

3241
02:07:26,320 --> 02:07:27,920
we also

3242
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:29,679
say that oftentimes

3243
02:07:29,679 --> 02:07:33,440
when you get just a wick above the high

3244
02:07:33,440 --> 02:07:35,360
and then price starts to pull away from

3245
02:07:35,360 --> 02:07:36,159
it

3246
02:07:36,159 --> 02:07:37,520
oftentimes

3247
02:07:37,520 --> 02:07:41,440
that's a quick short out of the area

3248
02:07:41,440 --> 02:07:44,079
so you can get in on a quick scalp

3249
02:07:44,079 --> 02:07:46,800
but you have to make sure

3250
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:47,920
that

3251
02:07:47,920 --> 02:07:50,880
there are targets down below what is the

3252
02:07:50,880 --> 02:07:53,599
target down below for this

3253
02:07:53,599 --> 02:07:55,840
here

3254
02:08:00,079 --> 02:08:04,079
mind blowing information

3255
02:08:04,079 --> 02:08:05,119
mind

3256
02:08:05,119 --> 02:08:07,920
blowing exactly it's an ict order block

3257
02:08:07,920 --> 02:08:09,920
on the seconds time frame

3258
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:13,760
but mind-blowing information

3259
02:08:13,760 --> 02:08:15,440
mind-blowing why

3260
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:18,639
look at this tap into this area

3261
02:08:18,639 --> 02:08:21,119
this one did not touch it

3262
02:08:21,119 --> 02:08:22,480
price went up

3263
02:08:22,480 --> 02:08:25,280
and came back to this area

3264
02:08:25,280 --> 02:08:29,760
tapped this area exactly

3265
02:08:30,719 --> 02:08:31,920
look at this

3266
02:08:31,920 --> 02:08:34,000
three pip three pips

3267
02:08:34,000 --> 02:08:37,599
draw down what touches this area and

3268
02:08:37,599 --> 02:08:40,000
pushes back up

3269
02:08:40,000 --> 02:08:42,560
42 pips

3270
02:08:42,560 --> 02:08:45,280
in two minutes

3271
02:08:45,280 --> 02:08:48,840
and i teach this stuff for free i i

3272
02:08:48,840 --> 02:08:52,000
i and if you go through my videos go

3273
02:08:52,000 --> 02:08:54,000
through the stuff that that that i have

3274
02:08:54,000 --> 02:08:55,199
placed there

3275
02:08:55,199 --> 02:08:57,840
you guys will see

3276
02:08:57,840 --> 02:09:00,880
that this stuff happens over and over

3277
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:04,000
and over and over and over and over

3278
02:09:04,000 --> 02:09:04,880
again

3279
02:09:04,880 --> 02:09:07,840
bear market bull market over and over

3280
02:09:07,840 --> 02:09:09,920
and over again

3281
02:09:09,920 --> 02:09:12,239
over and over again

3282
02:09:12,239 --> 02:09:14,079
this could potentially be white golf

3283
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:15,679
happening

3284
02:09:15,679 --> 02:09:17,280
right here

3285
02:09:17,280 --> 02:09:19,920
this could potentially be like off

3286
02:09:19,920 --> 02:09:22,960
you can get a dip into this area a tap

3287
02:09:22,960 --> 02:09:25,199
here or even a dip below it to tap this

3288
02:09:25,199 --> 02:09:27,679
line you know maybe just go below it

3289
02:09:27,679 --> 02:09:29,360
then i'm push back up

3290
02:09:29,360 --> 02:09:30,320
above

3291
02:09:30,320 --> 02:09:32,960
this here

3292
02:09:32,960 --> 02:09:34,639
904

3293
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:36,480
if it taps below this you could get a

3294
02:09:36,480 --> 02:09:39,440
push back up above 904

3295
02:09:39,440 --> 02:09:40,639
and then

3296
02:09:40,639 --> 02:09:43,520
you might get another dip further into

3297
02:09:43,520 --> 02:09:45,119
these areas

3298
02:09:45,119 --> 02:09:47,440
before potentially going long out of the

3299
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:49,280
area

3300
02:09:49,280 --> 02:09:51,360
but this is the area that

3301
02:09:51,360 --> 02:09:52,960
price traded out of when the market

3302
02:09:52,960 --> 02:09:54,560
opened

3303
02:09:54,560 --> 02:09:56,880
so we had some falling

3304
02:09:56,880 --> 02:09:58,719
we had price come back up to the area

3305
02:09:58,719 --> 02:10:01,440
and get rejected we could very well be

3306
02:10:01,440 --> 02:10:02,800
looking to

3307
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:05,119
run this low overall

3308
02:10:05,119 --> 02:10:07,599
so whoever was in this short from here

3309
02:10:07,599 --> 02:10:10,000
they're still seeing that you know price

3310
02:10:10,000 --> 02:10:13,520
made its way up here put in a high

3311
02:10:13,520 --> 02:10:15,199
put in a low

3312
02:10:15,199 --> 02:10:17,280
ran the low

3313
02:10:17,280 --> 02:10:19,119
now is looking to potentially put in

3314
02:10:19,119 --> 02:10:20,639
another high

3315
02:10:20,639 --> 02:10:22,960
maybe within these areas

3316
02:10:22,960 --> 02:10:26,320
and then ultimately put in another low

3317
02:10:26,320 --> 02:10:28,800
so you're so fine if you if you were in

3318
02:10:28,800 --> 02:10:31,360
from up here and you you've got this top

3319
02:10:31,360 --> 02:10:33,599
like i said some of these taps can turn

3320
02:10:33,599 --> 02:10:35,920
into longer moves

3321
02:10:35,920 --> 02:10:37,840
some of these scalps can turn into

3322
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:39,920
longer moves depending on how fast they

3323
02:10:39,920 --> 02:10:42,400
trade away and they don't come back

3324
02:10:42,400 --> 02:10:45,280
some of them can turn into longer moves

3325
02:10:45,280 --> 02:10:47,040
and it's just using these these high

3326
02:10:47,040 --> 02:10:51,040
probability areas these optimal zones

3327
02:10:51,040 --> 02:10:53,599
just using that alone

3328
02:10:53,599 --> 02:10:55,440
and once you once you're able to use

3329
02:10:55,440 --> 02:10:58,159
that and trade from that you start to

3330
02:10:58,159 --> 02:10:59,760
see things differently and this is why i

3331
02:10:59,760 --> 02:11:03,199
want to do a zoom soon of just teaching

3332
02:11:03,199 --> 02:11:04,320
zones

3333
02:11:04,320 --> 02:11:06,800
only zones i teach a bunch of stuff here

3334
02:11:06,800 --> 02:11:08,880
i teach zones i teach candlestick

3335
02:11:08,880 --> 02:11:11,760
structure i teach how to find an entry

3336
02:11:11,760 --> 02:11:13,360
you know what you're looking for when

3337
02:11:13,360 --> 02:11:15,520
price you know moves out of a particular

3338
02:11:15,520 --> 02:11:18,880
area so when it grabs a high usually

3339
02:11:18,880 --> 02:11:21,520
dips back into the area and if it finds

3340
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:23,119
some support within that area

3341
02:11:23,119 --> 02:11:26,800
potentially runs the the other high that

3342
02:11:26,800 --> 02:11:28,560
that ran the previous high sometimes

3343
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,320
that can happen so there's a bunch of

3344
02:11:30,320 --> 02:11:32,239
stuff i teach liquidity you know trend

3345
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:34,719
line liquidity and like there's so much

3346
02:11:34,719 --> 02:11:37,119
that i teach on this channel is crazy um

3347
02:11:37,119 --> 02:11:40,000
but jones it seems like zones is

3348
02:11:40,000 --> 02:11:41,199
something that

3349
02:11:41,199 --> 02:11:42,159
that

3350
02:11:42,159 --> 02:11:43,679
or zones can be something that people

3351
02:11:43,679 --> 02:11:46,239
have the most difficulty with

3352
02:11:46,239 --> 02:11:47,679
so people are understanding the

3353
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:50,079
candlestick structure that i talk about

3354
02:11:50,079 --> 02:11:53,040
here like this this is literally it

3355
02:11:53,040 --> 02:11:55,119
i i taught this on the the may 13th

3356
02:11:55,119 --> 02:11:56,639
video and i think the june second and

3357
02:11:56,639 --> 02:11:59,119
third video let me go back and make sure

3358
02:11:59,119 --> 02:12:01,920
june 2nd and 3rd is correct instead of

3359
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:03,840
like hoping that it's not a weekend yeah

3360
02:12:03,840 --> 02:12:05,520
yeah thursday and friday

3361
02:12:05,520 --> 02:12:06,400
yeah

3362
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:07,440
so

3363
02:12:07,440 --> 02:12:09,840
so i um i taught on on those videos the

3364
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:12,159
the candlestick structure

3365
02:12:12,159 --> 02:12:13,760
and if you look

3366
02:12:13,760 --> 02:12:17,040
the candlestick structure

3367
02:12:17,920 --> 02:12:20,480
is this low put in

3368
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,639
this high put in

3369
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:25,520
this low put in

3370
02:12:25,520 --> 02:12:27,040
we have a run

3371
02:12:27,040 --> 02:12:28,400
of the high

3372
02:12:28,400 --> 02:12:30,800
so anytime we have a run of a high we're

3373
02:12:30,800 --> 02:12:33,920
actually looking for price to trade back

3374
02:12:33,920 --> 02:12:36,159
into the area here

3375
02:12:36,159 --> 02:12:39,199
and then this is where we get in

3376
02:12:39,199 --> 02:12:41,199
to go long

3377
02:12:41,199 --> 02:12:43,679
up here

3378
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:47,280
so if we got in at this area

3379
02:12:47,280 --> 02:12:49,679
we're essentially looking to target the

3380
02:12:49,679 --> 02:12:50,800
high

3381
02:12:50,800 --> 02:12:53,280
but oftentimes you have a second touch

3382
02:12:53,280 --> 02:12:56,400
within the area that can still take you

3383
02:12:56,400 --> 02:12:58,880
up to a higher area to a higher area as

3384
02:12:58,880 --> 02:13:00,000
well

3385
02:13:00,000 --> 02:13:02,000
you tend to have that sometimes i told

3386
02:13:02,000 --> 02:13:04,320
you there's sometimes a um

3387
02:13:04,320 --> 02:13:06,800
like almost like an equal low or a

3388
02:13:06,800 --> 02:13:09,119
double bottom within your area of

3389
02:13:09,119 --> 02:13:11,360
interest so the first one usually is a

3390
02:13:11,360 --> 02:13:14,800
scalp the second one usually is a longer

3391
02:13:14,800 --> 02:13:17,360
trade out of the area

3392
02:13:17,360 --> 02:13:19,840
but both of them you want to see a quick

3393
02:13:19,840 --> 02:13:21,840
pull away from that area and once you

3394
02:13:21,840 --> 02:13:24,239
get that quick pull away from the area

3395
02:13:24,239 --> 02:13:26,800
then you understand that you could be in

3396
02:13:26,800 --> 02:13:29,280
for for a little longer

3397
02:13:29,280 --> 02:13:30,480
you know so

3398
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:32,239
this one here

3399
02:13:32,239 --> 02:13:35,280
we just grab this high here

3400
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:38,800
now with us grabbing this high

3401
02:13:38,800 --> 02:13:40,560
if we closed above it

3402
02:13:40,560 --> 02:13:41,360
then

3403
02:13:41,360 --> 02:13:43,040
that's a good sign

3404
02:13:43,040 --> 02:13:45,599
but if we just grabbed the high and

3405
02:13:45,599 --> 02:13:47,520
quickly traded away from and it was like

3406
02:13:47,520 --> 02:13:50,800
a huge wick you know left here then

3407
02:13:50,800 --> 02:13:53,599
obviously that's something that you know

3408
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:55,520
you don't want to look for price going

3409
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,760
higher look we just got that close above

3410
02:13:57,760 --> 02:14:00,159
and then we

3411
02:14:00,159 --> 02:14:01,920
and then we took out the high here so

3412
02:14:01,920 --> 02:14:03,360
instead if you tap into here you could

3413
02:14:03,360 --> 02:14:04,880
potentially come up and take out the

3414
02:14:04,880 --> 02:14:06,320
high that took out the previous high we

3415
02:14:06,320 --> 02:14:08,000
just watched it all happen just like

3416
02:14:08,000 --> 02:14:09,119
that

3417
02:14:09,119 --> 02:14:10,719
like just now

3418
02:14:10,719 --> 02:14:12,639
you know i hope that people like when

3419
02:14:12,639 --> 02:14:14,880
they listen to what i'm saying even if

3420
02:14:14,880 --> 02:14:16,400
they don't always like agree with a

3421
02:14:16,400 --> 02:14:18,639
hundred percent of it i hope that you

3422
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:20,880
guys can understand that there is

3423
02:14:20,880 --> 02:14:23,679
so much quality

3424
02:14:23,679 --> 02:14:27,119

really want you guys to unders look at

3430
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:41,520
this rejection from this area

3431
02:14:41,520 --> 02:14:43,360
look at this

3432
02:14:43,360 --> 02:14:45,760
like this

3433
02:14:47,599 --> 02:14:50,079
and this has happened so many times on

3434
02:14:50,079 --> 02:14:52,480
stream look at the rejection from this

3435
02:14:52,480 --> 02:14:54,159
area

3436
02:14:54,159 --> 02:14:55,920
within one

3437
02:14:55,920 --> 02:14:57,599
minute

3438

information out to people

3446
02:15:16,960 --> 02:15:19,520

and it wasn't that

3451
02:15:26,079 --> 02:15:29,040
you know you called out a losing trade

3452
02:15:29,040 --> 02:15:32,560
if you just learn how to fine-tune

3453
02:15:32,560 --> 02:15:34,400
what you're doing and you learn how to

3454
02:15:34,400 --> 02:15:36,560
actually analyze the charts

3455
02:15:36,560 --> 02:15:38,719
you can be calling some bangers people

3456
02:15:38,719 --> 02:15:39,920

but you can give people the right

3461
02:15:46,239 --> 02:15:48,159

information this yeah there's people out

here scamming but understand that these

3467
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:01,199
banks scam way more than these people

3468
02:16:01,199 --> 02:16:04,560
these these governments scam way more

3469
02:16:04,560 --> 02:16:06,480
than these people out there scamming for

3470
02:16:06,480 --> 02:16:09,360
a quick buck both of them are wrong

3471
02:16:09,360 --> 02:16:12,480
but the government scams hurt society

3472
02:16:12,480 --> 02:16:15,360
way more than the scams that that some

3473
02:16:15,360 --> 02:16:17,040
of these guys are running some of these

3474
02:16:17,040 --> 02:16:19,119
guys are just trying to survive

3475
02:16:19,119 --> 02:16:20,560
but you don't have to survive giving

3476
02:16:20,560 --> 02:16:22,400
people the wrong information

3477
02:16:22,400 --> 02:16:23,360
you can give people the right

3478
02:16:23,360 --> 02:16:25,440
information too and survive

3479
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:26,800
you know so

3480
02:16:26,800 --> 02:16:28,560
that's just something that

3481
02:16:28,560 --> 02:16:30,840
that i want people to

3482
02:16:30,840 --> 02:16:33,439
understand you know like i really want

3483
02:16:33,439 --> 02:16:35,359
people to to

3484
02:16:35,359 --> 02:16:36,638
like get

3485
02:16:36,638 --> 02:16:39,599
get a gist of to understand so look you

3486
02:16:39,599 --> 02:16:42,718
have this area here

3487
02:16:42,718 --> 02:16:44,080
you have this area here and then you

3488
02:16:44,080 --> 02:16:47,120
have another area above

3489
02:16:47,120 --> 02:16:48,160
uh

3490
02:16:48,160 --> 02:16:49,679
here maybe

3491
02:16:49,679 --> 02:16:51,760
no this this looks like this mid this is

3492
02:16:51,760 --> 02:16:54,318
mitigated already

3493
02:16:54,318 --> 02:16:55,840
i think there's a possibility of this

3494
02:16:55,840 --> 02:17:00,000
area being mitigated so just um

3495
02:17:00,000 --> 02:17:00,718
be

3496
02:17:00,718 --> 02:17:02,879
careful with this area

3497
02:17:02,879 --> 02:17:04,318
here

3498
02:17:04,318 --> 02:17:07,120
um the one up here

3499
02:17:07,120 --> 02:17:08,718
um

3500
02:17:08,718 --> 02:17:11,840
because price traded below this low and

3501
02:17:11,840 --> 02:17:14,240
then came back into the area before

3502
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:15,920
leaving

3503
02:17:15,920 --> 02:17:17,120
and i guess that's what left the

3504
02:17:17,120 --> 02:17:19,120
imbalance it tapped off the imbalance

3505
02:17:19,120 --> 02:17:20,638
and pushed away come on look at this

3506

in what you've learned

3536
02:18:26,879 --> 02:18:30,000
don't hesitate to share this

3537
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,120
like there's so much good information

3538
02:18:33,120 --> 02:18:35,840
that other people can get even if all of

3539
02:18:35,840 --> 02:18:38,558
us became profitable in this market

3540
02:18:38,558 --> 02:18:40,398
it's still not enough to move this

3541
02:18:40,398 --> 02:18:41,840
market

3542
02:18:41,840 --> 02:18:43,439
because these this is a market that

3543
02:18:43,439 --> 02:18:45,120
banks are trading and that hedge funds

3544
02:18:45,120 --> 02:18:46,478
are trading in

3545
02:18:46,478 --> 02:18:47,519
so

3546
02:18:47,519 --> 02:18:50,799
share this information with people

3547
02:18:50,799 --> 02:18:51,599
like

3548
02:18:51,599 --> 02:18:54,240
they they can learn from this too

3549
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:55,840
i remember when i first started trading

3550
02:18:55,840 --> 02:18:56,718
um

3551
02:18:56,718 --> 02:18:58,240
you know i used to ask certain people

3552
02:18:58,240 --> 02:18:59,679
you know like what trades were they

3553
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:01,439
taking if they could teach me whatever

3554
02:19:01,439 --> 02:19:02,240
it is

3555
02:19:02,240 --> 02:19:03,679
there was just like

3556
02:19:03,679 --> 02:19:07,359
never any enthusiasm to to like actually

3557
02:19:07,359 --> 02:19:10,160
teach me what i needed to know and

3558
02:19:10,160 --> 02:19:11,679
you know

3559
02:19:11,679 --> 02:19:13,840
i was a little discouraged i will say

3560
02:19:13,840 --> 02:19:15,920
that i was a little discouraged because

3561
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:18,799
i mean i was just trying to find my way

3562
02:19:18,799 --> 02:19:21,519
and it led me to like going to learn

3563
02:19:21,519 --> 02:19:23,359
other groups and going to learn from

3564
02:19:23,359 --> 02:19:25,120
other groups and learn you know from

3565
02:19:25,120 --> 02:19:27,920
their trading styles and stuff and

3566
02:19:27,920 --> 02:19:30,799
you know it was it was just

3567
02:19:30,799 --> 02:19:33,439
it wasn't working

3568
02:19:33,439 --> 02:19:34,718
so there was people that had the

3569
02:19:34,718 --> 02:19:36,080
knowledge and was making money wouldn't

3570
02:19:36,080 --> 02:19:37,760
give it to me

3571
02:19:37,760 --> 02:19:39,120
or wouldn't at least teach me i was

3572
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:42,398
willing to learn willing to pay for it

3573
02:19:42,398 --> 02:19:44,879
so they had information would not share

3574
02:19:44,879 --> 02:19:46,240
it with me

3575
02:19:46,240 --> 02:19:47,359
and then

3576
02:19:47,359 --> 02:19:50,000
you also had people who

3577
02:19:50,000 --> 02:19:51,200
you know like

3578
02:19:51,200 --> 02:19:53,840
they cut it out everybody making noise

3579
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,760
because you want my attention then then

3580
02:19:55,760 --> 02:19:57,520
you have people who did not know what

3581
02:19:57,520 --> 02:19:58,960
they were talking about and were

3582
02:19:58,960 --> 02:20:00,000
teaching

3583
02:20:00,000 --> 02:20:00,960
and they didn't know what they were

3584
02:20:00,960 --> 02:20:03,520
talking about

3585
02:20:03,520 --> 02:20:06,080
like didn't know what they were talking

3586
02:20:06,080 --> 02:20:09,359
about at all

3587
02:20:09,359 --> 02:20:10,880
and

3588
02:20:10,880 --> 02:20:15,200
and and i understand the the um

3589
02:20:15,200 --> 02:20:18,240
the i don't know how i should say it

3590
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:20,000
i understand the

3591
02:20:20,000 --> 02:20:22,240
the effort made

3592
02:20:22,240 --> 02:20:26,560
to to like help and teach and and and

3593
02:20:26,560 --> 02:20:27,600
you know like

3594
02:20:27,600 --> 02:20:30,640
teach people through things but if you

3595
02:20:30,640 --> 02:20:32,960
understand that that you're even afraid

3596
02:20:32,960 --> 02:20:35,120
when you're in a trade or you may not

3597
02:20:35,120 --> 02:20:37,040
know where price is going or it's

3598
02:20:37,040 --> 02:20:39,120
difficult for you to find a setup

3599
02:20:39,120 --> 02:20:41,200
whenever you come into

3600
02:20:41,200 --> 02:20:42,960
you know like in

3601
02:20:42,960 --> 02:20:45,359
an area like this or a chart or whatever

3602
02:20:45,359 --> 02:20:47,120
on any time frame if

3603
02:20:47,120 --> 02:20:49,120
if your comfortability is only trading

3604
02:20:49,120 --> 02:20:50,960
on one time frame

3605
02:20:50,960 --> 02:20:52,399
rather than

3606
02:20:52,399 --> 02:20:54,880
all of the time frames you know or or if

3607
02:20:54,880 --> 02:20:57,600
you don't have like your stuff down pat

3608
02:20:57,600 --> 02:21:00,319
to where you're you're

3609
02:21:00,319 --> 02:21:01,200
winning

3610
02:21:01,200 --> 02:21:02,800
i mean you're you're you're and you end

3611
02:21:02,800 --> 02:21:04,560
up losing more than you're winning if if

3612
02:21:04,560 --> 02:21:05,680
that's you

3613
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:09,200
then you should not be teaching

3614
02:21:09,200 --> 02:21:11,120
you should not be mentoring you should

3615
02:21:11,120 --> 02:21:12,479
like there's more

3616
02:21:12,479 --> 02:21:14,800
to learn because this is

3617
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:16,479
as we always mentioned

3618
02:21:16,479 --> 02:21:19,520
this is people's money on the line

3619
02:21:19,520 --> 02:21:21,200
people's money

3620
02:21:21,200 --> 02:21:23,760
is on the line

3621
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:25,439
not just

3622
02:21:25,439 --> 02:21:26,479
you know

3623
02:21:26,479 --> 02:21:29,600
not just your popularity or or

3624
02:21:29,600 --> 02:21:31,359
whatever you can make from it or

3625
02:21:31,359 --> 02:21:33,200
whatever it is we're talking about

3626
02:21:33,200 --> 02:21:36,479
people's money that's on the line

3627
02:21:36,479 --> 02:21:38,800
you know like you you can't play around

3628
02:21:38,800 --> 02:21:41,200
with that

3629
02:21:41,200 --> 02:21:43,840
you know so for me i got a lot of

3630
02:21:43,840 --> 02:21:45,760
misguided information when i first

3631
02:21:45,760 --> 02:21:47,520
learned look at this i told you guys

3632
02:21:47,520 --> 02:21:50,319
these wicks sometimes could be hidden

3633
02:21:50,319 --> 02:21:52,399
um s and d zones

3634
02:21:52,399 --> 02:21:53,840
so you see how this taps up into the

3635
02:21:53,840 --> 02:21:55,280
zone gets rid there's the same thing

3636
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:57,120
here same thing that we mentioned here

3637
02:21:57,120 --> 02:21:58,880
tapped up into the zone rejected tapped

3638
02:21:58,880 --> 02:22:01,439
up into the hidden smd zone reject it

3639
02:22:01,439 --> 02:22:03,040
you're like these are things that you

3640
02:22:03,040 --> 02:22:05,359
you guys want to pay attention to so if

3641
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:07,280
you look there was a trade from here

3642
02:22:07,280 --> 02:22:09,920
going down to the next s d zone above

3643
02:22:09,920 --> 02:22:12,080
and then i mean we were talking so i

3644
02:22:12,080 --> 02:22:14,399
didn't really uh note this area but then

3645
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:16,880
there was this other smd here tap out of

3646
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,640
it again another 48. so so you

3647
02:22:18,640 --> 02:22:20,960
understand how you know like when i tell

3648
02:22:20,960 --> 02:22:23,200
people you know when i share with them

3649
02:22:23,200 --> 02:22:25,680
what i kind of make per day and stuff um

3650
02:22:25,680 --> 02:22:27,680
and what i choose to sometimes make per

3651
02:22:27,680 --> 02:22:29,520
day i show

3652
02:22:29,520 --> 02:22:31,439
like how easy it is

3653
02:22:31,439 --> 02:22:34,080
when it comes to these are all scalps i

3654
02:22:34,080 --> 02:22:36,000
don't even remember how many scallops we

3655
02:22:36,000 --> 02:22:38,080
even mentioned was was within these

3656
02:22:38,080 --> 02:22:40,800
areas from the imbalances to the top of

3657
02:22:40,800 --> 02:22:42,880
the zones the top of the

3658
02:22:42,880 --> 02:22:45,840
the uh order blocks or you know the top

3659
02:22:45,840 --> 02:22:47,120
of the

3660
02:22:47,120 --> 02:22:48,560
the uh

3661
02:22:48,560 --> 02:22:52,080
supply and demand areas the like

3662
02:22:52,080 --> 02:22:55,359
there's so many areas that price we see

3663
02:22:55,359 --> 02:22:57,120
price react from

3664
02:22:57,120 --> 02:22:59,520
and all we need is just the reaction

3665
02:22:59,520 --> 02:23:01,359
we don't need anything else we just need

3666
02:23:01,359 --> 02:23:03,840
to reaction

3667
02:23:03,840 --> 02:23:05,680
there's there's a lot of pips that you

3668
02:23:05,680 --> 02:23:08,800
can garner trading on this and when i

3669
02:23:08,800 --> 02:23:11,040
first started learning this people told

3670
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:12,560
me that this was the hardest thing to

3671
02:23:12,560 --> 02:23:13,840
trade

3672
02:23:13,840 --> 02:23:15,840
because this is equivalent to like spy

3673
02:23:15,840 --> 02:23:18,240
if you trade options on the stock market

3674
02:23:18,240 --> 02:23:20,160
it's equivalent to spy do you think the

3675
02:23:20,160 --> 02:23:23,280
price respects and balances during

3676
02:23:23,280 --> 02:23:26,399
um new york stock exchange open um yes

3677
02:23:26,399 --> 02:23:30,240
you you do have it um to where price um

3678
02:23:30,240 --> 02:23:32,560
uh it certainly um

3679
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:34,160
respects that because look at this right

3680
02:23:34,160 --> 02:23:35,680
here

3681
02:23:35,680 --> 02:23:37,280
let me move this here

3682
02:23:37,280 --> 02:23:39,520
i hate moving these lines because

3683
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:41,120
you know they take away the history of

3684
02:23:41,120 --> 02:23:42,960
what i've what i've done what i've

3685
02:23:42,960 --> 02:23:45,120
called what i've said but look this is

3686
02:23:45,120 --> 02:23:47,840
the imbalance here

3687
02:23:50,560 --> 02:23:52,640
this is oh no this is not the open

3688
02:23:52,640 --> 02:23:56,560
this is the imbalance from the open here

3689
02:23:57,359 --> 02:23:59,760
so you see this price quickly moving

3690
02:23:59,760 --> 02:24:01,520
within this area

3691
02:24:01,520 --> 02:24:03,359
what do we get

3692
02:24:03,359 --> 02:24:05,280
tap of this imbalance

3693
02:24:05,280 --> 02:24:07,760
straight away

3694
02:24:08,800 --> 02:24:11,439
so yeah it does respect um

3695
02:24:11,439 --> 02:24:12,880
uh the

3696
02:24:12,880 --> 02:24:15,600
the uh the the price of like the opening

3697
02:24:15,600 --> 02:24:17,520
price because this is this is the

3698
02:24:17,520 --> 02:24:19,120
opening and then you have this huge push

3699
02:24:19,120 --> 02:24:20,880
out of the area

3700
02:24:20,880 --> 02:24:22,640
you know and then also

3701
02:24:22,640 --> 02:24:24,880
you have let me see if it actually tap

3702
02:24:24,880 --> 02:24:28,680
this imbalance here

3703
02:24:30,160 --> 02:24:32,319
so you have a tap right here at this

3704
02:24:32,319 --> 02:24:35,200
imbalance also

3705
02:24:38,479 --> 02:24:40,399
26 pips just over the top of that

3706
02:24:40,399 --> 02:24:42,479
imbalance

3707
02:24:42,479 --> 02:24:44,479
and of course you'd wait for price to

3708
02:24:44,479 --> 02:24:46,319
get to the imbalance a second time to

3709
02:24:46,319 --> 02:24:47,840
see what it's going to do

3710
02:24:47,840 --> 02:24:48,800
and

3711
02:24:48,800 --> 02:24:51,280
if you don't see anything you know

3712
02:24:51,280 --> 02:24:53,040
happening it continues to push you just

3713
02:24:53,040 --> 02:24:54,880
look for the next area to potentially

3714
02:24:54,880 --> 02:24:58,240
trade from so we had this area here

3715
02:24:58,240 --> 02:25:00,720
well not we i originally had this one

3716
02:25:00,720 --> 02:25:02,640
when the market had um

3717
02:25:02,640 --> 02:25:05,120
open but i wasn't streaming as of yet um

3718
02:25:05,120 --> 02:25:06,720
so i had this area here that pricing get

3719
02:25:06,720 --> 02:25:08,399
rejected from and then i have this

3720
02:25:08,399 --> 02:25:10,240
fractal here that price could find

3721
02:25:10,240 --> 02:25:13,359
support and potentially head back up on

3722
02:25:13,359 --> 02:25:15,280
and then there was this other imbalance

3723
02:25:15,280 --> 02:25:16,800
that was here that price could reject

3724
02:25:16,800 --> 02:25:19,040
from price rejected from it then price

3725
02:25:19,040 --> 02:25:21,280
came up to touch into

3726
02:25:21,280 --> 02:25:23,200
this s and d here this on a higher time

3727
02:25:23,200 --> 02:25:24,880
frame what is that like a five minute

3728
02:25:24,880 --> 02:25:27,359
snd

3729
02:25:29,200 --> 02:25:30,800
no that's actually a higher timeframe

3730
02:25:30,800 --> 02:25:32,960
and balance

3731
02:25:32,960 --> 02:25:36,280
look at this

3732
02:25:38,080 --> 02:25:39,760
let's just tap the higher time frame in

3733
02:25:39,760 --> 02:25:41,040
balance

3734
02:25:41,040 --> 02:25:42,880
and then left but this is exactly what

3735
02:25:42,880 --> 02:25:44,880
i'm saying these things you can find on

3736
02:25:44,880 --> 02:25:47,359
every single time frame

3737
02:25:47,359 --> 02:25:48,640
every

3738
02:25:48,640 --> 02:25:51,040
single time frame

3739
02:25:51,040 --> 02:25:52,720
we just got an imbalance from a five

3740
02:25:52,720 --> 02:25:54,720
minute time frame and saw that this is

3741
02:25:54,720 --> 02:25:57,280
the area that it tapped to go short

3742
02:25:57,280 --> 02:25:58,720
and took out the low

3743
02:25:58,720 --> 02:26:01,120
the imbalance from the five minute so

3744
02:26:01,120 --> 02:26:02,479
the imbalance from the higher time

3745
02:26:02,479 --> 02:26:04,240
frames are stronger than the imbalance

3746
02:26:04,240 --> 02:26:06,880
from the lower time frames but you can

3747
02:26:06,880 --> 02:26:09,120
trade imbalances on all time frames if

3748
02:26:09,120 --> 02:26:11,760
you have a particular system or

3749
02:26:11,760 --> 02:26:13,520
or technique with it

3750
02:26:13,520 --> 02:26:14,319
and

3751
02:26:14,319 --> 02:26:16,640
for me it's it's best to

3752
02:26:16,640 --> 02:26:18,640
you know look at scalping of these

3753
02:26:18,640 --> 02:26:22,479
imbalances and if it returns for for

3754
02:26:22,479 --> 02:26:24,399
something else so you see it taps into

3755
02:26:24,399 --> 02:26:26,560
this imbalance here and then you get an

3756
02:26:26,560 --> 02:26:27,760
equal high

3757
02:26:27,760 --> 02:26:28,880
here

3758
02:26:28,880 --> 02:26:30,640
so you know the equal high is resulting

3759
02:26:30,640 --> 02:26:32,560
in either the run of this low or this

3760
02:26:32,560 --> 02:26:34,880
low one of the lows that created one of

3761
02:26:34,880 --> 02:26:37,840
the highs will be ran oftentimes it's

3762
02:26:37,840 --> 02:26:40,319
the first low that's ran

3763
02:26:40,319 --> 02:26:42,640
from the second equal well the the

3764
02:26:42,640 --> 02:26:44,560
second high that was made and then

3765
02:26:44,560 --> 02:26:46,000
sometimes you have

3766
02:26:46,000 --> 02:26:48,640
the the other low ran from the other

3767
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:50,479
high that was made

3768
02:26:50,479 --> 02:26:53,040
uh let me see um is it safe to say you

3769
02:26:53,040 --> 02:26:54,880
can scalp from the equal highs and equal

3770
02:26:54,880 --> 02:26:58,399
lows so oftentimes i do if i see a wick

3771
02:26:58,399 --> 02:27:00,560
rejection out of the area like a quick

3772
02:27:00,560 --> 02:27:02,479
move out of the area so look at this

3773
02:27:02,479 --> 02:27:04,080
here um

3774
02:27:04,080 --> 02:27:05,600
this is the equal high that i had just

3775
02:27:05,600 --> 02:27:06,479
mentioned

3776
02:27:06,479 --> 02:27:08,800
this here this here let's say you get

3777
02:27:08,800 --> 02:27:11,600
this push out of the area remember what

3778
02:27:11,600 --> 02:27:14,880
i talked about with this um

3779
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:16,479
this little candlestick pattern that i

3780
02:27:16,479 --> 02:27:17,920
mentioned

3781
02:27:17,920 --> 02:27:20,399
down here within this area

3782
02:27:20,399 --> 02:27:22,319
sorry that was like poor drawing i'm not

3783
02:27:22,319 --> 02:27:24,000
an artist by the way

3784
02:27:24,000 --> 02:27:26,399
this area here

3785
02:27:26,399 --> 02:27:28,880
you see price go down you see price push

3786
02:27:28,880 --> 02:27:31,439
up heavy quickly push down looks like

3787
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:33,840
we're gearing up for what an equal high

3788
02:27:33,840 --> 02:27:36,080
so what do i say oftentimes you see

3789
02:27:36,080 --> 02:27:38,080
where within this area there's something

3790
02:27:38,080 --> 02:27:40,399
in here like you know akima mentioned

3791
02:27:40,399 --> 02:27:42,240
the order block there's something in

3792
02:27:42,240 --> 02:27:43,040
here

3793
02:27:43,040 --> 02:27:46,479
that it often taps into and trades away

3794
02:27:46,479 --> 02:27:47,920
so here's how i was able to trade the

3795
02:27:47,920 --> 02:27:49,680
equal high saw the equal high

3796
02:27:49,680 --> 02:27:52,160
established saw an opportunity to get in

3797
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:54,640
went short what did i short to possibly

3798
02:27:54,640 --> 02:27:58,240
the first low or the second low i'm out

3799
02:27:58,240 --> 02:28:00,160
done for the day

3800
02:28:00,160 --> 02:28:01,920
that fast

3801
02:28:01,920 --> 02:28:04,960
i don't need to stay on the charts

3802
02:28:04,960 --> 02:28:06,399
so let's see i get grabbed into this

3803
02:28:06,399 --> 02:28:08,479
area and i'm taken down look look at a

3804
02:28:08,479 --> 02:28:12,319
whopping 80 something pimps

3805
02:28:12,319 --> 02:28:13,280
what

3806
02:28:13,280 --> 02:28:15,359
just off of noticing this one little

3807
02:28:15,359 --> 02:28:17,359
move fast within five minutes this all

3808
02:28:17,359 --> 02:28:19,680
happened within five minutes

3809
02:28:19,680 --> 02:28:21,280
if you noticed it in real time all

3810
02:28:21,280 --> 02:28:23,359
happened within five minutes bam bam you

3811
02:28:23,359 --> 02:28:24,800
out

3812
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:26,800
but you got to be exposed to the charts

3813
02:28:26,800 --> 02:28:29,760
enough to be able to see that and to

3814
02:28:29,760 --> 02:28:33,280
react with that in real time you got to

3815
02:28:33,280 --> 02:28:35,040
be able to to

3816
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:37,760
you know have enough exposure

3817
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:39,920
to to notice that to see that and be

3818
02:28:39,920 --> 02:28:42,880
like all right yeah cool this is where

3819
02:28:42,880 --> 02:28:45,359
this is where i'm trading from

3820
02:28:45,359 --> 02:28:47,680
this is what i'm doing

3821
02:28:47,680 --> 02:28:50,560
and you see all now this chart looks

3822
02:28:50,560 --> 02:28:51,520
like

3823
02:28:51,520 --> 02:28:53,600
it looks weird it looks like futuristic

3824
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:55,680
or almost like all these different lines

3825
02:28:55,680 --> 02:28:58,000
minimalistic you know in a sense

3826
02:28:58,000 --> 02:28:59,439
um

3827
02:28:59,439 --> 02:29:00,160
but

3828
02:29:00,160 --> 02:29:02,160
there's a method to it

3829
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:04,479
this is what the aftermath tends to look

3830
02:29:04,479 --> 02:29:05,920
like

3831
02:29:05,920 --> 02:29:08,720
but there's a method to all of this

3832
02:29:08,720 --> 02:29:10,880
so we know that

3833
02:29:10,880 --> 02:29:14,560
on a higher time frame if you look at

3834
02:29:14,560 --> 02:29:17,040
oh maybe like a 15 minute time frame

3835
02:29:17,040 --> 02:29:18,720
or a 30 minute time frame look at this

3836
02:29:18,720 --> 02:29:20,960
whole area

3837
02:29:20,960 --> 02:29:22,720
on a 15 minute time frame on a 30 minute

3838
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:24,399
time frame maybe i don't know let me see

3839
02:29:24,399 --> 02:29:26,080
let me double check

3840
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:28,479
sorry about that

3841
02:29:28,479 --> 02:29:31,120
so here's here's what streamers are

3842
02:29:31,120 --> 02:29:32,560
doing because they tend to trade from

3843
02:29:32,560 --> 02:29:34,479
the higher time frames

3844
02:29:34,479 --> 02:29:36,319
not only because they they probably

3845
02:29:36,319 --> 02:29:38,000
don't know what they're doing

3846
02:29:38,000 --> 02:29:39,520
but sometimes

3847
02:29:39,520 --> 02:29:41,280
i mean most times is that they they

3848
02:29:41,280 --> 02:29:43,200
really don't know what they're doing but

3849
02:29:43,200 --> 02:29:44,479
you know you

3850
02:29:44,479 --> 02:29:46,240
you have this area

3851
02:29:46,240 --> 02:29:48,800
and if you go to a higher time frame

3852
02:29:48,800 --> 02:29:51,120
people are like oh no this this is

3853
02:29:51,120 --> 02:29:53,040
ranging guys we can't do anything about

3854
02:29:53,040 --> 02:29:54,319
this you know

3855
02:29:54,319 --> 02:29:56,800
like maybe if it breaks above like this

3856
02:29:56,800 --> 02:29:59,200
area or if it comes below this area

3857
02:29:59,200 --> 02:30:00,000
we'll

3858
02:30:00,000 --> 02:30:01,920
we'll see but this is ranging no setup

3859
02:30:01,920 --> 02:30:03,680
guys and they just be waiting and

3860
02:30:03,680 --> 02:30:06,479
chatting for like four hours you're like

3861
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:09,040
what what are you doing guys four hours

3862
02:30:09,040 --> 02:30:10,960
you're sitting there you know just just

3863
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:12,240
talking

3864
02:30:12,240 --> 02:30:14,000
and saying that you can't trade any of

3865
02:30:14,000 --> 02:30:15,439
this

3866
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,280
even if you felt like you couldn't trade

3867
02:30:17,280 --> 02:30:19,280
any of this go down to the lower time

3868
02:30:19,280 --> 02:30:21,280
frames and use it as an opportunity to

3869
02:30:21,280 --> 02:30:23,200
teach people

3870
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:24,720
an opportunity to teach people about

3871
02:30:24,720 --> 02:30:26,399
price in real

3872
02:30:26,399 --> 02:30:27,840
time

3873
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,760
utilize that

3874
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:31,280
we can't find a setup from the time

3875
02:30:31,280 --> 02:30:34,160
frame we usually trade from but we see

3876
02:30:34,160 --> 02:30:35,760
that there's some consolidation

3877
02:30:35,760 --> 02:30:37,520
happening or some ranging happening

3878
02:30:37,520 --> 02:30:39,120
within here

3879
02:30:39,120 --> 02:30:42,640
use this as an opportunity to teach

3880
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:44,640
people who are following you

3881
02:30:44,640 --> 02:30:47,359
what you know

3882
02:30:47,359 --> 02:30:48,960
not just wait around and have some

3883
02:30:48,960 --> 02:30:51,120
dialogue with them oh let's let's check

3884
02:30:51,120 --> 02:30:55,280
d x y oh the d x y failed about a

3885
02:30:55,280 --> 02:30:57,680
dollar so you know like

3886
02:30:57,680 --> 02:30:59,760
or 10 cents or whatever that that figure

3887
02:30:59,760 --> 02:31:03,680
is i don't know you know with it

3888
02:31:03,680 --> 02:31:06,000
stop copying me boy

3889
02:31:06,000 --> 02:31:08,080
yeah so

3890
02:31:08,080 --> 02:31:10,720
so i even chart this so i i get an idea

3891
02:31:10,720 --> 02:31:12,640
of like

3892
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:13,680
you know

3893
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:16,720
when our recession potentially is coming

3894
02:31:16,720 --> 02:31:19,120
um so i do have a tap up into this area

3895
02:31:19,120 --> 02:31:20,479
potentially and this could be the

3896
02:31:20,479 --> 02:31:21,680
rejection

3897
02:31:21,680 --> 02:31:24,319
um for when we begin to enter um our

3898
02:31:24,319 --> 02:31:25,920
recession

3899
02:31:25,920 --> 02:31:27,600
but i do have these levels down here

3900
02:31:27,600 --> 02:31:29,600
this is actually the weekly i'm talking

3901
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:32,000
about the recession in america coming

3902
02:31:32,000 --> 02:31:33,040
um

3903
02:31:33,040 --> 02:31:35,200
so it's like right here look at how we

3904
02:31:35,200 --> 02:31:37,280
have we've had these huge pushers up

3905
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:39,840
from like 2014 economy started growing

3906
02:31:39,840 --> 02:31:42,960
after our recession down in here 2014 we

3907
02:31:42,960 --> 02:31:45,359
pushed up into this area but

3908
02:31:45,359 --> 02:31:47,200
we pushed up abnormally i don't know if

3909
02:31:47,200 --> 02:31:49,600
this is due to like war or whatever it

3910
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:53,439
is war usually fields the dollar um

3911
02:31:53,439 --> 02:31:56,319
going higher because most people who are

3912
02:31:56,319 --> 02:31:58,560
sending aid to other countries they're

3913
02:31:58,560 --> 02:32:00,479
sending it in

3914
02:32:00,479 --> 02:32:02,000
the dollar

3915
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:04,080
they're they're not really sending it in

3916
02:32:04,080 --> 02:32:07,120
euros or pounds or anything usually most

3917
02:32:07,120 --> 02:32:09,359
debts that are paid abroad are

3918
02:32:09,359 --> 02:32:11,120
in the u.s dollar

3919
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:12,720
um so

3920
02:32:12,720 --> 02:32:14,319
you know with this when they're sending

3921
02:32:14,319 --> 02:32:16,399
aid when they're you know they have a

3922
02:32:16,399 --> 02:32:18,000
bunch of money for war but they can't

3923
02:32:18,000 --> 02:32:19,520
feed the poor

3924
02:32:19,520 --> 02:32:22,319
i'm not a rapido but yeah they have that

3925
02:32:22,319 --> 02:32:23,680
and

3926
02:32:23,680 --> 02:32:25,600
that's when you see you start to see the

3927
02:32:25,600 --> 02:32:28,560
strength of the dollar start pushing

3928
02:32:28,560 --> 02:32:31,040
and then when we're not in any conflict

3929
02:32:31,040 --> 02:32:33,680
or any wars or anything like that

3930
02:32:33,680 --> 02:32:34,800
you know

3931
02:32:34,800 --> 02:32:36,160
we end up

3932
02:32:36,160 --> 02:32:37,760
losing

3933
02:32:37,760 --> 02:32:40,160
some sort of value

3934
02:32:40,160 --> 02:32:42,560
you know we um

3935
02:32:42,560 --> 02:32:45,120
pulled troops out of afghanistan

3936
02:32:45,120 --> 02:32:46,479
um

3937
02:32:46,479 --> 02:32:49,520
not too long ago and we began to shift

3938
02:32:49,520 --> 02:32:53,120
bearish but the war in ukraine

3939
02:32:53,120 --> 02:32:54,399
kind of

3940
02:32:54,399 --> 02:32:55,920
pushed this up because a lot of people

3941
02:32:55,920 --> 02:32:58,080
are sending aid packages to ukraine and

3942
02:32:58,080 --> 02:33:02,240
stuff exactly exactly park there we go

3943
02:33:02,240 --> 02:33:07,160
yo i definitely gotta beat you bro we

3944
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:10,160
yeah so so i usually use this to time

3945
02:33:10,160 --> 02:33:11,040
like

3946
02:33:11,040 --> 02:33:12,160
you know what's going on with the

3947
02:33:12,160 --> 02:33:14,000
american dollar and our economy and

3948
02:33:14,000 --> 02:33:16,800
things like that use the russell the was

3949
02:33:16,800 --> 02:33:18,880
it the russell 2000 to time how the

3950
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:20,720
markets are doing

3951
02:33:20,720 --> 02:33:21,680
um

3952
02:33:21,680 --> 02:33:24,479
the yield curve and and your treasury

3953
02:33:24,479 --> 02:33:25,920
yields to time

3954
02:33:25,920 --> 02:33:27,920
like other things within other markets

3955
02:33:27,920 --> 02:33:29,680
the bond markets all of those different

3956
02:33:29,680 --> 02:33:31,680
things you could utilize

3957
02:33:31,680 --> 02:33:34,880
this same analysis that we use to trade

3958
02:33:34,880 --> 02:33:36,880
we could utilize this same analysis to

3959
02:33:36,880 --> 02:33:38,240
be able to understand what's happening

3960
02:33:38,240 --> 02:33:40,240
within our economy what's happening with

3961
02:33:40,240 --> 02:33:42,399
the american dollar what's like it's

3962
02:33:42,399 --> 02:33:44,640
it's interest so it's it's analysis it's

3963
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:47,439
financial analysis um and you could use

3964
02:33:47,439 --> 02:33:49,439
this in so many different areas to

3965
02:33:49,439 --> 02:33:52,960
benefit you so if the dxy is currently

3966
02:33:52,960 --> 02:33:54,319
shorting

3967
02:33:54,319 --> 02:33:56,640
then that means that anything

3968
02:33:56,640 --> 02:33:58,399
against the dollar

3969
02:33:58,399 --> 02:34:02,000
is probably longing

3970
02:34:02,000 --> 02:34:04,240
at this

3971
02:34:04,240 --> 02:34:05,920
it's pushing up

3972
02:34:05,920 --> 02:34:08,560
so this and this is the same candle june

3973
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:12,240
13 candle on the dxy

3974
02:34:12,960 --> 02:34:14,640
shorting

3975
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:17,120
this is for the week

3976
02:34:17,120 --> 02:34:19,680
and anything against the dollar

3977
02:34:19,680 --> 02:34:22,160
longing

3978
02:34:22,479 --> 02:34:26,080
gbp usd against the dollar longing

3979
02:34:26,080 --> 02:34:28,560
so you could utilize this particular

3980
02:34:28,560 --> 02:34:29,600
thing

3981
02:34:29,600 --> 02:34:31,840
if you're using eu gu

3982
02:34:31,840 --> 02:34:35,359
you know or or any type of whatever you

3983
02:34:35,359 --> 02:34:37,840
you know you could utilize this

3984
02:34:37,840 --> 02:34:40,000
to be able to have like some added

3985
02:34:40,000 --> 02:34:42,160
confluence or some added you know

3986
02:34:42,160 --> 02:34:45,040
strength to to like the trades that

3987
02:34:45,040 --> 02:34:47,120
you're taking now sometimes they will

3988
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:48,960
both go down together

3989
02:34:48,960 --> 02:34:49,680
um

3990
02:34:49,680 --> 02:34:51,840
you have that you know then there's like

3991
02:34:51,840 --> 02:34:55,120
a little correction to it but oftentimes

3992
02:34:55,120 --> 02:34:56,800
this is it

3993
02:34:56,800 --> 02:34:59,520
so so yeah this is this is

3994
02:34:59,520 --> 02:35:04,080
you know the the us dollar against gold

3995
02:35:06,160 --> 02:35:08,560
you had gold b you had gold bearish look

3996
02:35:08,560 --> 02:35:10,000
at this

3997
02:35:10,000 --> 02:35:12,960
gold was bearish from here

3998
02:35:12,960 --> 02:35:15,680
the u.s dollar began to fall

3999
02:35:15,680 --> 02:35:16,800
and gold

4000
02:35:16,800 --> 02:35:18,479
is pushing up

4001
02:35:18,479 --> 02:35:19,760
with it

4002
02:35:19,760 --> 02:35:22,479
because the u.s dollar is falling

4003
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:26,640
so gold against the us dollar

4004
02:35:26,640 --> 02:35:28,720
you have some

4005
02:35:28,720 --> 02:35:31,200
some bullish momentum

4006
02:35:31,200 --> 02:35:33,200
going on and that's within the last two

4007
02:35:33,200 --> 02:35:35,359
days that gold has been like pushing out

4008
02:35:35,359 --> 02:35:36,880
of the area

4009
02:35:36,880 --> 02:35:38,479
but this is why i say you know like i

4010
02:35:38,479 --> 02:35:40,080
keep talking about this this discord we

4011
02:35:40,080 --> 02:35:41,760
can get it up and running soon um this

4012
02:35:41,760 --> 02:35:44,160
is almost done by the way guys um but

4013
02:35:44,160 --> 02:35:48,000
this is exactly why i have my bias was

4014
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:50,000
that we're pushing down into this area

4015
02:35:50,000 --> 02:35:53,120
and longing most people were short on

4016
02:35:53,120 --> 02:35:54,560
gold

4017
02:35:54,560 --> 02:35:57,200
and did not know where we were short too

4018
02:35:57,200 --> 02:35:58,640
look at these areas that i have back

4019
02:35:58,640 --> 02:36:00,240
here

4020
02:36:00,240 --> 02:36:02,960
gold tapped my line here

4021
02:36:02,960 --> 02:36:04,960
and it started to push up

4022
02:36:04,960 --> 02:36:08,160
this is the reversal where gold started

4023
02:36:08,160 --> 02:36:10,240
i told you the stuff i teach you can

4024
02:36:10,240 --> 02:36:12,560
catch these reversals

4025
02:36:12,560 --> 02:36:15,120
so this is over over the span of two

4026
02:36:15,120 --> 02:36:16,080
days

4027
02:36:16,080 --> 02:36:19,680
gold has pushed 44 dollars

4028
02:36:19,680 --> 02:36:22,399
over the span of two days

4029
02:36:22,399 --> 02:36:25,359
so i i can analyze for long term i could

4030
02:36:25,359 --> 02:36:27,760
analyze for sure too i could analyze for

4031
02:36:27,760 --> 02:36:30,240
a couple minutes i could analyze for for

4032
02:36:30,240 --> 02:36:32,319
a couple months

4033
02:36:32,319 --> 02:36:34,160
and that's just

4034
02:36:34,160 --> 02:36:37,040
the power of technical analysis

4035
02:36:37,040 --> 02:36:38,640
this is what i'm talking about you do

4036
02:36:38,640 --> 02:36:42,000
not need to follow news you do not need

4037
02:36:42,000 --> 02:36:43,680
to like

4038
02:36:43,680 --> 02:36:46,000
fundamentals are great

4039
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:49,439
if you were using fundamentals for like

4040
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:51,600
the longevity of a

4041
02:36:51,600 --> 02:36:53,840
a particular company

4042
02:36:53,840 --> 02:36:57,200
like let's say amc or or um

4043
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:59,520
gamestop or whatever it is you know like

4044
02:36:59,520 --> 02:37:03,200
or or tesla or rivien or amazon or

4045
02:37:03,200 --> 02:37:05,760
google look at the longevity of those

4046
02:37:05,760 --> 02:37:07,040
companies

4047
02:37:07,040 --> 02:37:08,560
and when you're paying attention to the

4048
02:37:08,560 --> 02:37:11,120
longevity of those companies you would

4049
02:37:11,120 --> 02:37:13,520
use fundamentals yes

4050
02:37:13,520 --> 02:37:16,640
to to invest long term but you also pair

4051
02:37:16,640 --> 02:37:18,880
it with technical analysis

4052
02:37:18,880 --> 02:37:21,280
for me for the day i'm day trading i'm

4053
02:37:21,280 --> 02:37:24,000
not using any fundamentals at all i do

4054
02:37:24,000 --> 02:37:26,479
not need fundamentals for day trading

4055
02:37:26,479 --> 02:37:28,160
at all like it's

4056
02:37:28,160 --> 02:37:30,880
it's not something that i recommend

4057
02:37:30,880 --> 02:37:32,720
anybody use

4058
02:37:32,720 --> 02:37:34,640
you know yeah fundamentals are great to

4059
02:37:34,640 --> 02:37:36,640
spot manipulations but oftentimes

4060
02:37:36,640 --> 02:37:39,200
manipulations still happen within

4061
02:37:39,200 --> 02:37:41,600
structure

4062
02:37:41,600 --> 02:37:44,000
still happens within structure

4063
02:37:44,000 --> 02:37:45,920
they manipulate but they're not running

4064
02:37:45,920 --> 02:37:47,760
their stop losses

4065
02:37:47,760 --> 02:37:50,399
so if they're trading according to

4066
02:37:50,399 --> 02:37:53,600
you know whatever whatever algorithm

4067
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:55,200
they're they're using if they're trading

4068
02:37:55,200 --> 02:37:57,359
according to that

4069
02:37:57,359 --> 02:37:58,240
then

4070
02:37:58,240 --> 02:37:59,680
you have to remember that their stop

4071
02:37:59,680 --> 02:38:02,800
losses are somewhere

4072
02:38:02,880 --> 02:38:05,200
and and with their stop losses

4073
02:38:05,200 --> 02:38:07,280
wherever it is that they are they're not

4074
02:38:07,280 --> 02:38:08,880
they're not going to run their own stop

4075
02:38:08,880 --> 02:38:12,479
losses exactly it's just faster news

4076
02:38:12,479 --> 02:38:14,479
news causes price like fundamentals

4077
02:38:14,479 --> 02:38:17,680
causes price to be manipulated

4078
02:38:17,680 --> 02:38:18,880
faster

4079
02:38:18,880 --> 02:38:21,840
it causes price to move to its areas

4080
02:38:21,840 --> 02:38:23,040
faster

4081
02:38:23,040 --> 02:38:24,720
so when it gets to those areas when

4082
02:38:24,720 --> 02:38:27,120
price gets there faster then you see a

4083
02:38:27,120 --> 02:38:30,240
reaction from there to there to there to

4084
02:38:30,240 --> 02:38:32,720
there so when when news was happening

4085
02:38:32,720 --> 02:38:34,560
when i had mentioned um you know like

4086
02:38:34,560 --> 02:38:36,160
yesterday i mentioned some of those

4087
02:38:36,160 --> 02:38:38,560
levels you saw that news just sped it up

4088
02:38:38,560 --> 02:38:40,240
to get there

4089
02:38:40,240 --> 02:38:42,240
and it did not go beyond those levels

4090
02:38:42,240 --> 02:38:44,319
that i had

4091
02:38:44,319 --> 02:38:45,200
so

4092
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:49,359
technical analysis is truly king

4093
02:38:49,359 --> 02:38:50,800
truly

4094
02:38:50,800 --> 02:38:52,640
look at this rejection here

4095
02:38:52,640 --> 02:38:54,560
from from this other area that i have up

4096
02:38:54,560 --> 02:38:57,120
here

4097
02:38:57,120 --> 02:38:59,040
even if this doesn't result in a in a

4098
02:38:59,040 --> 02:39:00,399
huge rejection

4099
02:39:00,399 --> 02:39:02,479
rejection nonetheless

4100
02:39:02,479 --> 02:39:04,479
look at this

4101
02:39:04,479 --> 02:39:07,280
34 pips down already in two candles and

4102
02:39:07,280 --> 02:39:10,479
still falling

4103
02:39:10,479 --> 02:39:13,920
look at what i said this area here

4104
02:39:13,920 --> 02:39:16,319
right here

4105
02:39:16,319 --> 02:39:19,200
you have this this buying up into the

4106
02:39:19,200 --> 02:39:21,600
cellar into this buy-in here

4107
02:39:21,600 --> 02:39:23,359
you know this is what i talk about in

4108
02:39:23,359 --> 02:39:24,640
terms of like

4109
02:39:24,640 --> 02:39:27,280
some of these appearing as

4110
02:39:27,280 --> 02:39:30,960
s and d's and oftentimes they're not

4111
02:39:30,960 --> 02:39:33,040
you know this one there's a potential

4112
02:39:33,040 --> 02:39:34,960
that this could be because

4113
02:39:34,960 --> 02:39:37,439
if you look at structure this was the s

4114
02:39:37,439 --> 02:39:40,479
and d responsible for breaking the high

4115
02:39:40,479 --> 02:39:43,120
of structure right here so that's why

4116
02:39:43,120 --> 02:39:45,200
you could have this reaction pushing in

4117
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:47,600
here i told you anytime you want to

4118
02:39:47,600 --> 02:39:50,640
look for s and d's look for s and d's

4119
02:39:50,640 --> 02:39:53,200
that broke behind that that broke

4120
02:39:53,200 --> 02:39:54,319
structure

4121
02:39:54,319 --> 02:39:56,640
those are s and d's that have stronger

4122
02:39:56,640 --> 02:39:59,120
movements to it those s and d's that

4123
02:39:59,120 --> 02:40:00,640
broke structure

4124
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:01,920
so

4125
02:40:01,920 --> 02:40:04,960
this one has a huge push off of it after

4126
02:40:04,960 --> 02:40:09,680
mitigating what is this like 90 of it

4127
02:40:12,880 --> 02:40:15,760
yeah after mitigating like almost 90 95

4128
02:40:15,760 --> 02:40:19,600
96 of it you have this huge push up

4129
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:21,520
after

4130
02:40:21,520 --> 02:40:24,160
but then we still don't take out this

4131
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:27,279
high to the left

4132
02:40:27,439 --> 02:40:30,479
we still didn't run that high

4133
02:40:31,760 --> 02:40:32,800
so

4134
02:40:32,800 --> 02:40:34,880
is is this

4135
02:40:34,880 --> 02:40:37,600
if if it goes below this s d would you

4136
02:40:37,600 --> 02:40:39,520
say that this s d was

4137
02:40:39,520 --> 02:40:42,399
was useful

4138
02:40:44,160 --> 02:40:46,840
you know no it's

4139
02:40:46,840 --> 02:40:48,880
not because

4140
02:40:48,880 --> 02:40:52,000
there's no run of the high

4141
02:40:52,000 --> 02:40:54,880
we quickly pushed up took out a high

4142
02:40:54,880 --> 02:40:56,240
right here

4143
02:40:56,240 --> 02:40:59,600
and then traded back below it

4144
02:40:59,920 --> 02:41:01,359
and this can be trading just to come

4145
02:41:01,359 --> 02:41:03,840
back into to this s and d here and still

4146
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:06,800
push higher yes there's a possibility

4147
02:41:06,800 --> 02:41:09,600
within here let me show you guys

4148
02:41:09,600 --> 02:41:12,800
oh so this was here i gotta i gotta keep

4149
02:41:12,800 --> 02:41:15,359
i can remember to move my my lines that

4150
02:41:15,359 --> 02:41:16,640
i create

4151
02:41:16,640 --> 02:41:18,720
so they don't

4152
02:41:18,720 --> 02:41:21,520
trip anybody up

4153
02:41:21,520 --> 02:41:23,840
we had it there

4154
02:41:23,840 --> 02:41:25,439
um

4155
02:41:25,439 --> 02:41:30,359
this was valid for a short here

4156
02:41:30,560 --> 02:41:33,439
this was probably coming to touch this s

4157
02:41:33,439 --> 02:41:36,399
and d here

4158
02:41:38,080 --> 02:41:40,800
this s d mitigated this one

4159
02:41:40,800 --> 02:41:44,800
this currently is being mitigated

4160
02:41:44,800 --> 02:41:46,880
so if price let's say price does trade

4161
02:41:46,880 --> 02:41:48,800
above this area

4162
02:41:48,800 --> 02:41:51,439
and let's say it taps here

4163
02:41:51,439 --> 02:41:53,520
or even here

4164
02:41:53,520 --> 02:41:55,359
you know that if there's a tap here and

4165
02:41:55,359 --> 02:41:58,479
a rejection out of either here or here

4166
02:41:58,479 --> 02:42:01,600
let's say if it does go up here or here

4167
02:42:01,600 --> 02:42:03,439
you know that

4168
02:42:03,439 --> 02:42:05,520
this area here

4169
02:42:05,520 --> 02:42:07,760
would potentially be an area that price

4170
02:42:07,760 --> 02:42:10,880
just pushed past why because the area is

4171
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:13,680
mitigated already

4172
02:42:13,680 --> 02:42:15,760
so now all this would all this would

4173
02:42:15,760 --> 02:42:17,600
need to do is

4174
02:42:17,600 --> 02:42:20,000
push down here

4175
02:42:20,000 --> 02:42:22,319
run this area come back up into this

4176
02:42:22,319 --> 02:42:23,920
area

4177
02:42:23,920 --> 02:42:26,880
mitigate the area and then continue down

4178
02:42:26,880 --> 02:42:28,080
to where

4179
02:42:28,080 --> 02:42:30,560
other unmitigated areas what do we have

4180
02:42:30,560 --> 02:42:33,359
an imbalance here we also have

4181
02:42:33,359 --> 02:42:36,240
a demand area down here so this could be

4182
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:38,319
the next target for price

4183
02:42:38,319 --> 02:42:41,439
touching into this area possibly the

4184
02:42:41,439 --> 02:42:43,680
midway of the imbalance possibly have a

4185
02:42:43,680 --> 02:42:46,399
reaction somewhere at this fractal here

4186
02:42:46,399 --> 02:42:50,000
or overall this s and d that's here this

4187
02:42:50,000 --> 02:42:51,760
demand area that's down here

4188
02:42:51,760 --> 02:42:52,720
if

4189
02:42:52,720 --> 02:42:55,120
if it does get down here

4190
02:42:55,120 --> 02:42:57,040
you know so

4191
02:42:57,040 --> 02:42:59,040
these are things to just pay attention

4192
02:42:59,040 --> 02:43:00,080
to

4193
02:43:00,080 --> 02:43:02,720
when you're in certain trades

4194
02:43:02,720 --> 02:43:04,880
when you're taking certain trades

4195
02:43:04,880 --> 02:43:07,040
these are things to pay attention to so

4196
02:43:07,040 --> 02:43:09,279
this low here was responsible for

4197
02:43:09,279 --> 02:43:11,200
creating this high

4198
02:43:11,200 --> 02:43:13,760
and this low here

4199
02:43:13,760 --> 02:43:16,880
was responsible for creating this height

4200
02:43:16,880 --> 02:43:18,479
what do we end up getting

4201
02:43:18,479 --> 02:43:20,880
a run of the low but what did i say

4202
02:43:20,880 --> 02:43:23,200
i mentioned that often times

4203
02:43:23,200 --> 02:43:25,279
you have it to where you have this push

4204
02:43:25,279 --> 02:43:27,680
up followed by this push down and then

4205
02:43:27,680 --> 02:43:30,720
you have an area that price can tap into

4206
02:43:30,720 --> 02:43:33,200
and then go short from we just mentioned

4207
02:43:33,200 --> 02:43:35,200
the same thing over here

4208
02:43:35,200 --> 02:43:38,000
right here the same exact thing happened

4209
02:43:38,000 --> 02:43:39,760
so this happens on a higher time frame

4210
02:43:39,760 --> 02:43:42,240
could you imagine more the the more

4211
02:43:42,240 --> 02:43:44,240
value you get within that from the

4212
02:43:44,240 --> 02:43:46,479
higher time frame but this just happened

4213
02:43:46,479 --> 02:43:48,240
here

4214
02:43:48,240 --> 02:43:50,800
this happened here this happened here we

4215
02:43:50,800 --> 02:43:52,479
talked about another area somewhere

4216
02:43:52,479 --> 02:43:54,399
around here that it happened can't can

4217
02:43:54,399 --> 02:43:56,960
exactly remember but

4218
02:43:56,960 --> 02:44:00,800
same thing over and over again

4219
02:44:00,800 --> 02:44:03,120
over look this happened here you had

4220
02:44:03,120 --> 02:44:05,439
this followed by this what this wick

4221
02:44:05,439 --> 02:44:07,359
came down tapped into the area and took

4222
02:44:07,359 --> 02:44:09,760
you up

4223
02:44:09,920 --> 02:44:12,399
like this happens everywhere

4224
02:44:12,399 --> 02:44:14,880
you know and and i just want people to

4225
02:44:14,880 --> 02:44:18,240
to get it to to understand it to you

4226
02:44:18,240 --> 02:44:19,760
know like

4227
02:44:19,760 --> 02:44:21,920
these things are easy to see in real

4228
02:44:21,920 --> 02:44:22,800
time

4229
02:44:22,800 --> 02:44:26,160
these things are easy to to spot

4230
02:44:26,160 --> 02:44:27,439
and

4231
02:44:27,439 --> 02:44:30,720
and it's so helpful when it comes to

4232
02:44:30,720 --> 02:44:33,120
your trading is helpful when it comes to

4233
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:34,160
like

4234
02:44:34,160 --> 02:44:36,720
being able to spot and learn it in real

4235
02:44:36,720 --> 02:44:38,560
time being able to catch a quick scout

4236
02:44:38,560 --> 02:44:41,200
being able to stay into trades longer it

4237
02:44:41,200 --> 02:44:42,040
is

4238
02:44:42,040 --> 02:44:44,960
extremely helpful extremely helpful if

4239
02:44:44,960 --> 02:44:46,399
you're having a problem spotting

4240
02:44:46,399 --> 02:44:47,840
imbalances

4241
02:44:47,840 --> 02:44:50,240
maybe you should use the the imbalance

4242
02:44:50,240 --> 02:44:52,640
indicator that i had mentioned

4243
02:44:52,640 --> 02:44:56,080
it's an indicator that's in real time

4244
02:44:56,080 --> 02:44:59,800
oh i don't know what

4245
02:45:00,479 --> 02:45:03,040
it's an indicator that's in real time

4246
02:45:03,040 --> 02:45:03,920
and

4247
02:45:03,920 --> 02:45:06,399
with these indicators that that i'm not

4248
02:45:06,399 --> 02:45:09,120
saying that you should you know utilize

4249
02:45:09,120 --> 02:45:11,760
this and only trade from this but what

4250
02:45:11,760 --> 02:45:13,439
i'm saying is this would help you spot

4251
02:45:13,439 --> 02:45:15,520
the imbalances easier

4252
02:45:15,520 --> 02:45:18,160
this is what i used to be able to notice

4253
02:45:18,160 --> 02:45:20,720
the imbalances easier when i first

4254
02:45:20,720 --> 02:45:22,640
didn't understand the concept of

4255
02:45:22,640 --> 02:45:23,920
imbalance

4256
02:45:23,920 --> 02:45:26,479
and now since i understand the concept

4257
02:45:26,479 --> 02:45:28,319
of imbalance and i know how to take

4258
02:45:28,319 --> 02:45:31,200
trades from imbalances or take scalps

4259
02:45:31,200 --> 02:45:32,960
from imbalances

4260
02:45:32,960 --> 02:45:36,000
i then utilize this to

4261
02:45:36,000 --> 02:45:39,439
to be able to facilitate that for me

4262
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:41,520
you know and and this kind of helps and

4263
02:45:41,520 --> 02:45:44,080
now i don't need this anymore

4264
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:46,160
because now i could spot imbalances and

4265
02:45:46,160 --> 02:45:48,160
that's just the more that you expose

4266
02:45:48,160 --> 02:45:50,319
yourself to the charts you're able to

4267
02:45:50,319 --> 02:45:51,600
spot this

4268
02:45:51,600 --> 02:45:52,960
you know so

4269
02:45:52,960 --> 02:45:55,040
this this was very helpful early on in

4270
02:45:55,040 --> 02:45:57,040
my journey but you want to learn how to

4271
02:45:57,040 --> 02:45:59,279
kick the indicators all together

4272
02:45:59,279 --> 02:46:01,200
you don't want to have to use indicators

4273
02:46:01,200 --> 02:46:02,160
at all

4274
02:46:02,160 --> 02:46:04,560
i am not interested in using indicators

4275
02:46:04,560 --> 02:46:05,439
at all

4276
02:46:05,439 --> 02:46:07,680
i don't want to use indicators i want to

4277
02:46:07,680 --> 02:46:09,279
be able to see it in real time because

4278
02:46:09,279 --> 02:46:11,040
guess what let's say a billionaire buys

4279
02:46:11,040 --> 02:46:12,560
trading bill

4280
02:46:12,560 --> 02:46:13,680
and you're in a trade and you're

4281
02:46:13,680 --> 02:46:15,920
dependent on indicators

4282
02:46:15,920 --> 02:46:16,800
and

4283
02:46:16,800 --> 02:46:18,479
they just shut down indicators for the

4284
02:46:18,479 --> 02:46:19,439
day

4285
02:46:19,439 --> 02:46:21,520
you know how easy it is how easy it

4286
02:46:21,520 --> 02:46:23,279
would be to manipulate

4287
02:46:23,279 --> 02:46:25,279
you know retail traders

4288
02:46:25,279 --> 02:46:27,680
because how they understand that that

4289
02:46:27,680 --> 02:46:29,439
there's this dependence

4290
02:46:29,439 --> 02:46:31,359
on indicators for them

4291
02:46:31,359 --> 02:46:34,319
be extremely easy

4292
02:46:34,319 --> 02:46:37,120
like look i i mentioned you know

4293
02:46:37,120 --> 02:46:39,359
you know the the imbalance finder thing

4294
02:46:39,359 --> 02:46:41,439
that that i showed you guys look at this

4295
02:46:41,439 --> 02:46:43,760
tap into this imbalance trade away from

4296
02:46:43,760 --> 02:46:45,520
it

4297
02:46:45,520 --> 02:46:48,080
another quick scout

4298
02:46:48,080 --> 02:46:50,160
and now this is pushing up i i don't

4299
02:46:50,160 --> 02:46:52,720
know what the huge flip is but

4300
02:46:52,720 --> 02:46:55,040
it's it's still a quick scalp from the

4301
02:46:55,040 --> 02:46:57,439
area

4302
02:46:57,439 --> 02:47:00,000
look at this 30 pip scalp now we're

4303
02:47:00,000 --> 02:47:02,000
pushing don't know where we're going

4304
02:47:02,000 --> 02:47:03,359
don't know if it's just tapping into

4305
02:47:03,359 --> 02:47:05,520
this supply and leaving could be you

4306
02:47:05,520 --> 02:47:07,359
know but

4307
02:47:07,359 --> 02:47:10,000
this like catching these things quick so

4308
02:47:10,000 --> 02:47:11,680
this would have been two trades back to

4309
02:47:11,680 --> 02:47:12,640
back

4310
02:47:12,640 --> 02:47:14,960
if you look at it

4311
02:47:14,960 --> 02:47:17,120
trade down here coming from this area

4312
02:47:17,120 --> 02:47:18,720
that you noticed

4313
02:47:18,720 --> 02:47:20,560
trade from the imbalance coming down to

4314
02:47:20,560 --> 02:47:21,840
here

4315
02:47:21,840 --> 02:47:24,720
oh and and look

4316
02:47:26,000 --> 02:47:28,080
oh my gosh

4317
02:47:28,080 --> 02:47:31,760
oh my gosh and look at what we hit

4318
02:47:31,760 --> 02:47:35,319
we hit an impact

4319
02:47:39,359 --> 02:47:41,840
this this is

4320
02:47:41,840 --> 02:47:43,279
i'm telling you this is phenomenal

4321
02:47:43,279 --> 02:47:44,800
information guys

4322
02:47:44,800 --> 02:47:46,880
phenomenal information

4323
02:47:46,880 --> 02:47:49,760
look at what we hit we hit another

4324
02:47:49,760 --> 02:47:52,319
imbalance that was down here i said we

4325
02:47:52,319 --> 02:47:54,720
could potentially hit the imbalance or

4326
02:47:54,720 --> 02:47:56,960
we could hit the fractal or maybe the s

4327
02:47:56,960 --> 02:48:00,319
and d what did we tap with the long wick

4328
02:48:00,319 --> 02:48:02,960
away the long rejection away

4329
02:48:02,960 --> 02:48:06,160
we tap the imbalance

4330
02:48:07,040 --> 02:48:08,640
and where do we go

4331
02:48:08,640 --> 02:48:13,439
60 something pips up from the imbalance

4332
02:48:13,439 --> 02:48:15,600
this is what i want you guys to

4333
02:48:15,600 --> 02:48:18,600
understand

4334
02:48:18,720 --> 02:48:20,479
these are so

4335
02:48:20,479 --> 02:48:22,080
important

4336
02:48:22,080 --> 02:48:26,800
so so so so so

4337
02:48:27,000 --> 02:48:31,359
important oh my gosh

4338
02:48:31,359 --> 02:48:33,520
i don't say these things for

4339
02:48:33,520 --> 02:48:36,479
for giggles for fun or or anything like

4340
02:48:36,479 --> 02:48:38,160

important such

4343
02:48:42,399 --> 02:48:45,279
important areas

4344
02:48:45,279 --> 02:48:47,200
and and i'm i'm teaching this in real

4345
02:48:47,200 --> 02:48:49,040
time because i'm trying to help you guys

4346
02:48:49,040 --> 02:48:51,279
to understand like

like this happens over and over and over

4348
02:48:54,800 --> 02:48:55,680
again

4349
02:48:55,680 --> 02:48:56,800

understand how powerful this is to like

4354
02:49:06,960 --> 02:49:10,399
if i saw this and somebody was like

4355
02:49:10,399 --> 02:49:13,040
hey man you know

4356
02:49:13,040 --> 02:49:14,240

saying forever

4365
02:49:29,600 --> 02:49:30,360
all

4366
02:49:30,360 --> 02:49:31,520

time

4370
02:49:37,840 --> 02:49:39,680
to taking this all in

4371
02:49:39,680 --> 02:49:42,640
you know i had um uh one person um

4372
02:49:42,640 --> 02:49:44,640
tell me i actually want her to be a

4373
02:49:44,640 --> 02:49:47,600
moderator in the group too um

4374
02:49:47,600 --> 02:49:49,439
she told me that

4375
02:49:49,439 --> 02:49:51,760
she's addicted to watching it like she

4376
02:49:51,760 --> 02:49:53,920
she watches it while she's eating while

4377
02:49:53,920 --> 02:49:55,359
she's going to sleep while she's

4378
02:49:55,359 --> 02:49:57,040
traveling she's just watching it because

4379
02:49:57,040 --> 02:49:58,800
she really wants it she really wants to

4380
02:49:58,800 --> 02:50:00,640
get it and i really want her to get it

4381
02:50:00,640 --> 02:50:02,960
too i want all of you guys to get it but

4382
02:50:02,960 --> 02:50:04,800
i want you guys to understand

4383
02:50:04,800 --> 02:50:06,479
the power of

4384
02:50:06,479 --> 02:50:10,399
utilizing this so even if you were in a

4385
02:50:10,399 --> 02:50:12,960
push-up from this imbalance

4386
02:50:12,960 --> 02:50:14,479
you also

4387
02:50:14,479 --> 02:50:17,200
see that what did price do tap into the

4388
02:50:17,200 --> 02:50:20,960
area above the line that we had above

4389
02:50:20,960 --> 02:50:22,720
right here after it tapped into there

4390
02:50:22,720 --> 02:50:25,840
what did we get a 24 pip rejection from

4391
02:50:25,840 --> 02:50:27,840
that did we get the candlestick

4392
02:50:27,840 --> 02:50:29,920
rejection that i said i like the little

4393
02:50:29,920 --> 02:50:31,760
candlestick pattern where it wicks up

4394
02:50:31,760 --> 02:50:32,720
above

4395
02:50:32,720 --> 02:50:34,880
and then shorts

4396
02:50:34,880 --> 02:50:37,840
it's right here

4397
02:50:37,840 --> 02:50:40,479
right here

4398
02:50:41,359 --> 02:50:43,600
got the rejection

4399
02:50:43,600 --> 02:50:45,359
why did why did price come down here and

4400
02:50:45,359 --> 02:50:47,439
reject here

4401
02:50:47,439 --> 02:50:50,439
fractal

4402
02:50:50,880 --> 02:50:53,359
right here

4403
02:50:53,600 --> 02:50:55,920
price pushed off of the fractal

4404
02:50:55,920 --> 02:50:57,439
ram the high

4405
02:50:57,439 --> 02:50:59,920
after we run the high what do we do

4406
02:50:59,920 --> 02:51:01,600
since it's an area we're still shorting

4407
02:51:01,600 --> 02:51:03,520
out of we short back down where to

4408
02:51:03,520 --> 02:51:05,760
possibly this s and d here we could have

4409
02:51:05,760 --> 02:51:07,520
some rejection here or we could just

4410
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:09,120
break through it you know the smaller

4411
02:51:09,120 --> 02:51:11,279
ones are usually um

4412
02:51:11,279 --> 02:51:13,040
you know pretty small and for a lot

4413
02:51:13,040 --> 02:51:14,800
anyway

4414
02:51:14,800 --> 02:51:16,319
but we could have a rejection from here

4415
02:51:16,319 --> 02:51:18,479
or we could have a push directly through

4416
02:51:18,479 --> 02:51:20,000
the area

4417
02:51:20,000 --> 02:51:22,960
but just understanding these areas

4418
02:51:22,960 --> 02:51:24,479
can help you

4419
02:51:24,479 --> 02:51:25,279
with

4420
02:51:25,279 --> 02:51:27,200
being able to take trades from it no

4421
02:51:27,200 --> 02:51:29,600
imbalance here so if it runs this low

4422
02:51:29,600 --> 02:51:31,840
we're not expecting it to really stop

4423
02:51:31,840 --> 02:51:34,240
here unless it hits another area of

4424
02:51:34,240 --> 02:51:35,359
interest

4425
02:51:35,359 --> 02:51:38,560
like this supply area somewhere within

4426
02:51:38,560 --> 02:51:41,680
here bam we just touched it

4427
02:51:41,680 --> 02:51:42,800
you know so now we're seeing the

4428
02:51:42,800 --> 02:51:45,200
reaction around the supply area do you

4429
02:51:45,200 --> 02:51:46,880
look at the higher time frame as well to

4430
02:51:46,880 --> 02:51:49,040
get an overall direction yeah so george

4431
02:51:49,040 --> 02:51:52,960
my top downs um i actually start the top

4432
02:51:52,960 --> 02:51:53,840
down

4433
02:51:53,840 --> 02:51:56,399
um you know just with a sense of

4434
02:51:56,399 --> 02:51:58,720
like the overall direction of price and

4435
02:51:58,720 --> 02:52:01,040
then we just work within that so we look

4436
02:52:01,040 --> 02:52:01,920
at

4437
02:52:01,920 --> 02:52:04,399
where price left

4438
02:52:04,399 --> 02:52:07,439
where price left right here

4439
02:52:07,439 --> 02:52:10,000
and where price stalled here

4440
02:52:10,000 --> 02:52:12,000
and now we know we're working

4441
02:52:12,000 --> 02:52:14,880
within the area of here

4442
02:52:14,880 --> 02:52:16,800
and here and like i mentioned from a

4443
02:52:16,800 --> 02:52:18,399
higher time frame

4444
02:52:18,399 --> 02:52:20,720
you might have like you know let let's

4445
02:52:20,720 --> 02:52:23,279
say you you take this area here

4446
02:52:23,279 --> 02:52:25,279
from a higher time frame if you're like

4447
02:52:25,279 --> 02:52:27,920
one of the the stream traders you know

4448
02:52:27,920 --> 02:52:29,840
who who trade from the higher time frame

4449
02:52:29,840 --> 02:52:31,760
and only like they just sit on the

4450
02:52:31,760 --> 02:52:33,680
higher time frame the whole time

4451
02:52:33,680 --> 02:52:35,359
and they trade look at this sorry it was

4452
02:52:35,359 --> 02:52:36,560
a little

4453
02:52:36,560 --> 02:52:38,720
little flash movement

4454
02:52:38,720 --> 02:52:40,640
look at this

4455
02:52:40,640 --> 02:52:42,640
so they see this here and they go oh

4456
02:52:42,640 --> 02:52:44,240
this is sideways ranging this is

4457
02:52:44,240 --> 02:52:46,560
sideways consolidating

4458
02:52:46,560 --> 02:52:49,200
you know so we can't trade this we got

4459
02:52:49,200 --> 02:52:51,040
to wait for a setup

4460
02:52:51,040 --> 02:52:53,279
let's either wait for it to run

4461
02:52:53,279 --> 02:52:56,000
above a high or run below it so they're

4462
02:52:56,000 --> 02:52:58,479
just sitting here spending hours

4463
02:52:58,479 --> 02:52:59,520
you know

4464
02:52:59,520 --> 02:53:01,600
just waiting for some strong movement to

4465
02:53:01,600 --> 02:53:03,760
happen you go oh it's not tradable we

4466
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:05,760
couldn't find a trade today

4467
02:53:05,760 --> 02:53:07,520
you don't have to

4468
02:53:07,520 --> 02:53:08,960
you know like

4469
02:53:08,960 --> 02:53:11,279
you you don't have to do this

4470
02:53:11,279 --> 02:53:13,760
you just use these higher time frames

4471
02:53:13,760 --> 02:53:18,720
for direction overall so we went into um

4472
02:53:18,720 --> 02:53:22,080
we went into the daily

4473
02:53:22,319 --> 02:53:24,960
was it yeah we went into the daily and

4474
02:53:24,960 --> 02:53:26,319
we found

4475
02:53:26,319 --> 02:53:29,120
not just the daily but also the the four

4476
02:53:29,120 --> 02:53:30,800
hour i think of us

4477
02:53:30,800 --> 02:53:34,080
we found i'm sorry that's so

4478
02:53:34,080 --> 02:53:37,200
stuck in there we found different areas

4479
02:53:37,200 --> 02:53:40,080
that price could go to

4480
02:53:40,080 --> 02:53:43,520
so look now you have a wick below this

4481
02:53:43,520 --> 02:53:45,279
area here

4482
02:53:45,279 --> 02:53:48,399
a green wick below this area and then

4483
02:53:48,399 --> 02:53:49,760
you had a push

4484
02:53:49,760 --> 02:53:52,560
up this is the candlestick pattern that

4485
02:53:52,560 --> 02:53:54,319
i told you guys i like to see

4486
02:53:54,319 --> 02:53:56,479
where after it wicks below a certain

4487
02:53:56,479 --> 02:53:58,880
area it starts to push up and flip

4488
02:53:58,880 --> 02:54:01,040
bullish so price could still be flipping

4489
02:54:01,040 --> 02:54:02,640
bullish now and this is just from a

4490
02:54:02,640 --> 02:54:04,399
higher time frame perspective according

4491
02:54:04,399 --> 02:54:07,359
to candlesticks but we also got areas

4492
02:54:07,359 --> 02:54:10,000
from the left that we went to look at

4493
02:54:10,000 --> 02:54:11,920
and see that price could potentially tap

4494
02:54:11,920 --> 02:54:15,279
into so i think our first area was

4495
02:54:15,279 --> 02:54:18,479
was it 8 19

4496
02:54:18,640 --> 02:54:21,520
um

4497
02:54:21,520 --> 02:54:23,840
i don't think it was 8 19.

4498
02:54:23,840 --> 02:54:26,560
it was from the daily so it was like

4499
02:54:26,560 --> 02:54:31,120
8 20 something or or whatever it was um

4500
02:54:31,120 --> 02:54:32,640
if you go back to the beginning of the

4501
02:54:32,640 --> 02:54:34,800
video it it would it would show it but

4502
02:54:34,800 --> 02:54:37,520
it was within this area it was like 8 23

4503
02:54:37,520 --> 02:54:39,359
or something like that so

4504
02:54:39,359 --> 02:54:41,920
it came down you know missed 823 by like

4505
02:54:41,920 --> 02:54:44,160
a couple pips yeah there you go exactly

4506
02:54:44,160 --> 02:54:45,520
8 23.

4507
02:54:45,520 --> 02:54:47,520
i missed it by a couple pips see i i

4508
02:54:47,520 --> 02:54:48,960
know you know what you talk about that

4509
02:54:48,960 --> 02:54:51,120
that's good so it

4510
02:54:51,120 --> 02:54:53,120
it went down to the area

4511
02:54:53,120 --> 02:54:55,200
tapped into the area or near the area

4512
02:54:55,200 --> 02:54:56,960
and then you just started to see it flip

4513
02:54:56,960 --> 02:54:57,920
back up

4514
02:54:57,920 --> 02:54:59,760
we took we mentioned that when we get to

4515
02:54:59,760 --> 02:55:01,680
certain areas we like to see this

4516
02:55:01,680 --> 02:55:04,399
candlestick pattern where price flicks

4517
02:55:04,399 --> 02:55:06,000
below

4518
02:55:06,000 --> 02:55:08,080
the wick to the left and then trades

4519
02:55:08,080 --> 02:55:10,240
back up above it so now we could

4520
02:55:10,240 --> 02:55:12,720
essentially be targeting the area that

4521
02:55:12,720 --> 02:55:15,200
that we were looking to target

4522
02:55:15,200 --> 02:55:18,240
above which was 101

4523
02:55:18,240 --> 02:55:22,399
but then we could also look to target

4524
02:55:22,479 --> 02:55:26,080
you know as akeem says the ohlc

4525
02:55:26,080 --> 02:55:30,160
we could look to target either that

4526
02:55:30,160 --> 02:55:32,960
the the high

4527
02:55:32,960 --> 02:55:35,359
or we could look to target

4528
02:55:35,359 --> 02:55:37,439
the open

4529
02:55:37,439 --> 02:55:39,359
and those are potential areas that price

4530
02:55:39,359 --> 02:55:42,080
could touch but can price just tap

4531
02:55:42,080 --> 02:55:46,000
between this area yes it can

4532
02:55:46,000 --> 02:55:48,640
because the high and the low of the area

4533
02:55:48,640 --> 02:55:49,920
will give you

4534
02:55:49,920 --> 02:55:52,960
the midway point of this area so if we

4535
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:57,040
took the high and the low of this area

4536
02:55:57,120 --> 02:55:59,840
one here

4537
02:56:01,359 --> 02:56:03,279
took the low here

4538
02:56:03,279 --> 02:56:05,200
let's drag it out here

4539
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:07,600
look at where we're spinning some uh

4540
02:56:07,600 --> 02:56:11,800
resistance at right now

4541
02:56:12,479 --> 02:56:15,520
eight what is this zero eight six

4542
02:56:15,520 --> 02:56:19,439
so let's get a line into zero eight six

4543
02:56:19,439 --> 02:56:20,560
right here

4544
02:56:20,560 --> 02:56:22,240
now let's go down to the higher time

4545
02:56:22,240 --> 02:56:23,279
frame

4546
02:56:23,279 --> 02:56:24,840
of zero eight

4547
02:56:24,840 --> 02:56:28,399
six and let's take a look at where we

4548
02:56:28,399 --> 02:56:30,640
are

4549
02:56:33,760 --> 02:56:36,560
move this out

4550
02:56:37,920 --> 02:56:41,040
look at where we get our rejection from

4551
02:56:41,040 --> 02:56:43,840
not only 086 but we tapped into the 101

4552
02:56:43,840 --> 02:56:45,520
area now i'm not saying that these

4553
02:56:45,520 --> 02:56:47,840
rejections are going to hold here

4554
02:56:47,840 --> 02:56:50,240
but these are biases

4555
02:56:50,240 --> 02:56:52,560
that you pick up and you begin to look

4556
02:56:52,560 --> 02:56:55,760
at where price can go what area price

4557
02:56:55,760 --> 02:56:57,600
can go in so this is just higher time

4558
02:56:57,600 --> 02:56:59,920
frame bias

4559
02:56:59,920 --> 02:57:01,600
you know and and you're paying attention

4560
02:57:01,600 --> 02:57:03,439
to what's going on within that higher

4561
02:57:03,439 --> 02:57:05,040
time frame bias and you're catching

4562
02:57:05,040 --> 02:57:07,439
little moves from that so look we

4563
02:57:07,439 --> 02:57:09,120
mentioned that we can get a rejection

4564
02:57:09,120 --> 02:57:11,359
out of here we did get a rejection from

4565
02:57:11,359 --> 02:57:12,319
here

4566
02:57:12,319 --> 02:57:14,319
at at this particular line

4567
02:57:14,319 --> 02:57:15,680
right here

4568
02:57:15,680 --> 02:57:19,279
sizable rejection too 61 pips then look

4569
02:57:19,279 --> 02:57:20,960
we get another rejection out of this

4570
02:57:20,960 --> 02:57:24,160
area what are we at 43 pips already

4571
02:57:24,160 --> 02:57:29,279
from just having this area on our chart

4572
02:57:29,359 --> 02:57:31,760
like this

4573
02:57:33,359 --> 02:57:36,000
so so the higher time frames yes they

4574
02:57:36,000 --> 02:57:38,160
they show us you know what could

4575
02:57:38,160 --> 02:57:40,720
potentially be happening yes

4576
02:57:40,720 --> 02:57:43,840
the higher time frames show us that

4577
02:57:43,840 --> 02:57:46,399
the lower time frames essentially

4578
02:57:46,399 --> 02:57:48,479
like give you the more detailed work of

4579
02:57:48,479 --> 02:57:50,479
heading there but the higher time frames

4580
02:57:50,479 --> 02:57:52,640
gives you that bias to help you

4581
02:57:52,640 --> 02:57:54,960
understand that so i i do give people

4582
02:57:54,960 --> 02:57:57,359
trades from higher time frames too

4583
02:57:57,359 --> 02:57:59,520
you know i do not trades first of all

4584
02:57:59,520 --> 02:58:00,800
let me tell you guys that i'm not a

4585
02:58:00,800 --> 02:58:03,120
financial advisor

4586
02:58:03,120 --> 02:58:06,080
local and federal law requires

4587
02:58:06,080 --> 02:58:08,880
one who is in need of financial advice

4588
02:58:08,880 --> 02:58:12,240
to find their financial advice from

4589
02:58:12,240 --> 02:58:15,200
licensed financial advisors

4590
02:58:15,200 --> 02:58:17,439
i am not a licensed financial advisor i

4591
02:58:17,439 --> 02:58:20,000
cannot give out financial information

4592
02:58:20,000 --> 02:58:22,160
the information that i give

4593
02:58:22,160 --> 02:58:24,000
is only

4594
02:58:24,000 --> 02:58:26,960
for educational purposes

4595
02:58:26,960 --> 02:58:30,000
and not intended to be used

4596
02:58:30,000 --> 02:58:33,200
in the markets for financial advice i

4597
02:58:33,200 --> 02:58:34,960
need to put that disclaimer out each and

4598
02:58:34,960 --> 02:58:36,479
every time don't need anybody trying to

4599
02:58:36,479 --> 02:58:38,080
sue me because they're like oh well you

4600
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:40,000
said it was shorting here and it didn't

4601
02:58:40,000 --> 02:58:42,399
so you know because people sue people

4602
02:58:42,399 --> 02:58:44,399
people sue people for anything here in

4603
02:58:44,399 --> 02:58:46,479
america

4604
02:58:46,479 --> 02:58:48,479
anything

4605
02:58:48,479 --> 02:58:51,040
here in america they sue people for so

4606
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:53,470
look this is an imbalance here

4607
02:58:53,470 --> 02:58:56,479
[Laughter]

4608
02:58:56,479 --> 02:58:58,560
i need to be able to back myself up in

4609
02:58:58,560 --> 02:59:00,479
court so i leave these receipts just in

4610
02:59:00,479 --> 02:59:02,800
case anybody tries it

4611
02:59:02,800 --> 02:59:05,359
but look you gotta tap into this area

4612
02:59:05,359 --> 02:59:07,120
in the imbalance this is why i say the

4613
02:59:07,120 --> 02:59:08,640
imbalances are important like pay

4614
02:59:08,640 --> 02:59:10,479
attention to it they are not just

4615
02:59:10,479 --> 02:59:12,319
they're not only areas to hold trades

4616
02:59:12,319 --> 02:59:14,080
from sometimes they may turn into a long

4617
02:59:14,080 --> 02:59:16,000
trade depending on how

4618
02:59:16,000 --> 02:59:18,880
how um how much momentum comes out of it

4619
02:59:18,880 --> 02:59:20,479
you know if you feel comfortable staying

4620
02:59:20,479 --> 02:59:24,160
in but this tapped into this imbalance

4621
02:59:24,160 --> 02:59:25,600
so most people might be looking for it

4622
02:59:25,600 --> 02:59:27,359
to come down to somewhere within this

4623
02:59:27,359 --> 02:59:29,439
area but no we tapped into some balance

4624
02:59:29,439 --> 02:59:31,439
what did i say here i said we can come

4625
02:59:31,439 --> 02:59:33,680
to this s and d here we could either

4626
02:59:33,680 --> 02:59:35,600
come to this but if we blow past this we

4627
02:59:35,600 --> 02:59:37,439
could be coming to this one what do we

4628
02:59:37,439 --> 02:59:39,920
do tap into this area here

4629
02:59:39,920 --> 02:59:40,960
and then

4630
02:59:40,960 --> 02:59:44,560
we left up to where the next target here

4631
02:59:44,560 --> 02:59:46,319
we tap here and get rejected what's the

4632
02:59:46,319 --> 02:59:48,479
next target here

4633
02:59:48,479 --> 02:59:50,160
at this area

4634
02:59:50,160 --> 02:59:52,560
next target is the imbalance after the

4635
02:59:52,560 --> 02:59:55,680
imbalance what's the next target

4636
02:59:55,680 --> 02:59:57,840
here

4637
02:59:58,000 --> 03:00:00,720
this area here

4638
03:00:00,720 --> 03:00:03,600
why is this the next target

4639
03:00:03,600 --> 03:00:05,760
the top of here why is this the next

4640
03:00:05,760 --> 03:00:06,800
target

4641
03:00:06,800 --> 03:00:09,120
here

4642
03:00:09,359 --> 03:00:11,040
because everybody's probably wondering

4643
03:00:11,040 --> 03:00:13,600
like what how did you even find that

4644
03:00:13,600 --> 03:00:15,920
area

4645
03:00:16,080 --> 03:00:18,560
this here

4646
03:00:18,880 --> 03:00:21,439
stops behind here

4647
03:00:21,439 --> 03:00:24,880
potentially shorting

4648
03:00:24,880 --> 03:00:26,560
could be this little s and d if it goes

4649
03:00:26,560 --> 03:00:28,560
past this then it could go down to one

4650
03:00:28,560 --> 03:00:30,960
of the snds down here

4651
03:00:30,960 --> 03:00:33,200
because the imbalance already cleared

4652
03:00:33,200 --> 03:00:35,120
why are we shorting from here

4653
03:00:35,120 --> 03:00:36,640
why

4654
03:00:36,640 --> 03:00:38,800
why do we choose to find a short from

4655
03:00:38,800 --> 03:00:40,240
this area

4656
03:00:40,240 --> 03:00:42,800
we chose to find a short from this area

4657
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:44,560
yes this this

4658
03:00:44,560 --> 03:00:47,600
liquidity above this area there's more

4659
03:00:47,600 --> 03:00:50,000
orders within like pending orders within

4660
03:00:50,000 --> 03:00:52,560
this area but remember what i mentioned

4661
03:00:52,560 --> 03:00:55,359
candlestick structure when it gets to

4662
03:00:55,359 --> 03:00:58,240
your area start paying attention to

4663
03:00:58,240 --> 03:01:00,960
candlestick structure

4664
03:01:00,960 --> 03:01:03,279
candlestick structure what do i mean by

4665
03:01:03,279 --> 03:01:05,760
that and i continue to to spell this out

4666
03:01:05,760 --> 03:01:08,240
for you guys so you guys understand

4667
03:01:08,240 --> 03:01:10,560
we get a high right here we take a low

4668
03:01:10,560 --> 03:01:12,640
here we put in another high and what do

4669
03:01:12,640 --> 03:01:15,920
we do we run the low

4670
03:01:16,160 --> 03:01:18,160
we even run the low with

4671
03:01:18,160 --> 03:01:22,560
with um we we run the low here

4672
03:01:22,560 --> 03:01:24,479
and then we come back into this area

4673
03:01:24,479 --> 03:01:25,359
here

4674
03:01:25,359 --> 03:01:27,840
we tap into this area again and short

4675
03:01:27,840 --> 03:01:30,319
from it but we return to this area a

4676
03:01:30,319 --> 03:01:31,760
second time

4677
03:01:31,760 --> 03:01:34,960
now for me i like to see body closures

4678
03:01:34,960 --> 03:01:37,120
below the low

4679
03:01:37,120 --> 03:01:39,840
that is ran so this low is ran a wick

4680
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:41,200
came out of it

4681
03:01:41,200 --> 03:01:43,279
that's fine you know sometimes you can

4682
03:01:43,279 --> 03:01:45,680
get the wick but sometimes there's also

4683
03:01:45,680 --> 03:01:47,439
um

4684
03:01:47,439 --> 03:01:49,520
some sort of um

4685
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:51,520
uh uh

4686
03:01:51,520 --> 03:01:54,080
like fake out it could potentially be

4687
03:01:54,080 --> 03:01:55,760
just using the wick so i like to see the

4688
03:01:55,760 --> 03:01:57,520
body closures sometimes the body

4689
03:01:57,520 --> 03:01:59,279
closures it also doesn't come back to

4690
03:01:59,279 --> 03:02:02,800
the area but with the body closures what

4691
03:02:02,800 --> 03:02:04,640
you what you have to understand is it's

4692
03:02:04,640 --> 03:02:06,399
given a stronger indication that price

4693
03:02:06,399 --> 03:02:09,760
is pulling away from that area so

4694
03:02:09,760 --> 03:02:12,080
you get the body closure out of the area

4695
03:02:12,080 --> 03:02:16,399
price trades back up into this area

4696
03:02:16,399 --> 03:02:20,080
this wick is here

4697
03:02:20,080 --> 03:02:23,200
as a a supply area

4698
03:02:23,200 --> 03:02:24,479
you know there's a there's a hidden

4699
03:02:24,479 --> 03:02:26,640
supply above

4700
03:02:26,640 --> 03:02:29,520
right let me

4701
03:02:29,520 --> 03:02:31,840
right here

4702
03:02:39,279 --> 03:02:41,600
there's a hidden supply up here

4703
03:02:41,600 --> 03:02:44,479
often times when price trades away

4704
03:02:44,479 --> 03:02:47,359
it'll tap into the body of the area

4705
03:02:47,359 --> 03:02:49,439
and leave but it also leaves behind this

4706
03:02:49,439 --> 03:02:51,439
hidden supply area

4707
03:02:51,439 --> 03:02:53,680
and sometimes when people are engaging

4708
03:02:53,680 --> 03:02:54,960
in shorts

4709
03:02:54,960 --> 03:02:56,880
down from this area

4710
03:02:56,880 --> 03:02:58,960
oftentimes you get a tap back into the

4711
03:02:58,960 --> 03:03:01,520
supply area and if anybody had their

4712
03:03:01,520 --> 03:03:03,359
stops behind any of these areas that

4713
03:03:03,359 --> 03:03:05,040
they begin to shorten

4714
03:03:05,040 --> 03:03:08,399
they all get ruptured

4715
03:03:08,640 --> 03:03:10,479
they tap into the area they all get

4716
03:03:10,479 --> 03:03:13,359
ruptured to tap back into there

4717
03:03:13,359 --> 03:03:16,080
before trading

4718
03:03:16,080 --> 03:03:17,920
further down i don't know why this isn't

4719
03:03:17,920 --> 03:03:20,160
clicking for me but before trading

4720
03:03:20,160 --> 03:03:21,840
further down

4721
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:23,120
further down

4722
03:03:23,120 --> 03:03:26,080
into like an area down there

4723
03:03:26,080 --> 03:03:27,840
you know so that can happen if price

4724
03:03:27,840 --> 03:03:30,319
comes back to your area a second time

4725
03:03:30,319 --> 03:03:32,160
that can happen

4726
03:03:32,160 --> 03:03:35,680
and on a lower time frame

4727
03:03:36,880 --> 03:03:39,600
on a lower time frame this ultimately

4728
03:03:39,600 --> 03:03:42,640
right here this little area

4729
03:03:42,640 --> 03:03:45,200
on like the seconds time frame this area

4730
03:03:45,200 --> 03:03:46,240
here

4731
03:03:46,240 --> 03:03:47,200
is

4732
03:03:47,200 --> 03:03:49,680
an equal high

4733
03:03:49,680 --> 03:03:52,240
and i always say that oftentimes the

4734
03:03:52,240 --> 03:03:55,439
equal highs result in at least a run of

4735
03:03:55,439 --> 03:03:57,040
the first low

4736
03:03:57,040 --> 03:03:57,920
which

4737
03:03:57,920 --> 03:04:01,600
we ran that first low here

4738
03:04:02,160 --> 03:04:04,000
you know and now we we do have some

4739
03:04:04,000 --> 03:04:06,319
stagnation within this area like i said

4740
03:04:06,319 --> 03:04:09,520
it could push back up to tap into this

4741
03:04:09,520 --> 03:04:12,399
supply area here before finally going

4742
03:04:12,399 --> 03:04:15,359
short or it can just go short

4743
03:04:15,359 --> 03:04:18,000
you know to one of these areas possibly

4744
03:04:18,000 --> 03:04:20,880
before going long again to possibly take

4745
03:04:20,880 --> 03:04:23,760
out some more highs

4746
03:04:23,760 --> 03:04:25,920
you know we have this area here this is

4747
03:04:25,920 --> 03:04:28,240
the daily high

4748
03:04:28,240 --> 03:04:31,279
this 156 area

4749
03:04:31,279 --> 03:04:32,960
this is the daily high usually when

4750
03:04:32,960 --> 03:04:35,120
these daily highs and lows are ran

4751
03:04:35,120 --> 03:04:38,000
it runs it and then you have like a huge

4752
03:04:38,000 --> 03:04:40,479
push down from that area

4753
03:04:40,479 --> 03:04:43,680
like a huge sell-off or i don't know why

4754
03:04:43,680 --> 03:04:45,600
i don't know you know

4755
03:04:45,600 --> 03:04:47,359
what the reason is behind that it could

4756
03:04:47,359 --> 03:04:48,240
be just

4757
03:04:48,240 --> 03:04:50,800
as as he mentioned the liquidity it can

4758
03:04:50,800 --> 03:04:52,560
be the buy stops that are that are being

4759
03:04:52,560 --> 03:04:54,800
activated you know they're for string

4760
03:04:54,800 --> 03:04:57,200
for swing traders you know

4761
03:04:57,200 --> 03:04:58,479
just people

4762
03:04:58,479 --> 03:05:00,720
not knowing like people think that just

4763
03:05:00,720 --> 03:05:02,319
because this highest ran it's going to

4764
03:05:02,319 --> 03:05:05,680
go higher and that's not necessarily the

4765
03:05:05,680 --> 03:05:07,120
truth

4766
03:05:07,120 --> 03:05:08,560
that doesn't mean that it's gonna go

4767
03:05:08,560 --> 03:05:09,439
higher

4768
03:05:09,439 --> 03:05:11,680
just because a high is taken out

4769
03:05:11,680 --> 03:05:13,680
sometimes a high can be taken out and it

4770
03:05:13,680 --> 03:05:17,600
immediately like starts trading heavily

4771
03:05:17,600 --> 03:05:19,600
below the law

4772
03:05:19,600 --> 03:05:23,120
like look this high was ran here

4773
03:05:23,200 --> 03:05:25,359
this was yesterday

4774
03:05:25,359 --> 03:05:26,560
fomc

4775
03:05:26,560 --> 03:05:28,000
this hype was ran

4776
03:05:28,000 --> 03:05:30,240
after this high was ran

4777
03:05:30,240 --> 03:05:34,080
and this i also ran some highs back here

4778
03:05:34,080 --> 03:05:35,520
this high is red let's say you were

4779
03:05:35,520 --> 03:05:38,720
using this this i was brand

4780
03:05:38,720 --> 03:05:40,240
this high is ran

4781
03:05:40,240 --> 03:05:42,720
and immediately look at how we tank

4782
03:05:42,720 --> 03:05:46,800
down below look at how we sell off

4783
03:05:46,800 --> 03:05:48,319
immediately after this

4784
03:05:48,319 --> 03:05:50,319
this time was around

4785
03:05:50,319 --> 03:05:52,800
so you don't look to get in just because

4786
03:05:52,800 --> 03:05:55,439
you see a high being ran

4787
03:05:55,439 --> 03:05:57,200
you look to get in

4788
03:05:57,200 --> 03:05:58,720
because of

4789
03:05:58,720 --> 03:06:00,479
structure because of what you're

4790
03:06:00,479 --> 03:06:01,920
understanding

4791
03:06:01,920 --> 03:06:05,200
maybe there's an area above that high

4792
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:08,160
that price can potentially tap

4793
03:06:08,160 --> 03:06:10,560
and then go short from that area

4794
03:06:10,560 --> 03:06:12,000
so you want to pay attention to those

4795
03:06:12,000 --> 03:06:13,600

you know they're able to understand like

4800
03:06:22,800 --> 03:06:24,479

4801
03:06:24,479 --> 03:06:26,560

03:07:22,000 --> 03:07:22,960
level

4828
03:07:22,960 --> 03:07:24,399

4847
03:08:12,399 --> 03:08:13,840
yeah like you know

4848
03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:16,720
this information is is life-changing so

4849
03:08:16,720 --> 03:08:19,600
look we mentioned the short here

4850
03:08:19,600 --> 03:08:21,120
we mentioned the possibility of coming

4851
03:08:21,120 --> 03:08:22,880
back up to this s and d

4852
03:08:22,880 --> 03:08:25,600
but then we also mentioned coming down

4853
03:08:25,600 --> 03:08:28,640
to this one here

4854
03:08:28,640 --> 03:08:30,960
so look now we we make it down to this

4855
03:08:30,960 --> 03:08:31,840
one

4856
03:08:31,840 --> 03:08:33,840
and you want to see what it does within

4857
03:08:33,840 --> 03:08:37,040
this area within this smd we already got

4858
03:08:37,040 --> 03:08:39,760
to the midpoint of it if you wanted to

4859
03:08:39,760 --> 03:08:42,319
take us to the midpoint the 74 pips just

4860
03:08:42,319 --> 03:08:44,160
from the top of that

4861
03:08:44,160 --> 03:08:46,319
i told you if you get in on these taps

4862
03:08:46,319 --> 03:08:49,359
of the lines up here

4863
03:08:49,359 --> 03:08:52,640
let's say it tap here

4864
03:08:52,640 --> 03:08:53,840
and i mentioned this yesterday if it

4865
03:08:53,840 --> 03:08:55,680
taps here and it starts to consolidate

4866
03:08:55,680 --> 03:08:56,720
down here

4867
03:08:56,720 --> 03:08:59,359
this is none of your business

4868
03:08:59,359 --> 03:09:02,000
because this is moving up and down in an

4869
03:09:02,000 --> 03:09:04,640
area that you're already in profiting

4870
03:09:04,640 --> 03:09:06,319
absolutely none of your business was

4871
03:09:06,319 --> 03:09:08,479
going on here now if it starts to pull

4872
03:09:08,479 --> 03:09:10,960
back up into this area and possibly run

4873
03:09:10,960 --> 03:09:13,359
this high right here then maybe it

4874
03:09:13,359 --> 03:09:15,120
starts to become your business because

4875
03:09:15,120 --> 03:09:17,680
this is you know seven eight pips away

4876
03:09:17,680 --> 03:09:19,520
from your entry but if your entries

4877
03:09:19,520 --> 03:09:21,680
already locked that break even

4878
03:09:21,680 --> 03:09:23,680
then you're fine you're just watching

4879
03:09:23,680 --> 03:09:25,840
what's going on in this trade

4880
03:09:25,840 --> 03:09:28,000
then you come to some of these areas and

4881
03:09:28,000 --> 03:09:29,680
you see okay

4882
03:09:29,680 --> 03:09:31,279
what did we say

4883
03:09:31,279 --> 03:09:34,319
we said this could be an equal high on

4884
03:09:34,319 --> 03:09:37,040
the the lower time frame

4885
03:09:37,040 --> 03:09:39,279
so if we get an equal high

4886
03:09:39,279 --> 03:09:42,880
we result in the run of not just one low

4887
03:09:42,880 --> 03:09:44,399
but the second low

4888
03:09:44,399 --> 03:09:46,560
so now if your

4889
03:09:46,560 --> 03:09:47,840
if your um

4890
03:09:47,840 --> 03:09:49,760
trade is down to the second low here

4891
03:09:49,760 --> 03:09:51,760
look at this

4892
03:09:51,760 --> 03:09:53,520
89 pips

4893
03:09:53,520 --> 03:09:57,800
and you were only risking 23.

4894
03:09:58,000 --> 03:10:01,200
you got there in

4895
03:10:01,920 --> 03:10:04,960
10 11 minutes

4896
03:10:05,200 --> 03:10:08,239
just because one you notice the area

4897
03:10:08,239 --> 03:10:10,319
two you notice the candlestick pattern

4898
03:10:10,319 --> 03:10:12,640
happen in the area

4899
03:10:12,640 --> 03:10:15,040
three if if so if you got into this

4900
03:10:15,040 --> 03:10:18,479
scalp on this area

4901
03:10:18,479 --> 03:10:20,160
you know let's say you scalp here you

4902
03:10:20,160 --> 03:10:21,680
hit the imbalance

4903
03:10:21,680 --> 03:10:23,680
you partial out 50 or 80 percent of your

4904
03:10:23,680 --> 03:10:25,359
order cool

4905
03:10:25,359 --> 03:10:27,680
price comes back up into the area oh

4906
03:10:27,680 --> 03:10:29,359
we're finding some resistance looks like

4907
03:10:29,359 --> 03:10:32,000
an equal high

4908
03:10:32,000 --> 03:10:34,880
you got a second opportunity to get in

4909
03:10:34,880 --> 03:10:36,160
and then and

4910
03:10:36,160 --> 03:10:38,479
and the equal high was created as a

4911
03:10:38,479 --> 03:10:41,920
result of the retracement back into the

4912
03:10:41,920 --> 03:10:44,239
area before leaving after we violated

4913
03:10:44,239 --> 03:10:46,080
the low on the candlestick level so now

4914
03:10:46,080 --> 03:10:48,560
you have a second entry here

4915
03:10:48,560 --> 03:10:50,640
now your second entry becomes the longer

4916
03:10:50,640 --> 03:10:51,760
entry

4917
03:10:51,760 --> 03:10:54,399
into some of these areas here

4918
03:10:54,399 --> 03:10:56,080
but when price gets to these areas

4919
03:10:56,080 --> 03:10:58,239
you're not getting out just because it

4920
03:10:58,239 --> 03:11:00,479
gets to these areas

4921
03:11:00,479 --> 03:11:02,960
what you're doing is you're looking to

4922
03:11:02,960 --> 03:11:04,080
see

4923
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:06,319
what's gonna happen when it gets into

4924
03:11:06,319 --> 03:11:08,720
these areas and if the areas are already

4925
03:11:08,720 --> 03:11:11,920
mitigated then you don't care about them

4926
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:14,640
you're looking to go further into those

4927
03:11:14,640 --> 03:11:15,680
areas

4928
03:11:15,680 --> 03:11:18,000
and you want to go into an unmitigated

4929
03:11:18,000 --> 03:11:21,040
area and see okay what can price do

4930
03:11:21,040 --> 03:11:24,800
within this area this area is is either

4931
03:11:24,800 --> 03:11:27,520
mitigated unmitigated whatever it is you

4932
03:11:27,520 --> 03:11:29,760
know what is price gonna show me are we

4933
03:11:29,760 --> 03:11:31,120
start are we gonna start to get some

4934
03:11:31,120 --> 03:11:33,040
sideways movement like this

4935
03:11:33,040 --> 03:11:34,960
into the area are we gonna get it to the

4936
03:11:34,960 --> 03:11:36,479
downside

4937
03:11:36,479 --> 03:11:38,560
not sure but we wait

4938
03:11:38,560 --> 03:11:41,040
but what are we we're

4939
03:11:41,040 --> 03:11:44,080
98 pips in profit from the area that we

4940
03:11:44,080 --> 03:11:46,319
just saw price trade away from

4941
03:11:46,319 --> 03:11:48,479
and this this is all consolidation so

4942
03:11:48,479 --> 03:11:50,640
everybody's like oh consolidation

4943
03:11:50,640 --> 03:11:52,399
you know you can't trade that you have

4944
03:11:52,399 --> 03:11:53,760
to wait until

4945
03:11:53,760 --> 03:11:56,560
you know you see what happens with it

4946
03:11:56,560 --> 03:11:59,279
you know this that's not true

4947
03:11:59,279 --> 03:12:01,359
consolidation is telling you a story on

4948
03:12:01,359 --> 03:12:03,040
the inside of there

4949
03:12:03,040 --> 03:12:05,760
and you need to be able to understand

4950
03:12:05,760 --> 03:12:08,479
what's being said of that story that

4951
03:12:08,479 --> 03:12:11,040
consolidation is telling you so

4952
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:13,840
with here we have an area here

4953
03:12:13,840 --> 03:12:16,239
that price just tapped into

4954
03:12:16,239 --> 03:12:18,640
right here

4955
03:12:18,640 --> 03:12:20,640
if you wanted that to be your short and

4956
03:12:20,640 --> 03:12:22,479
you're out cool

4957
03:12:22,479 --> 03:12:24,080
we got the little candlestick pattern

4958
03:12:24,080 --> 03:12:26,720
that we usually see with wicks below

4959
03:12:26,720 --> 03:12:29,040
the area to the left and then pulls back

4960
03:12:29,040 --> 03:12:31,040
inside of it you want to make sure that

4961
03:12:31,040 --> 03:12:33,359
it pulls back inside of the range and

4962
03:12:33,359 --> 03:12:36,800
closes within the range of that candle

4963
03:12:36,800 --> 03:12:41,600
it looks better from the the one hour

4964
03:12:41,760 --> 03:12:45,160
let me see

4965
03:12:54,399 --> 03:12:56,960
so so this area

4966
03:12:56,960 --> 03:12:58,239
if

4967
03:12:58,239 --> 03:13:00,640
if you look within this area yeah this

4968
03:13:00,640 --> 03:13:03,359
this tap is consistent with the one hour

4969
03:13:03,359 --> 03:13:06,880
because if you look right here

4970
03:13:06,880 --> 03:13:09,359
this is where the tap is

4971
03:13:09,359 --> 03:13:11,120
for the hourly this is what i would have

4972
03:13:11,120 --> 03:13:12,640
saw from the hourly and this is what i'm

4973
03:13:12,640 --> 03:13:14,239
saying these these streamers that be out

4974
03:13:14,239 --> 03:13:16,160
there streaming and they really don't

4975
03:13:16,160 --> 03:13:17,359
like they're not

4976
03:13:17,359 --> 03:13:19,680
they're not any at any expert levels

4977
03:13:19,680 --> 03:13:21,840
they really don't understand um what

4978
03:13:21,840 --> 03:13:24,000
they're doing they're trying to to teach

4979
03:13:24,000 --> 03:13:26,399
what they know and trying to

4980
03:13:26,399 --> 03:13:28,479
help people make money or whatever it is

4981
03:13:28,479 --> 03:13:30,080
they say they're doing but you know you

4982
03:13:30,080 --> 03:13:32,000
you got to be at a certain level of

4983
03:13:32,000 --> 03:13:34,880
expertise to to like get into financial

4984
03:13:34,880 --> 03:13:37,680
markets help people and not have them

4985
03:13:37,680 --> 03:13:39,439
you know lose the money that they're

4986
03:13:39,439 --> 03:13:41,680
losing like you got to be really good at

4987
03:13:41,680 --> 03:13:44,640
what they what you do and and for me i'm

4988
03:13:44,640 --> 03:13:47,040
that's the way i am you know like

4989
03:13:47,040 --> 03:13:49,120
i mean i'm i'm jamaican

4990
03:13:49,120 --> 03:13:51,279
you know jamaicans are perfectionists

4991
03:13:51,279 --> 03:13:53,840
you know like they they

4992
03:13:53,840 --> 03:13:55,600
everything has to be speaking span

4993
03:13:55,600 --> 03:13:57,840
everything has to be you know it has to

4994
03:13:57,840 --> 03:14:01,279
be a certain way it's we're just not

4995
03:14:01,279 --> 03:14:02,800
i don't know maybe it's a cultural thing

4996
03:14:02,800 --> 03:14:04,720
maybe it's the work ethic or whatever it

4997
03:14:04,720 --> 03:14:06,960
is but look it taps on this line how

4998
03:14:06,960 --> 03:14:08,800
much drawdown do we get on this

4999
03:14:08,800 --> 03:14:12,080
four pips from an hourly area

5000
03:14:12,080 --> 03:14:13,680
and where are we

5001
03:14:13,680 --> 03:14:14,800
here

5002
03:14:14,800 --> 03:14:17,120
we've already gone what down to here

5003
03:14:17,120 --> 03:14:19,040
136 pips

5004
03:14:19,040 --> 03:14:22,720
since tapping this area

5005
03:14:22,720 --> 03:14:26,160
since tapping this area from the hourly

5006
03:14:26,160 --> 03:14:29,760
just with this this one wick alone

5007
03:14:29,760 --> 03:14:32,479
and what how did we gain some idea that

5008
03:14:32,479 --> 03:14:34,880
price would come up and tap into this

5009
03:14:34,880 --> 03:14:37,120
with our zones

5010
03:14:37,120 --> 03:14:39,600
and how we choose them

5011
03:14:39,600 --> 03:14:41,920
and once we're able to find out how to

5012
03:14:41,920 --> 03:14:43,840
choose the zones

5013
03:14:43,840 --> 03:14:46,800
see how did i mark that area

5014
03:14:46,800 --> 03:14:48,479
i took this low

5015
03:14:48,479 --> 03:14:50,160
to this high

5016
03:14:50,160 --> 03:14:51,279
but

5017
03:14:51,279 --> 03:14:53,439
i took it to the body

5018
03:14:53,439 --> 03:14:54,800
because

5019
03:14:54,800 --> 03:14:58,000
when price traded above this area and

5020
03:14:58,000 --> 03:15:01,040
came back in

5021
03:15:01,040 --> 03:15:03,600
that's when i noticed that price wanted

5022
03:15:03,600 --> 03:15:05,279
to come down remember how i mentioned

5023
03:15:05,279 --> 03:15:07,359
these candlestick patterns of you know

5024
03:15:07,359 --> 03:15:09,439
price pushing up above a high and then

5025
03:15:09,439 --> 03:15:11,840
trading back within it and then shorting

5026
03:15:11,840 --> 03:15:13,600
from that area so if you want if you

5027
03:15:13,600 --> 03:15:15,120
were on an hourly and you saw a price

5028
03:15:15,120 --> 03:15:16,800
tap into this snd

5029
03:15:16,800 --> 03:15:19,040
pushed up in this area came back in and

5030
03:15:19,040 --> 03:15:21,200
you began to short you can get in on the

5031
03:15:21,200 --> 03:15:22,960
next candle here look there's some

5032
03:15:22,960 --> 03:15:24,720
bullish bullish movement here something

5033
03:15:24,720 --> 03:15:26,080
is happening with price this could be

5034
03:15:26,080 --> 03:15:27,600
fundamentals too

5035
03:15:27,600 --> 03:15:28,319
but

5036
03:15:28,319 --> 03:15:31,439
you know you you had this this um push

5037
03:15:31,439 --> 03:15:34,239
up it came back in the next candle opens

5038
03:15:34,239 --> 03:15:36,720
you can get in on with stops behind here

5039
03:15:36,720 --> 03:15:39,680
and this would have been market open

5040
03:15:39,680 --> 03:15:41,279
and you would have been able to take it

5041
03:15:41,279 --> 03:15:43,520
all the way down to the area that we

5042
03:15:43,520 --> 03:15:45,680
mentioned price was coming to

5043
03:15:45,680 --> 03:15:47,680
all the way down to here

5044
03:15:47,680 --> 03:15:49,600
so look at how we just quickly recovered

5045
03:15:49,600 --> 03:15:51,279
let's go to one minute and see what that

5046
03:15:51,279 --> 03:15:53,600
looks like

5047
03:15:53,600 --> 03:15:55,600
look at look at this look at this come

5048
03:15:55,600 --> 03:15:58,479
on look at this this is

5049
03:15:58,479 --> 03:16:01,120
i just mentioned that price tapped this

5050
03:16:01,120 --> 03:16:03,200
line right here

5051
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:05,439
this line i i said that these lines are

5052
03:16:05,439 --> 03:16:08,640
targets but these lines are also entries

5053
03:16:08,640 --> 03:16:10,640
look at this

5054
03:16:10,640 --> 03:16:14,080
oh my gosh like

5055
03:16:14,640 --> 03:16:17,040
look at this huge move up you see how i

5056
03:16:17,040 --> 03:16:19,840
said scalps can turn into long movements

5057
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:21,600
if you just know the areas that you're

5058
03:16:21,600 --> 03:16:22,960
getting into

5059
03:16:22,960 --> 03:16:25,359
scalps can turn into long movements

5060
03:16:25,359 --> 03:16:28,000
look at this huge push up

5061
03:16:28,000 --> 03:16:31,200
out of this area within a matter of four

5062
03:16:31,200 --> 03:16:32,319
minutes

5063
03:16:32,319 --> 03:16:34,160
four minutes

5064
03:16:34,160 --> 03:16:38,160
after it touched this line here

5065
03:16:38,160 --> 03:16:41,600
like yes yes wicked literally with the

5066
03:16:41,600 --> 03:16:44,600
wick

5067
03:16:45,200 --> 03:16:47,760
i want to see price come tap into the

5068
03:16:47,760 --> 03:16:50,319
area but it has to come below

5069
03:16:50,319 --> 03:16:51,760
this low

5070
03:16:51,760 --> 03:16:54,080
and then trade back within the range and

5071
03:16:54,080 --> 03:16:56,560
then i know that it's a push up

5072
03:16:56,560 --> 03:16:59,359
i call that the liquidity grab candle

5073
03:16:59,359 --> 03:17:01,920
where it's grabbing the stops real quick

5074
03:17:01,920 --> 03:17:03,840
i told you within an area that is making

5075
03:17:03,840 --> 03:17:06,319
lows you see a huge stab and then a

5076
03:17:06,319 --> 03:17:07,920
trade away from it

5077
03:17:07,920 --> 03:17:10,880
that's exactly what happened here so

5078
03:17:10,880 --> 03:17:13,680
even if you got in for a quick scalp bam

5079
03:17:13,680 --> 03:17:15,760
look how fast that took you up

5080
03:17:15,760 --> 03:17:16,880
and this is what i'm talking about with

5081
03:17:16,880 --> 03:17:18,399
news i don't pay attention to news and

5082
03:17:18,399 --> 03:17:20,800
all that other stuff because it always

5083
03:17:20,800 --> 03:17:23,279
hits my area and then reacts off of the

5084
03:17:23,279 --> 03:17:24,399
news

5085
03:17:24,399 --> 03:17:26,640
so that's just something that that you

5086
03:17:26,640 --> 03:17:28,960
guys want to you know consider utilizing

5087
03:17:28,960 --> 03:17:30,800
and paying attention to and i want this

5088
03:17:30,800 --> 03:17:32,640
video to be the video that you guys go

5089
03:17:32,640 --> 03:17:34,479
back and watch like

5090
03:17:34,479 --> 03:17:36,399
go back and and and

5091
03:17:36,399 --> 03:17:37,439
you know

5092
03:17:37,439 --> 03:17:39,680
study and learn from from this

5093
03:17:39,680 --> 03:17:42,479
particular video there's so much

5094
03:17:42,479 --> 03:17:45,200
sauce that was given all in this short

5095
03:17:45,200 --> 03:17:48,399
period of time like so much and and i

5096
03:17:48,399 --> 03:17:50,800
know that if you guys utilize this like

5097
03:17:50,800 --> 03:17:54,880
you'll be able to to you know really

5098
03:17:54,880 --> 03:17:56,479
you know learn and and change your

5099
03:17:56,479 --> 03:17:58,080
circumstances so look i mentioned the

5100
03:17:58,080 --> 03:18:01,120
fractals guys i said with a fractal

5101
03:18:01,120 --> 03:18:03,279
sometimes you have it to where price

5102
03:18:03,279 --> 03:18:05,600
reacts off of the fractal the wick up

5103
03:18:05,600 --> 03:18:08,560
the wick down price reacts and then

5104
03:18:08,560 --> 03:18:11,520
takes you up so with this

5105
03:18:11,520 --> 03:18:14,160
you have this push down below

5106
03:18:14,160 --> 03:18:17,680
and it touches this fractal

5107
03:18:18,000 --> 03:18:20,080
cool it hits this fractal quick scalp up

5108
03:18:20,080 --> 03:18:23,200
what is this a 63 pip scalp within two

5109
03:18:23,200 --> 03:18:24,560
minutes

5110
03:18:24,560 --> 03:18:26,800
63 pips

5111
03:18:26,800 --> 03:18:29,520
just off of the touch of a fractal you

5112
03:18:29,520 --> 03:18:32,399
know like these these things

5113
03:18:32,399 --> 03:18:34,640
if if you guys get the

5114
03:18:34,640 --> 03:18:37,600
get the zones and understand them

5115
03:18:37,600 --> 03:18:39,600
because i'm literally just scalping or

5116
03:18:39,600 --> 03:18:41,680
creating trades from zones period that's

5117
03:18:41,680 --> 03:18:43,439
it this is what i also meant to mention

5118
03:18:43,439 --> 03:18:44,800
to you guys

5119
03:18:44,800 --> 03:18:46,960
remember candlestick structure we talk

5120
03:18:46,960 --> 03:18:49,120
about a lot on here candlestick

5121
03:18:49,120 --> 03:18:51,120
structure so

5122
03:18:51,120 --> 03:18:53,439
we make this high we come back make this

5123
03:18:53,439 --> 03:18:56,640
low we put in another high we run the

5124
03:18:56,640 --> 03:18:58,000
low

5125
03:18:58,000 --> 03:18:59,680
after we run the low what do we do tap

5126
03:18:59,680 --> 03:19:01,439
back into the area and now we're pushing

5127
03:19:01,439 --> 03:19:02,960
out of it

5128
03:19:02,960 --> 03:19:05,680
if you guys noticed this in real time

5129
03:19:05,680 --> 03:19:10,000
then you would have easily said okay

5130
03:19:10,000 --> 03:19:11,279
we

5131
03:19:11,279 --> 03:19:13,760
took out this high

5132
03:19:13,760 --> 03:19:14,960
and

5133
03:19:14,960 --> 03:19:17,840
we took out the low right after so price

5134
03:19:17,840 --> 03:19:20,560
is going to trade back into this area so

5135
03:19:20,560 --> 03:19:22,800
what do we get we get a trade back up

5136
03:19:22,800 --> 03:19:25,680
into the area too short from

5137
03:19:25,680 --> 03:19:27,680
where do we short from here stops behind

5138
03:19:27,680 --> 03:19:28,960
the zone

5139
03:19:28,960 --> 03:19:30,000
here

5140
03:19:30,000 --> 03:19:33,439
and we're looking to go to the next area

5141
03:19:33,439 --> 03:19:35,680
of interest and the next area of

5142
03:19:35,680 --> 03:19:38,479
interest is i mean we we still

5143
03:19:38,479 --> 03:19:40,720
what is this this oh did it did it touch

5144
03:19:40,720 --> 03:19:42,880
the fractal a second time so look we

5145
03:19:42,880 --> 03:19:44,800
touched the fractal let's say you you

5146
03:19:44,800 --> 03:19:46,319
took this directly to the fractal a

5147
03:19:46,319 --> 03:19:47,439
second time

5148
03:19:47,439 --> 03:19:49,600
it touched the fractal a second time

5149
03:19:49,600 --> 03:19:52,560
but what is it doing behind the area

5150
03:19:52,560 --> 03:19:54,319
that it touched

5151
03:19:54,319 --> 03:19:57,359
we're trading below the wick

5152
03:19:57,359 --> 03:19:58,399
and then

5153
03:19:58,399 --> 03:20:00,479
we push back up

5154
03:20:00,479 --> 03:20:02,399
within that area so this is what i talk

5155
03:20:02,399 --> 03:20:04,880
about with sometimes price returning a

5156
03:20:04,880 --> 03:20:07,359
second time to your area

5157
03:20:07,359 --> 03:20:09,840
but also having a bounce up off of the

5158
03:20:09,840 --> 03:20:12,239
area so we literally just

5159
03:20:12,239 --> 03:20:14,720
grabbed liquidity directly behind it and

5160
03:20:14,720 --> 03:20:17,680
then trade it back up again to this area

5161
03:20:17,680 --> 03:20:19,439
where are we trading to back up to this

5162
03:20:19,439 --> 03:20:22,560
area this possible s and d zone

5163
03:20:22,560 --> 03:20:25,439
right here

5164
03:20:26,960 --> 03:20:29,359
right here

5165
03:20:29,359 --> 03:20:32,160
that could be a target from this area

5166
03:20:32,160 --> 03:20:35,200
heading back up to and oftentimes we do

5167
03:20:35,200 --> 03:20:38,880
get a reaction from the s and d zones

5168
03:20:38,880 --> 03:20:40,880
even if it's a small reaction we still

5169
03:20:40,880 --> 03:20:42,880
get reactions you know so you get a

5170
03:20:42,880 --> 03:20:44,319
reaction here and then there's a

5171
03:20:44,319 --> 03:20:46,239
possible one that's that's right up

5172
03:20:46,239 --> 03:20:47,359
above

5173
03:20:47,359 --> 03:20:49,760
you know within here but

5174
03:20:49,760 --> 03:20:52,399
we know that that within here if price

5175
03:20:52,399 --> 03:20:55,920
trades up above this from this high to

5176
03:20:55,920 --> 03:20:59,439
possibly up into here it's already

5177
03:20:59,439 --> 03:21:01,120
mitigated

5178
03:21:01,120 --> 03:21:03,520
this is already mitigated between this

5179
03:21:03,520 --> 03:21:05,920
area this area in this area here very

5180
03:21:05,920 --> 03:21:08,960
small areas already mitigated

5181
03:21:08,960 --> 03:21:13,120
so look we we have this reaction

5182
03:21:13,120 --> 03:21:14,880
coming out of this area and we can be

5183
03:21:14,880 --> 03:21:17,120
coming down to this s and d that it left

5184
03:21:17,120 --> 03:21:19,359
here

5185
03:21:21,279 --> 03:21:23,279
it left an s and d here and this is a

5186
03:21:23,279 --> 03:21:25,120
pretty large s and d

5187
03:21:25,120 --> 03:21:27,680
but we can be coming down to tap this

5188
03:21:27,680 --> 03:21:29,600
and because we have not came through

5189
03:21:29,600 --> 03:21:31,040
this or

5190
03:21:31,040 --> 03:21:33,439
we have not came through the low of this

5191
03:21:33,439 --> 03:21:36,319
neither have we put in another high

5192
03:21:36,319 --> 03:21:40,319
after this zone sometimes it can bounce

5193
03:21:40,319 --> 03:21:43,520
from zone sorry

5194
03:21:43,520 --> 03:21:45,600
it can bounce from

5195
03:21:45,600 --> 03:21:47,040
what is

5196
03:21:47,040 --> 03:21:48,880
can you click it please

5197
03:21:48,880 --> 03:21:53,359
it can bounce from zone to zone two zone

5198
03:21:53,359 --> 03:21:54,560
two zone

5199
03:21:54,560 --> 03:21:58,239
two zone two zone two zone two zone it

5200
03:21:58,239 --> 03:22:00,880
could do that over and over and over and

5201
03:22:00,880 --> 03:22:02,160
over again

5202
03:22:02,160 --> 03:22:04,640
over and over and over again

5203
03:22:04,640 --> 03:22:10,080
until it invalidates one of these zones

5204
03:22:10,080 --> 03:22:11,920
until it invalidates one of them

5205
03:22:11,920 --> 03:22:14,479
it can do that over and over and over

5206
03:22:14,479 --> 03:22:16,560
and over and over again

5207
03:22:16,560 --> 03:22:18,960
and both of the both of the zones still

5208
03:22:18,960 --> 03:22:21,920
be valid because they have not

5209
03:22:21,920 --> 03:22:24,319
disrespected any of the rules that we

5210
03:22:24,319 --> 03:22:25,520
had

5211
03:22:25,520 --> 03:22:26,720
which was

5212
03:22:26,720 --> 03:22:29,680
that price either has to

5213
03:22:29,680 --> 03:22:30,800
break

5214
03:22:30,800 --> 03:22:32,800
through the zone

5215
03:22:32,800 --> 03:22:35,520
or it has to put in a new high it has to

5216
03:22:35,520 --> 03:22:37,840
break through this zone or it has to put

5217
03:22:37,840 --> 03:22:40,720
in a new low the new low is here

5218
03:22:40,720 --> 03:22:42,479
at the bottom of this zone which

5219
03:22:42,479 --> 03:22:44,319
invalidates this zone but the new low

5220
03:22:44,319 --> 03:22:46,800
also invalidates this zone

5221
03:22:46,800 --> 03:22:48,880
but it can go from zone to zone to zone

5222
03:22:48,880 --> 03:22:51,120
to zone to zone to zone to zone just

5223
03:22:51,120 --> 03:22:53,359
like that

5224
03:22:53,359 --> 03:22:54,800
just like that

5225
03:22:54,800 --> 03:22:58,239
and i teach this stuff every single day

5226
03:22:58,239 --> 03:23:00,800
every day i teach this stuff i don't

5227
03:23:00,800 --> 03:23:03,600
charge anybody money i don't like

5228
03:23:03,600 --> 03:23:06,399
nothing i don't i just want people to

5229
03:23:06,399 --> 03:23:08,560
change their life circumstances

5230
03:23:08,560 --> 03:23:11,600
i want people to to be able to

5231
03:23:11,600 --> 03:23:13,439
you know like do the things they want to

5232
03:23:13,439 --> 03:23:15,520
do do the things they love to do this is

5233
03:23:15,520 --> 03:23:18,239
a hard world things are getting worse

5234
03:23:18,239 --> 03:23:20,960
you know like prices are raising

5235
03:23:20,960 --> 03:23:22,800
not because of any

5236
03:23:22,800 --> 03:23:24,800
you know president or any political

5237
03:23:24,800 --> 03:23:27,200
party but because of

5238
03:23:27,200 --> 03:23:28,640
greed

5239
03:23:28,640 --> 03:23:30,479
they don't have to raise these prices

5240
03:23:30,479 --> 03:23:32,960
it's greed it's nothing but greed

5241
03:23:32,960 --> 03:23:34,720
this is not a result of anybody's

5242
03:23:34,720 --> 03:23:37,520
monetary policy it's global inflation

5243
03:23:37,520 --> 03:23:39,359
this is greed man

5244
03:23:39,359 --> 03:23:40,640
greed

5245
03:23:40,640 --> 03:23:43,520
so i just want like we we are as a

5246
03:23:43,520 --> 03:23:46,000
result we are hurt

5247
03:23:46,000 --> 03:23:47,040
by this

5248
03:23:47,040 --> 03:23:49,520
game of greed that they're playing

5249
03:23:49,520 --> 03:23:50,720
we are hurt

5250
03:23:50,720 --> 03:23:52,399
us people

5251
03:23:52,399 --> 03:23:54,399
but we want to be able to navigate those

5252
03:23:54,399 --> 03:23:55,920
things because we still have kids that

5253
03:23:55,920 --> 03:23:57,359
need to eat

5254
03:23:57,359 --> 03:23:58,960
we still have roofs that we have to put

5255
03:23:58,960 --> 03:24:01,120
over our head we still have daily things

5256
03:24:01,120 --> 03:24:02,479
we have to take care of some people

5257
03:24:02,479 --> 03:24:04,319
takes they take care of their loved ones

5258
03:24:04,319 --> 03:24:05,920
some people take care of their families

5259
03:24:05,920 --> 03:24:07,200
the parents

5260
03:24:07,200 --> 03:24:09,359
not even having kids some people still

5261
03:24:09,359 --> 03:24:11,279
are responsible for other people their

5262
03:24:11,279 --> 03:24:13,600
siblings whoever it is

5263
03:24:13,600 --> 03:24:15,840
and it's very very difficult it's very

5264
03:24:15,840 --> 03:24:18,319
hard for them

5265
03:24:18,319 --> 03:24:19,600
so

5266
03:24:19,600 --> 03:24:20,640
why

5267
03:24:20,640 --> 03:24:22,640
if somebody's trying to change their

5268
03:24:22,640 --> 03:24:24,720
financial circumstances why would i take

5269
03:24:24,720 --> 03:24:26,720
advantage of

5270
03:24:26,720 --> 03:24:29,359
like give them garbage trades why would

5271
03:24:29,359 --> 03:24:30,479
i do that

5272
03:24:30,479 --> 03:24:32,319
why would i come on here acting like i

5273
03:24:32,319 --> 03:24:34,160
know what i'm talking about and and i

5274
03:24:34,160 --> 03:24:35,600
don't

5275
03:24:35,600 --> 03:24:37,680
that's unacceptable

5276
03:24:37,680 --> 03:24:39,760
and i don't believe in that at all so

5277
03:24:39,760 --> 03:24:41,600
this is why i come out to do the things

5278
03:24:41,600 --> 03:24:44,000
that i do you know and i hope that that

5279
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:46,160
people gain some type of

5280
03:24:46,160 --> 03:24:48,319
you know some type of value from it i

5281
03:24:48,319 --> 03:24:51,120
hope that you guys actually

5282
03:24:51,120 --> 03:24:53,359
you know get something you guys actually

5283
03:24:53,359 --> 03:24:55,439
take something where you could notice in

5284
03:24:55,439 --> 03:24:57,760
the markets and be able to make you know

5285
03:24:57,760 --> 03:25:00,239
even if it's a cup of coffee man

5286
03:25:00,239 --> 03:25:02,880
like being able to make some money to

5287
03:25:02,880 --> 03:25:05,840
to even have a cup of coffee

5288
03:25:05,840 --> 03:25:08,399
you know like i i believe in that too

5289
03:25:08,399 --> 03:25:10,160
and that's why i do what i do it's not

5290
03:25:10,160 --> 03:25:11,840
because

5291
03:25:11,840 --> 03:25:14,319
you know i feel like you know people

5292
03:25:14,319 --> 03:25:16,880
deserve it or it's not because like you

5293
03:25:16,880 --> 03:25:20,160
know i want to go to the road of fame if

5294
03:25:20,160 --> 03:25:22,560
somebody was to take my techniques and

5295
03:25:22,560 --> 03:25:25,359
just like become a big power player in

5296
03:25:25,359 --> 03:25:28,319
the world with it they're cool whatever

5297
03:25:28,319 --> 03:25:31,279
you know like now you're changing more

5298
03:25:31,279 --> 03:25:32,720
people's lives

5299
03:25:32,720 --> 03:25:35,600
in a larger fashion you know like like

5300
03:25:35,600 --> 03:25:38,080
on a larger platform

5301
03:25:38,080 --> 03:25:40,080
now you're doing that

5302
03:25:40,080 --> 03:25:43,359
on a larger platform you're doing that

5303
03:25:43,359 --> 03:25:46,640
so if that's the only thing

5304
03:25:46,640 --> 03:25:48,080
that happens

5305
03:25:48,080 --> 03:25:50,640
with this type of teaching that's enough

5306
03:25:50,640 --> 03:25:51,840
for me

5307
03:25:51,840 --> 03:25:53,439
that's enough i don't need anybody's

5308
03:25:53,439 --> 03:25:54,399
money

5309
03:25:54,399 --> 03:25:56,239
i don't need the biggest house i don't

5310
03:25:56,239 --> 03:25:58,800
need a ferrari i can get those things if

5311
03:25:58,800 --> 03:26:00,720
i wanted to but i don't need that what

5312
03:26:00,720 --> 03:26:03,760
makes me happy what makes my heart full

5313
03:26:03,760 --> 03:26:04,720
is

5314
03:26:04,720 --> 03:26:06,720
people being able to change their lives

5315
03:26:06,720 --> 03:26:09,760
off of something that i was able to take

5316
03:26:09,760 --> 03:26:13,040
process teach them in a manner where

5317
03:26:13,040 --> 03:26:14,720
it could help them

5318
03:26:14,720 --> 03:26:16,239
to learn

5319
03:26:16,239 --> 03:26:18,319
something for the rest of that life this

5320
03:26:18,319 --> 03:26:19,680
is a skill that you could learn for the

5321
03:26:19,680 --> 03:26:21,040
rest of your life whether you want to

5322
03:26:21,040 --> 03:26:22,560
trade for prop firms whether you want to

5323
03:26:22,560 --> 03:26:23,680
trade for

5324
03:26:23,680 --> 03:26:26,000
um banks or organizations whether you

5325
03:26:26,000 --> 03:26:27,439
want to trade for yourself whether you

5326
03:26:27,439 --> 03:26:29,040
want to teach your kids trading whether

5327
03:26:29,040 --> 03:26:30,800
you want to teach your your families or

5328
03:26:30,800 --> 03:26:32,720
your churches or or other people that

5329
03:26:32,720 --> 03:26:34,319
you know whether you want to teach them

5330
03:26:34,319 --> 03:26:37,680
trading you can

5331
03:26:37,680 --> 03:26:38,800
you can

5332
03:26:38,800 --> 03:26:41,120
this is a skill

5333
03:26:41,120 --> 03:26:45,439
that you can teach others freedom with

5334
03:26:45,439 --> 03:26:49,200
and it can give you your freedom too

5335
03:26:50,000 --> 03:26:51,600
you know so so you see i said it could

5336
03:26:51,600 --> 03:26:53,200
bounce within these areas you can just

5337
03:26:53,200 --> 03:26:55,840
consolidate within this area yeah

5338
03:26:55,840 --> 03:26:57,920
very very possible

5339
03:26:57,920 --> 03:27:01,200
very let me go back and i think i had

5340
03:27:01,200 --> 03:27:02,720
this here yeah

5341
03:27:02,720 --> 03:27:04,000
yeah

5342
03:27:04,000 --> 03:27:06,160
very possible that it can bounce within

5343
03:27:06,160 --> 03:27:08,080
these areas

5344
03:27:08,080 --> 03:27:09,040
so

5345
03:27:09,040 --> 03:27:11,279
and it can create newer areas within

5346
03:27:11,279 --> 03:27:12,239
here

5347
03:27:12,239 --> 03:27:14,239
because look this wick right here was an

5348
03:27:14,239 --> 03:27:16,479
s and d that price came back up two

5349
03:27:16,479 --> 03:27:18,399
tapped into and got rejected from ram

5350
03:27:18,399 --> 03:27:20,560
the low

5351
03:27:20,560 --> 03:27:22,479
and then when it ran the low and came

5352
03:27:22,479 --> 03:27:25,200
back up it created this smd here and

5353
03:27:25,200 --> 03:27:27,040
then what the price do come down and tap

5354
03:27:27,040 --> 03:27:29,439
into it and go above

5355
03:27:29,439 --> 03:27:32,239
we went from this s and d here

5356
03:27:32,239 --> 03:27:33,600
pushed up

5357
03:27:33,600 --> 03:27:34,960
we opened up

5358
03:27:34,960 --> 03:27:37,760
came back to this s d here the newly one

5359
03:27:37,760 --> 03:27:39,600
that was created after it mitigated this

5360
03:27:39,600 --> 03:27:43,040
one and then we pulled up into the snd

5361
03:27:43,040 --> 03:27:44,080
above

5362
03:27:44,080 --> 03:27:46,560
then we tapped into the s and d above

5363
03:27:46,560 --> 03:27:48,960
and now we're pulling down we go below

5364
03:27:48,960 --> 03:27:50,479
this one and we could potentially

5365
03:27:50,479 --> 03:27:52,399
further go below this one because this

5366
03:27:52,399 --> 03:27:54,840
one already came into this

5367
03:27:54,840 --> 03:27:58,399
one so you just see it go from s and d

5368
03:27:58,399 --> 03:28:01,279
to s and d to s d to s and d to s and d

5369
03:28:01,279 --> 03:28:03,359
tests d over and over and over and over

5370
03:28:03,359 --> 03:28:04,720
and over again

5371
03:28:04,720 --> 03:28:07,840
like i hope you guys can see the

5372
03:28:07,840 --> 03:28:09,359
the richness

5373
03:28:09,359 --> 03:28:10,640
of like

5374
03:28:10,640 --> 03:28:13,920
what i'm saying in in real time like

5375
03:28:13,920 --> 03:28:16,560
principles and reasons as to why

5376
03:28:16,560 --> 03:28:18,000
this is happening

5377
03:28:18,000 --> 03:28:19,200
so you see i said it was going to run

5378
03:28:19,200 --> 03:28:20,720
this low why because we had already

5379
03:28:20,720 --> 03:28:22,319
mitigated this

5380
03:28:22,319 --> 03:28:24,479
but we tapped into this s and d above to

5381
03:28:24,479 --> 03:28:26,800
come down and run this low here and now

5382
03:28:26,800 --> 03:28:28,960
that we ran this lows another s and d in

5383
03:28:28,960 --> 03:28:30,319
here

5384
03:28:30,319 --> 03:28:32,160
and it could be in here or right above

5385
03:28:32,160 --> 03:28:34,399
this

5386
03:28:34,560 --> 03:28:36,239
you know but after running this low is

5387
03:28:36,239 --> 03:28:37,680
there a possibility that we could still

5388
03:28:37,680 --> 03:28:41,279
try to run the high yes there is

5389
03:28:41,279 --> 03:28:43,840
but could we continue short still yes

5390
03:28:43,840 --> 03:28:46,479
and you know who benefits from it most

5391
03:28:46,479 --> 03:28:48,239
the person that was in a short from up

5392
03:28:48,239 --> 03:28:50,560
here

5393
03:28:50,640 --> 03:28:52,640
they don't care about any of this stuff

5394
03:28:52,640 --> 03:28:54,880
going on down here i said when the highs

5395
03:28:54,880 --> 03:28:57,040
are usually ran when structural highs

5396
03:28:57,040 --> 03:28:58,319
are usually ran

5397
03:28:58,319 --> 03:28:59,680
oftentimes

5398
03:28:59,680 --> 03:29:03,680
you get a huge pull away

5399
03:29:03,680 --> 03:29:05,600
and we have that

5400
03:29:05,600 --> 03:29:08,319
with this structural high

5401
03:29:08,319 --> 03:29:10,960
we get the huge pull away

5402
03:29:10,960 --> 03:29:13,600
don't we don't get a body close above so

5403
03:29:13,600 --> 03:29:15,520
we know that we're still in murky

5404
03:29:15,520 --> 03:29:17,359
territories we're still in territories

5405
03:29:17,359 --> 03:29:18,840
of

5406
03:29:18,840 --> 03:29:20,640
shorting

5407
03:29:20,640 --> 03:29:23,200
you know and i'm talking about overall

5408
03:29:23,200 --> 03:29:25,279
i'm not just talking about like

5409
03:29:25,279 --> 03:29:26,160
like

5410
03:29:26,160 --> 03:29:28,640
where we are in price but overall

5411
03:29:28,640 --> 03:29:32,319
so look we get a break below this low

5412
03:29:32,319 --> 03:29:34,960
let me look on the ohlc before i

5413
03:29:34,960 --> 03:29:37,600
tell you guys that's a break so it's 0

5414
03:29:37,600 --> 03:29:40,080
30 and this is

5415
03:29:40,080 --> 03:29:43,760
0 30. so this is an equal low right here

5416
03:29:43,760 --> 03:29:47,399
within this area

5417
03:29:50,560 --> 03:29:53,120
change this color back to black this is

5418
03:29:53,120 --> 03:29:54,880
an equal low here

5419
03:29:54,880 --> 03:29:56,800
other times you get it equal low trade

5420
03:29:56,800 --> 03:29:57,840
away

5421
03:29:57,840 --> 03:29:59,920
whatever the objective is for price to

5422
03:29:59,920 --> 03:30:02,319
do it goes it goes and it does it and

5423
03:30:02,319 --> 03:30:05,600
then it runs it

5424
03:30:06,239 --> 03:30:08,319
so we have this equilo established we'll

5425
03:30:08,319 --> 03:30:10,399
see what price does there was a little s

5426
03:30:10,399 --> 03:30:12,880
d created here

5427
03:30:12,880 --> 03:30:15,279
price opened up tapped into it got

5428
03:30:15,279 --> 03:30:18,720
rejected from it took out this low

5429
03:30:18,720 --> 03:30:21,120
after it took out this low created an

5430
03:30:21,120 --> 03:30:23,920
equilo came back up tapped into the snd

5431
03:30:23,920 --> 03:30:25,680
created above here

5432
03:30:25,680 --> 03:30:30,720
then came down and ran both lows

5433
03:30:30,720 --> 03:30:33,520
yeah exactly exactly just like that you

5434
03:30:33,520 --> 03:30:35,120
know exactly

5435
03:30:35,120 --> 03:30:37,040
uh teachers dave

5436
03:30:37,040 --> 03:30:40,160
to call your callers

5437
03:30:40,319 --> 03:30:41,760
this is power

5438
03:30:41,760 --> 03:30:45,359
yes i want people to learn this like i

5439
03:30:45,359 --> 03:30:47,439
told you i could trade every movement of

5440
03:30:47,439 --> 03:30:50,399
price if i wanted to every single

5441
03:30:50,399 --> 03:30:53,040
movement of price i can trade if i

5442
03:30:53,040 --> 03:30:54,479
wanted to

5443
03:30:54,479 --> 03:30:57,680
because i've spent that much time

5444
03:30:57,680 --> 03:30:59,279
studying this so look there's a little

5445
03:30:59,279 --> 03:31:01,760
imbalance inside of here i don't know if

5446
03:31:01,760 --> 03:31:03,600
price will push up past the imbalance or

5447
03:31:03,600 --> 03:31:06,000
come down to the fractal that also has

5448
03:31:06,000 --> 03:31:08,080
the s and d inside of it

5449
03:31:08,080 --> 03:31:10,880
we'll see if it it has any

5450
03:31:10,880 --> 03:31:12,800
reaction off of it or if it just runs

5451
03:31:12,800 --> 03:31:14,880
through it it could very well do that

5452
03:31:14,880 --> 03:31:16,880
you know but you have this little snd

5453
03:31:16,880 --> 03:31:19,279
zone followed by this little fractal in

5454
03:31:19,279 --> 03:31:21,359
here also

5455
03:31:21,359 --> 03:31:23,359
so let's see if you chose

5456
03:31:23,359 --> 03:31:24,880
the fractal

5457
03:31:24,880 --> 03:31:26,640
that's here

5458
03:31:26,640 --> 03:31:29,439
if you chose

5459
03:31:29,439 --> 03:31:32,239
the s and d

5460
03:31:33,040 --> 03:31:35,040
that's

5461
03:31:35,040 --> 03:31:37,359
here

5462
03:31:39,680 --> 03:31:41,200
and then there's

5463
03:31:41,200 --> 03:31:42,319
this

5464
03:31:42,319 --> 03:31:44,960
smaller one above or below sorry down

5465
03:31:44,960 --> 03:31:47,200
here

5466
03:31:48,239 --> 03:31:50,880
followed by an imbalance right above it

5467
03:31:50,880 --> 03:31:53,359
imbalance right in here

5468
03:31:53,359 --> 03:31:55,359
yep see

5469
03:31:55,359 --> 03:31:58,640
tap within this area there was a gap up

5470
03:31:58,640 --> 03:32:00,080
here

5471
03:32:00,080 --> 03:32:02,720
um i don't know what that was about

5472
03:32:02,720 --> 03:32:04,720
but then further into the area here if

5473
03:32:04,720 --> 03:32:07,040
you're still in the short you're fine

5474
03:32:07,040 --> 03:32:08,800
it doesn't matter to you and not just

5475
03:32:08,800 --> 03:32:09,920
that

5476
03:32:09,920 --> 03:32:13,120
you have an equal high up here

5477
03:32:13,120 --> 03:32:14,720
so there's a possibility that this low

5478
03:32:14,720 --> 03:32:18,399
is ran because of this equal high

5479
03:32:18,399 --> 03:32:19,680
but that doesn't mean that there can't

5480
03:32:19,680 --> 03:32:23,840
be a reaction here first

5481
03:32:24,080 --> 03:32:26,080
and if there's a reaction here first it

5482
03:32:26,080 --> 03:32:28,160
could very well pop back up fill some of

5483
03:32:28,160 --> 03:32:30,640
this imbalance up here or it can come

5484
03:32:30,640 --> 03:32:33,200
back up into these areas to mitigate

5485
03:32:33,200 --> 03:32:34,239
before

5486
03:32:34,239 --> 03:32:36,560
going short

5487
03:32:36,560 --> 03:32:39,359
but these are things that that

5488
03:32:39,359 --> 03:32:40,880
you know you guys should just pay

5489
03:32:40,880 --> 03:32:43,359
attention to in in real time and even

5490
03:32:43,359 --> 03:32:45,600
try to look for it on your own

5491
03:32:45,600 --> 03:32:47,520
look at the reactions of these and try

5492
03:32:47,520 --> 03:32:51,359
to create a trading style around

5493
03:32:51,359 --> 03:32:54,399
doing this around these reactions

5494
03:32:54,399 --> 03:32:56,800
try to create a trading style and that

5495
03:32:56,800 --> 03:32:59,760
trading style will it will help you like

5496
03:32:59,760 --> 03:33:03,359
exceptionally it will shift your trading

5497
03:33:03,359 --> 03:33:06,160
to to another place i'm going to take it

5498
03:33:06,160 --> 03:33:08,000
to another place

5499
03:33:08,000 --> 03:33:09,359
you know so

5500
03:33:09,359 --> 03:33:13,120
this could potentially be distribution

5501
03:33:13,120 --> 03:33:15,520
for white golf

5502
03:33:15,520 --> 03:33:17,279
up here this could potentially be

5503
03:33:17,279 --> 03:33:19,200
distribution

5504
03:33:19,200 --> 03:33:20,720
um up here

5505
03:33:20,720 --> 03:33:22,560
so if if this

5506
03:33:22,560 --> 03:33:25,040
indeed is um

5507
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:27,200
distribution then

5508
03:33:27,200 --> 03:33:29,760
you know this is coming down

5509
03:33:29,760 --> 03:33:34,560
um and where could it go um

5510
03:33:34,960 --> 03:33:38,880
maybe into this area here

5511
03:33:38,880 --> 03:33:42,160
could get a reaction out of this area

5512
03:33:42,160 --> 03:33:44,560
also as it would have just ran the low

5513
03:33:44,560 --> 03:33:48,080
as well um

5514
03:33:48,880 --> 03:33:50,720
let's see

5515
03:33:50,720 --> 03:33:53,520
you could get a minor reaction within

5516
03:33:53,520 --> 03:33:56,319
this area possibly

5517
03:33:56,319 --> 03:33:57,840
i'm thinking

5518
03:33:57,840 --> 03:33:59,279
trying to give you some give you guys

5519
03:33:59,279 --> 03:34:03,120
some areas before i head out of here

5520
03:34:03,840 --> 03:34:06,479
maybe even

5521
03:34:06,479 --> 03:34:08,800
somewhere around this area

5522
03:34:08,800 --> 03:34:11,439
possibly

5523
03:34:11,600 --> 03:34:13,359
and if we run

5524
03:34:13,359 --> 03:34:15,520
this low

5525
03:34:15,520 --> 03:34:16,960
down here

5526
03:34:16,960 --> 03:34:18,880
there's still

5527
03:34:18,880 --> 03:34:21,840
um this area here remember these these

5528
03:34:21,840 --> 03:34:24,080
are just targets if if you're shorting

5529
03:34:24,080 --> 03:34:27,200
you want to look at um

5530
03:34:27,200 --> 03:34:29,600
you know just what the reaction of price

5531
03:34:29,600 --> 03:34:30,399
is

5532
03:34:30,399 --> 03:34:32,399
if it comes to this area with this

5533
03:34:32,399 --> 03:34:34,640
protected low it could potentially give

5534
03:34:34,640 --> 03:34:37,279
you a reaction here

5535
03:34:37,279 --> 03:34:39,120
and that's the last area of reaction

5536
03:34:39,120 --> 03:34:40,319
before

5537
03:34:40,319 --> 03:34:42,399
it takes you down into some of these

5538
03:34:42,399 --> 03:34:43,680
areas

5539
03:34:43,680 --> 03:34:45,120
down here

5540
03:34:45,120 --> 03:34:47,120
some of these areas i mean i think it

5541
03:34:47,120 --> 03:34:50,080
could further mitigate within the 700s

5542
03:34:50,080 --> 03:34:52,640
um that could be a possibility i don't

5543
03:34:52,640 --> 03:34:54,000
know if it would get down here by the

5544
03:34:54,000 --> 03:34:56,160
end of the day we have two hours so

5545
03:34:56,160 --> 03:34:57,279
there's still

5546
03:34:57,279 --> 03:34:59,760
quite some movement that price can make

5547
03:34:59,760 --> 03:35:01,840
um but price could end up coming down to

5548
03:35:01,840 --> 03:35:04,560
this area and then by the time all of

5549
03:35:04,560 --> 03:35:06,160
that like huge

5550
03:35:06,160 --> 03:35:08,239
volume comes in it ends up just

5551
03:35:08,239 --> 03:35:10,479
springing it up to like

5552
03:35:10,479 --> 03:35:12,800
somewhere up into here like that's a

5553
03:35:12,800 --> 03:35:14,880
possibility just the same way there was

5554
03:35:14,880 --> 03:35:17,279
this this spring here

5555
03:35:17,279 --> 03:35:18,560
right here

5556
03:35:18,560 --> 03:35:20,080
same way you had this huge push-up let

5557
03:35:20,080 --> 03:35:21,840
me actually see if um

5558
03:35:21,840 --> 03:35:24,479
there was any news that happened

5559
03:35:24,479 --> 03:35:26,720
um

5560
03:35:28,080 --> 03:35:30,640
let me see

5561
03:35:33,920 --> 03:35:37,439
let me uh double check

5562
03:35:37,439 --> 03:35:40,960
um so i follow um this guy named uh

5563
03:35:40,960 --> 03:35:44,000
delta one i say it in most of my streams

5564
03:35:44,000 --> 03:35:44,800
um

5565
03:35:44,800 --> 03:35:47,040
he has most of

5566
03:35:47,040 --> 03:35:47,920
um

5567
03:35:47,920 --> 03:35:51,279
the news live like as it's happening um

5568
03:35:51,279 --> 03:35:53,040
he's releasing it i think he's on the

5569
03:35:53,040 --> 03:35:54,800
president's plane

5570
03:35:54,800 --> 03:35:57,920
um wow oil went five dollars again is

5571
03:35:57,920 --> 03:36:00,160
oil and gold going up so usually when

5572
03:36:00,160 --> 03:36:02,399
oil and gold is going up like that's a

5573
03:36:02,399 --> 03:36:03,840
bias that i have for something

5574
03:36:03,840 --> 03:36:06,399
potentially happening with the war

5575
03:36:06,399 --> 03:36:08,800
if gold is pushing up by itself then

5576
03:36:08,800 --> 03:36:10,720
there's something happening with within

5577
03:36:10,720 --> 03:36:14,080
our economy the u.s economy if oil is

5578
03:36:14,080 --> 03:36:15,760
pushing up then there's something

5579
03:36:15,760 --> 03:36:17,760
happening as it relates to the energy

5580
03:36:17,760 --> 03:36:19,680
crisis that we're in but it still

5581
03:36:19,680 --> 03:36:21,920
somewhat goes back to

5582
03:36:21,920 --> 03:36:24,800
you know like things with possible war

5583
03:36:24,800 --> 03:36:25,840
so um

5584
03:36:25,840 --> 03:36:28,319
i use those different things together to

5585
03:36:28,319 --> 03:36:30,560
try and give me a bias where i don't

5586
03:36:30,560 --> 03:36:32,160
have to look at the news i kind of have

5587
03:36:32,160 --> 03:36:34,399
an idea of like what could be happening

5588
03:36:34,399 --> 03:36:37,200
in the fundamental arena just based on

5589
03:36:37,200 --> 03:36:40,800
what the technicals show for those

5590
03:36:44,080 --> 03:36:47,279
um investigating crypto

5591
03:36:47,279 --> 03:36:48,479
um

5592
03:36:48,479 --> 03:36:49,680
some company

5593
03:36:49,680 --> 03:36:53,439
froze withdrawals on krypto

5594
03:36:58,319 --> 03:37:03,000
illama still talking about twitter

5595
03:37:09,359 --> 03:37:13,040
looks like the sec is just suing

5596
03:37:13,040 --> 03:37:14,640
well looks like it's investigating the

5597
03:37:14,640 --> 03:37:16,319
company

5598
03:37:16,319 --> 03:37:18,080
yes it is there's not much news that

5599
03:37:18,080 --> 03:37:20,000
little spike could have just been you

5600
03:37:20,000 --> 03:37:23,120
know some sort of manipulation

5601
03:37:23,120 --> 03:37:25,840
um which which tends to happen because

5602
03:37:25,840 --> 03:37:27,600
you see how it had that huge push up

5603
03:37:27,600 --> 03:37:29,200
took out the high

5604
03:37:29,200 --> 03:37:32,239
and then trade it below it

5605
03:37:32,239 --> 03:37:34,160
so oftentimes the those are

5606
03:37:34,160 --> 03:37:35,760
manipulations but this is what i was

5607
03:37:35,760 --> 03:37:37,200
saying i was saying that if you learn

5608
03:37:37,200 --> 03:37:39,600
technical analysis a lot of the times

5609
03:37:39,600 --> 03:37:41,600
you could learn to stay out of those

5610
03:37:41,600 --> 03:37:43,920
manipulations because look look at how

5611
03:37:43,920 --> 03:37:46,640
this pushed up huge

5612
03:37:46,640 --> 03:37:49,439
after touching our line

5613
03:37:49,439 --> 03:37:51,040
now imagine if we jumped in and tried to

5614
03:37:51,040 --> 03:37:53,600
short from here

5615
03:37:53,600 --> 03:37:56,000
he got railed

5616
03:37:56,000 --> 03:37:57,680
you know so

5617
03:37:57,680 --> 03:37:59,520
so that's something that that you guys

5618
03:37:59,520 --> 03:38:02,640
just like want to pay attention to

5619
03:38:02,640 --> 03:38:04,560
um and you see what i said you see what

5620
03:38:04,560 --> 03:38:06,560
i mentioned in here

5621
03:38:06,560 --> 03:38:09,120
like let's say that you took this area

5622
03:38:09,120 --> 03:38:10,720
for a bye

5623
03:38:10,720 --> 03:38:12,640
because it came down to this fractal

5624
03:38:12,640 --> 03:38:14,800
let's say you went in for a buy

5625
03:38:14,800 --> 03:38:16,880
brought you in you know quite a bit dr

5626
03:38:16,880 --> 03:38:18,880
quite a bit of drawdown but look it

5627
03:38:18,880 --> 03:38:21,600
brought you right back to break even

5628
03:38:21,600 --> 03:38:23,359
and gave you what like two pips maybe

5629
03:38:23,359 --> 03:38:25,040
for the commission

5630
03:38:25,040 --> 03:38:27,680
but even if you got it wrong

5631
03:38:27,680 --> 03:38:29,199
there's still a possibility for some

5632
03:38:29,199 --> 03:38:31,600
sort of redemption before

5633
03:38:31,600 --> 03:38:33,840
being able to take it in whatever next

5634
03:38:33,840 --> 03:38:36,319
direction it could possibly be going to

5635
03:38:36,319 --> 03:38:38,319
so this is oh look this is the bounce

5636
03:38:38,319 --> 03:38:39,760
that i have met

5637
03:38:39,760 --> 03:38:41,199
i didn't even notice that you see i just

5638
03:38:41,199 --> 03:38:42,720
be chatting and don't don't even

5639
03:38:42,720 --> 03:38:45,199
recognize the stuff that

5640
03:38:45,199 --> 03:38:46,640
so look i said it would come down to

5641
03:38:46,640 --> 03:38:49,600
this area and have a bounce up um this

5642
03:38:49,600 --> 03:38:52,399
was 43 pips that it pushed up wow that's

5643
03:38:52,399 --> 03:38:55,760
nice so yeah um you know uh

5644
03:38:55,760 --> 03:38:58,080
i'm gonna say again uh if if you guys

5645
03:38:58,080 --> 03:39:00,239
liked what you saw you guys appreciated

5646
03:39:00,239 --> 03:39:02,399
what you saw learn learn something today

5647
03:39:02,399 --> 03:39:04,160
please go ahead and like the video

5648
03:39:04,160 --> 03:39:06,800
subscribe if you're new um we do this

5649
03:39:06,800 --> 03:39:09,680
every day and and and potentially we

5650
03:39:09,680 --> 03:39:11,199
could be doing this all day when that

5651
03:39:11,199 --> 03:39:13,600
discord is up and running but we we do

5652
03:39:13,600 --> 03:39:15,279
this all the time

5653
03:39:15,279 --> 03:39:17,040
you know like and let me let me actually

5654
03:39:17,040 --> 03:39:20,160
show you guys another thing actually um

5655
03:39:20,160 --> 03:39:23,040
right before i i even you know segway

5656
03:39:23,040 --> 03:39:25,199
into that look at this

5657
03:39:25,199 --> 03:39:26,800
you see what i'm talking about in terms

5658
03:39:26,800 --> 03:39:28,640
of let's say the inverse head and

5659
03:39:28,640 --> 03:39:32,000
shoulders patterns that i say so look

5660
03:39:32,000 --> 03:39:34,000
the neckline break they would they would

5661
03:39:34,000 --> 03:39:35,920
say like they they always say that it's

5662
03:39:35,920 --> 03:39:37,680
not always um

5663
03:39:37,680 --> 03:39:39,040
you know like

5664
03:39:39,040 --> 03:39:39,840
uh

5665
03:39:39,840 --> 03:39:41,520
it's not always

5666
03:39:41,520 --> 03:39:43,279
correct like in terms of parallel

5667
03:39:43,279 --> 03:39:45,840
they're not always next to each other um

5668
03:39:45,840 --> 03:39:47,680
like creating equal highs or anything

5669
03:39:47,680 --> 03:39:50,080
like that but you know they would say

5670
03:39:50,080 --> 03:39:50,960
this

5671
03:39:50,960 --> 03:39:53,040
the shoulder pull back here and they

5672
03:39:53,040 --> 03:39:55,520
would say you can get in here or here at

5673
03:39:55,520 --> 03:39:57,439
the neckline break

5674
03:39:57,439 --> 03:39:59,600
and they tell you to do that let's say

5675
03:39:59,600 --> 03:40:01,840
let's say you did get in on an order

5676
03:40:01,840 --> 03:40:03,040
here

5677
03:40:03,040 --> 03:40:04,479
at the neckline break

5678
03:40:04,479 --> 03:40:06,080
let's say you chose this neckline break

5679
03:40:06,080 --> 03:40:09,279
you chose to to buy up into this

5680
03:40:09,279 --> 03:40:11,279
from here

5681
03:40:11,279 --> 03:40:13,359
i don't know why that's still doing that

5682
03:40:13,359 --> 03:40:15,120
but

5683
03:40:15,120 --> 03:40:17,680
let's say you choose to buy here at the

5684
03:40:17,680 --> 03:40:20,160
neckline break

5685
03:40:20,160 --> 03:40:21,760
you choose to buy to tell you to place

5686
03:40:21,760 --> 03:40:23,439
your stops

5687
03:40:23,439 --> 03:40:24,560
behind

5688
03:40:24,560 --> 03:40:26,239
the arm here first of all look at that

5689
03:40:26,239 --> 03:40:29,359
outrageous stop loss never ever like

5690
03:40:29,359 --> 03:40:32,000
ever will ever be a stop loss for me

5691
03:40:32,000 --> 03:40:33,040
ever

5692
03:40:33,040 --> 03:40:35,600
ever

5693
03:40:35,600 --> 03:40:37,920
but they tell you to to go for the area

5694
03:40:37,920 --> 03:40:39,600
in which it came from

5695
03:40:39,600 --> 03:40:42,239
which is more like right here

5696
03:40:42,239 --> 03:40:44,080
absence of structure

5697
03:40:44,080 --> 03:40:45,520
you don't know what the hell is

5698
03:40:45,520 --> 03:40:47,520
happening here

5699
03:40:47,520 --> 03:40:49,840
and you should not be taking a trade

5700
03:40:49,840 --> 03:40:53,040
that's like this at all

5701
03:40:53,040 --> 03:40:55,680
like at all because

5702
03:40:55,680 --> 03:40:57,520
you just saw the pattern but you don't

5703
03:40:57,520 --> 03:40:59,600
know what the hell is even happening

5704
03:40:59,600 --> 03:41:02,239
here even from a higher time frame even

5705
03:41:02,239 --> 03:41:04,880
if you went to a higher time frame

5706
03:41:04,880 --> 03:41:06,479
you can't just see this pattern and be

5707
03:41:06,479 --> 03:41:07,920
like oh yeah that's an inverse heading

5708
03:41:07,920 --> 03:41:09,359
shows from a higher time frame yeah let

5709
03:41:09,359 --> 03:41:12,479
me jump in and trade this no

5710
03:41:12,479 --> 03:41:15,120
because your neckline break was here

5711
03:41:15,120 --> 03:41:18,800
your stops was behind the shoulder here

5712
03:41:18,800 --> 03:41:20,800
that's what they usually teach this is a

5713
03:41:20,800 --> 03:41:24,560
192 pip stop loss how disgusting and

5714
03:41:24,560 --> 03:41:26,720
then what they tell you target target a

5715
03:41:26,720 --> 03:41:29,680
one to one

5716
03:41:29,680 --> 03:41:31,760
that is disgusting i don't know why

5717
03:41:31,760 --> 03:41:33,760
people get on the internet and teach

5718
03:41:33,760 --> 03:41:35,199
things like this

5719
03:41:35,199 --> 03:41:37,600
because there's no

5720
03:41:37,600 --> 03:41:40,000
sorry let me stop ranting guys so so

5721
03:41:40,000 --> 03:41:41,760
yeah this is this is what i'm saying

5722
03:41:41,760 --> 03:41:43,920
absence of structure or absent of

5723
03:41:43,920 --> 03:41:44,960
structure

5724
03:41:44,960 --> 03:41:46,560
this is not something that that you want

5725
03:41:46,560 --> 03:41:48,960
to use like even if this did come up

5726
03:41:48,960 --> 03:41:49,920
above

5727
03:41:49,920 --> 03:41:52,080
um this high here you see we put in a

5728
03:41:52,080 --> 03:41:53,040
high

5729
03:41:53,040 --> 03:41:55,040
we put in a low

5730
03:41:55,040 --> 03:41:56,960
and then we broke the high

5731
03:41:56,960 --> 03:41:58,640
over here with this

5732
03:41:58,640 --> 03:42:00,399
this could potentially still come down

5733
03:42:00,399 --> 03:42:01,359
into

5734
03:42:01,359 --> 03:42:05,040
this area here but this would only

5735
03:42:05,040 --> 03:42:07,840
do that based on

5736
03:42:07,840 --> 03:42:08,800
here

5737
03:42:08,800 --> 03:42:10,960
so we have this high

5738
03:42:10,960 --> 03:42:12,560
we have this low

5739
03:42:12,560 --> 03:42:15,040
we have a run of the high here

5740
03:42:15,040 --> 03:42:17,439
now we potentially come back into either

5741
03:42:17,439 --> 03:42:21,199
this area or even this area

5742
03:42:21,199 --> 03:42:22,720
to potentially

5743
03:42:22,720 --> 03:42:26,239
go long if we are going long from any of

5744
03:42:26,239 --> 03:42:28,239
these areas

5745
03:42:28,239 --> 03:42:30,560
but the inverse head and shoulders if

5746
03:42:30,560 --> 03:42:32,239
your stops was behind the shoulder they

5747
03:42:32,239 --> 03:42:34,800
would have easily taken you out

5748
03:42:34,800 --> 03:42:38,399
at 190 something pep stop loss

5749
03:42:38,399 --> 03:42:42,239
because it's absent of actual structure

5750
03:42:42,239 --> 03:42:44,479
but i'm gonna go down my kid reminding

5751
03:42:44,479 --> 03:42:46,560

5752
