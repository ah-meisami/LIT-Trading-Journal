into this area um

41
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:32,799
this is a fractal here followed by an

42
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:35,360
imbalance in between here

43
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:36,959
good morning i just want to say about

44
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:38,560

45
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,360
teachings i made 200 on my

46
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,680

00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,080
more stories like that like that's why i

51
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:58,080
teach as open and in public as i do

52
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,760
hey hey little boy be quiet

53
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,599
he always gets loud when he hears me

54
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,159

55
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,560
but um yeah i'm happy to hear that

56
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,040
that's that's great man i i want people

57
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,680
to pass their challenges you know make

58
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:15,760
money consistently

59
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,160
just with the little bit of things that

60
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:20,079
we learn here today

61
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:22,320
you know like every day i come into the

62
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,479
market and want to make sure that it's a

63
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:26,560
killer day for somebody or it's some

64
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:28,960
information that somebody can take home

65
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,919
and

66
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:31,199
you know like

67
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,040
do something different when they're not

68
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,840
on the charts with me or you know it's i

69
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:37,440
just want everybody to learn this i feel

70
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:38,720
like um

71
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:40,560
i only took four months to learn this it

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:42,880
was really really easy for me i think

73
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,040
it's just the way that um

74
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:47,680
my brain processes things

75
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:50,960
and it just was really easy for me so um

76
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:52,240
you know i'm out here trying to crack

77
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,560
the code for others whenever i was

78
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,800
learning and um i was teaching some of

79
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,840
my friends the interesting part was if

80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,320
they couldn't understand something

81
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,639
i would go and learn whatever it is that

82
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:07,440
they were learning just to find an

83
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:10,160
easier way for them to understand what

84
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:12,160
they were learning and this is even

85
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:13,919
while i was learning something entirely

86
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:15,039
different

87
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:17,280
so all the concepts that i have all the

88
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:19,039
stuff that i teach here

89
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:20,320
it was just

90
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,280
taking things and making it easier

91
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:25,840
hey hey

92
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,240
people don't like crying babies on the

93
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:34,880
airplane

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:36,880
i doubt people want to hear babies

95
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,320
acting up while you're trading

96
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,600
we're gonna do the top down soon i came

97
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,440
what's up how's everything what's up man

98
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:47,520

this this is why i mean we're making a

104
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:00,080
discord we're working on it i'm gonna

105
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:02,160
stop putting pressure on on the media

106
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:04,560
guy um but

107
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:07,039
you know with with the um

108
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,560
with the discord i wish that um

109
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,800
you know like when we have it i'm going

110
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,440
to be putting a lot of these things in

111
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,919
it so you guys can see

112
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:18,840
like

113
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,400
exactly you know what's happening um

114
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,280
this morning i was um i was talking to

115
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:26,639
someone

116
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:27,520
and

117
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,120
i had sent this to them

118
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,360
uh actually no it wasn't this morning

119
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,080
this was last night

120
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:38,960
i sent this to them i said pay attention

121
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,960
to these levels

122
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:42,560
you know i had one right here where

123
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,120
price had already hit so that was ruled

124
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:45,919
out

125
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,639
the next important level i had was 873

126
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:53,120
and i said price can come down here tap

127
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,199
into this area and

128
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:56,319
push up

129
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,639
you know give us another high so price

130
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,280
actually kept trading higher and higher

131
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,599
you know from from this point um it

132
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:05,120
actually did not

133
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,840
come down to this area um it actually

134
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,400
started to go up um but if you look at

135
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,080
it this morning

136
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,360
this is where i tell you guys to pay

137
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,039
attention to areas and keep them for

138
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:16,560
later on

139
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,000
this morning

140
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,319
look at this 873

141
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,400
price comes down

142
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,400
taps right into it and this is market

143
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,440
open the 930 candle

144
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:29,919
if you had this level already it would

145
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:31,919
have been so easy just to be like oh

146
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,479
that hit the exact level to get in

147
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,400
and bam

148
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:38,479
you'd have been up like this to the next

149
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:40,400
area up here

150
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:42,080
because all of this is mitigated going

151
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,599
up

152
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:45,120
maybe a little imbalance here that you

153
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,039
might find some resistance at yeah there

154
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,120
was a little bit there

155
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,280
but then straight up to the areas up

156
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,960
here so from here to here just like that

157
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,840
and not just that

158
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,960
um i was talking to somebody this

159
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:00,160
morning i told them there was a

160
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:02,680
rejection up here at

161
00:08:02,680 --> 00:08:04,639
30195.

162
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:05,919
um

163
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:08,639
actually i have it here yeah

164
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,080
look i said

165
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,919
i said we're gonna get a rejection of

166
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,240
the imbalance at 30195

167
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,840
and

168
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:20,160
then you know we'll have a shift down

169
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:23,360
and i said we may stop here but we also

170
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:25,840
could stop here and i said depending on

171
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:27,520
what happens here

172
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,759
we can get rejected from

173
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,919
this area here

174
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:34,719
and possibly run the low

175
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,240
and

176
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,159
you know if you look at it we got

177
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,679
rejected from this area here

178
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,760
and then we ran the lows all the way to

179
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:48,399
this area

180
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:49,200
so

181
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,120
from

182
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,839
30195 to

183
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:57,600
29873 back up to the same area

184
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,279
and all of that you you see that this

185
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:01,040
stuff is there with the timestamps and

186
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,120
everything you know like

187
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,800
this is why the discord is going to be

188
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:07,040
so powerful because

189
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,560
these are things that i'm just like

190
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,640
randomly thinking you know oh it's a

191
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,560
possibility that that could happen and

192
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,760
then like

193
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,839
boom look look

194
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:16,959
that's

195
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:19,440
that's insane i mean

196
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,760
i when i was a part of like other groups

197
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:23,680
they weren't doing things like this you

198
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:25,800
know like

199
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,320
forecasting and and

200
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,000
you know like there was none of that it

201
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,200
was just like all right we're gonna

202
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:33,200
enter trade here you know

203
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,399
and it's like

204
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:36,399
all right 12 pips should be good clothes

205
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:38,480
right here you know and it's like

206
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:40,080
clearly you didn't know what they were

207
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,240
doing but i mean you look at this this

208
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:44,839
is from this morning you know um

209
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,920
321 pips down

210
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,200
and then

211
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,720
300 pips back up

212
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:56,240
and that would have been in one hour

213
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:58,720
i literally told her

214
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,399
watch the rejection

215
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:04,320
of the imbalance at 30195

216
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,880
rejected from there and kept falling

217
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:08,720
yeah you had a little push up but i said

218
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,640
it could tap that area and continue it

219
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:12,880
did

220
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:13,839
and

221
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,399
you know we just kept going

222
00:10:16,399 --> 00:10:18,160
you know there was this little area that

223
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,320
i had right here to the left a little

224
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,880
tiny area that i was saying price can

225
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,920
you know

226
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:26,640
get a little uh scalp off of look it tap

227
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
the area

228
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,360
look at this

229
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,560
tap the s and d here

230
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,360
pushed up tapped into the imbalance and

231
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,240
then left 71 pips just off of a little

232
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,640
tiny area that that you notice to the

233
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,519
back and you go from target to target as

234
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:48,880
i always say

235
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,800
you know so

236
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,160
these

237
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:55,200
it's it's rare in the market

238
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:56,560
that

239
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:58,959
these these areas

240
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:01,760
you know don't account for anything

241
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,640
these areas are very very important

242
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,680
areas

243
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:08,480
they do account for things so

244
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,240
you know that's just what some people

245
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:12,399
have to understand like if there's a

246
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,279
rejection somewhere there's a reason why

247
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:17,519
whether it's on this time frame or the

248
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,680
the two minute or eight minute or the

249
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:21,920
hourly or whatever it is

250
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,760
there's definitely

251
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:26,320
a reason why and if you find out the

252
00:11:26,320 --> 00:11:28,880
reason why that rejection happened

253
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:32,320
then you begin to search more and more

254
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:35,120
for the different reasons why rejections

255
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,040
happen

256
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,480
all throughout the chart and now the

257
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:41,440
chart begins to tell you a story

258
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,959
you know it tells you

259
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:45,200
that it's going from s and d to

260
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:47,279
imbalance from imbalance to imbalance

261
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:50,000
from s d to s d and that's the only way

262
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,839
that price moves

263
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:54,160
price only moves

264
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,360
to s ds and imbalances that's it

265
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,959
nothing else yeah we get the run of

266
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:01,680
certain highs as you know manipulation

267
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,600
at times and then you have a huge push

268
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,680
down or runner below huge push up yeah

269
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:07,600
we get those

270
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,279
but it seems as though the the algorithm

271
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:13,600
runs to

272
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,600
you know um imbalances and smds alone

273
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,000
so you know with with supply and demand

274
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:20,959
trading

275
00:12:20,959 --> 00:12:23,200
that's one half of it that's a very

276
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:25,200
powerful way to trade

277
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,920
the other is to incorporate sorry and

278
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:29,839
incorporate um

279
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,360
you know

280
00:12:31,360 --> 00:12:32,959
uh the imbalances

281
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:34,800
and once you incorporate the imbalances

282
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,839
in it now you have like

283
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,560
a versatile way of trading

284
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,240
because you're understanding and balance

285
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:44,880
reactions you're understanding

286
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:47,120
reactions from s and d's

287
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,760
and coupling those two together

288
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,680
with how price moves where price goes to

289
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:54,720
you know

290
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,279
that is it would change your trading

291
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,279
style forever so you don't even have to

292
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:00,880
do like the little candlestick thing

293
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:03,279
that i look for in there or you know

294
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,600
like the bullish flip or like you don't

295
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,360
have to do any of that if you don't want

296
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:08,320
to

297
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,480
just learn order flow learn learn the

298
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:12,880
way price moves

299
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:14,800
and then just watch for

300
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:19,079
you know rejections in those areas

301
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:22,079
dave are you going to travel this

302
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:23,839

you know you're the best dad ever and

315
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,399
and these are just like they spend a lot

316
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,320
of time with me you would think that the

317
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:58,560
parent they were the most is the parent

318
00:13:58,560 --> 00:13:59,519
they

319
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,440
you know have such

320
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,639
anger towards but i mean

321
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:06,399
they they just really enjoy themselves

322
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:08,160
and and i'm grateful for that you know

323
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:09,839
so when i hear little things like oh

324
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:11,600
you're the best dad ever

325
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:14,320
you know it's like yeah i know you know

326
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,720
because i try to be you know and and i

327
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:18,160
try to make every day

328
00:14:18,160 --> 00:14:20,399
you know father's day you know or every

329
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:22,800
day thanksgiving or everything christmas

330
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,720
you know like

331
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:26,240
we don't get caught up in the the

332
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,079
holiday things i mean if people do

333
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:30,000
that's fine we'll celebrate with others

334
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,560
that's okay um but

335
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:35,199
you know other than that like

336
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:36,560
you know every day's father's day

337
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,800
father's day for me it's just

338
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:41,360
pretty sucky that that he's sick so this

339
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:44,399
could be coming down to this area here

340
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,839
let's uh see what it's going to do

341
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:50,800
to there

342
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:53,519
yeah let's see what it does here

343
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:55,600
sorry wait where did i put this

344
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,279
i'm tripping i'm so sorry guys

345
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:01,440
the last low

346
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,959
the last

347
00:15:02,959 --> 00:15:04,800
candle

348
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,320
down

349
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,639
if it's large enough

350
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:13,160
it should send it that way

351
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:16,320
because if you look if you look at this

352
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
um

353
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,959
this here was already mitigated

354
00:15:20,959 --> 00:15:23,360
look at this

355
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,720
let's take it to this high here

356
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,320
you see how this tucked above

357
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:32,959
like that tucked above that high

358
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:36,880
and then it dipped back into the area

359
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:40,240
tapped into the center of this area and

360
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:42,480
then traded out of it

361
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:44,800
so this was already mitigated so it's a

362
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,800
possibility that this continues down

363
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:01,920
uh

364
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,360
hey dave good morning what's up sean

365
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,639
how's everything good morning good

366
00:16:04,639 --> 00:16:06,959
morning

367
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:09,120
my um uh

368
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,759
media guy uh he suggested that i change

369
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
the camera angle because he was saying

370
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,279
that uh

371
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:18,000
the other one looked a bit weird i don't

372
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,000
i don't think so you know like

373
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,519
i kind of like the one a little better i

374
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:26,240
had like my my sexy side on it and now

375
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:28,639
i gotta look like i'm cross-eyed over

376
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:30,639
here

377
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:32,160
so yeah i hope you guys are fine with

378
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,959
the uh the angle change on that

379
00:16:34,959 --> 00:16:37,600
um so this

380
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,240
filled this imbalance here

381
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:42,800
let's check and see if it does anything

382
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,199
here

383
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:50,240
because it may just be an imbalance fill

384
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,120
to

385
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,600
continue sometimes that can happen but

386
00:16:53,600 --> 00:16:56,240
this candlestick pattern

387
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,160
you know let's see let's see if it runs

388
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:00,639
this high

389
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:05,039
because there's an area down here that i

390
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:07,280
could still tap

391
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,280
into before continuing up

392
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:14,880
i didn't do the uh

393
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:17,839
the top down yet guys um and wait a

394
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:20,319
couple more minutes

395
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,119
um

396
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:22,880
just so people don't miss it those top

397
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:25,599
down to everything man oh my gosh like

398
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,039
that

399
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:28,880
they really give you some some great

400
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,840
direction for the day

401
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:35,120
um i think yesterday

402
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:38,400
what did i

403
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:40,960
what did i say yesterday there was some

404
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,440
levels that i gave i just don't remember

405
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,200
what they were

406
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:48,000
um oh it was on the other chart why am i

407
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:50,559
on this one

408
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,799
oh that's my personal chart that's why

409
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,120
yeah yesterday here we go

410
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,799
look at this

411
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:08,960
this was from the top down this exact

412
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,919
area

413
00:18:09,919 --> 00:18:12,400
you see the top on this

414
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,880
from six seven we marked out a couple of

415
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,200
these areas where we can get some

416
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,440
you know reactions from but a possible

417
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:22,080
reversal to head back up

418
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,400
and if you look we got one right here

419
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,240
right on this line

420
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,240
at 767. i don't think i don't remember

421
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,559
if this was from the hourly or or the 15

422
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,000
minute it might have been the 15 minute

423
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,919
not too short no no it might have been

424
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,280
the hourly um but yeah look at this

425
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:40,000
perfect tap on the line drawdown where

426
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,640
and and look at

427
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,160
look at the height that it goes

428
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,080
look at that

429
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,039
474 pips

430
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,520
just from the touch of this area

431
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,200
this is what i was saying about these

432
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,080
how strong these areas are from the

433
00:18:58,080 --> 00:19:00,400
higher time frames and when you get

434
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,960
touches to those areas there might be

435
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,360
like a little dip below it

436
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,400
but then there's like a huge push coming

437
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:10,080
out of that area and then i also

438
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,679
mentioned um

439
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:16,160
on stream another thing i said that um

440
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:19,440
i said that price was probably going to

441
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:23,360
dip back into here to run the lows

442
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:25,520
and i said that it would have to come

443
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,400
above i think it was two nine eight nine

444
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,320
eight i had mentioned on stream you guys

445
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,320
can go back to receipts of that

446
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:34,960
but it was two two nine eight nine eight

447
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,559
i was saying that if it broke that area

448
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:40,480
then you know that price is flipping

449
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,440
bullish

450
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,880
and that's after it dips in here if it

451
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:47,520
dips below this and then comes up to

452
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:50,160
break this area here

453
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,520
the ar

454
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,280
this is this is where white golf comes

455
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:54,160
in

456
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,760
because this this whole thing is

457
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:58,400
wyckoff's accumulation

458
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,559
and then it pushed up after wyckoff

459
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:02,799
teaches you what happens in

460
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,480
consolidation

461
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:08,640
so i'm a firm firm believer in in white

462
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,039
golf i mean look it

463
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:12,880
usually you know gives us this

464
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:14,880
accumulation and it usually brings us

465
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:16,320
back up

466
00:20:16,320 --> 00:20:19,039
to the high in which it came from and if

467
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:20,640
you look to the left

468
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,400
we hit that

469
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:23,520
bam

470
00:20:23,520 --> 00:20:25,919
and then reject it from there too so

471
00:20:25,919 --> 00:20:28,799
imagine finding the cell i mean the by

472
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:30,559
up to the cell

473
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:32,880
you know just paying attention to these

474
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,960
little things and i'm seeing this stuff

475
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,520
mind you from the one minute time frame

476
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:40,159
but as i said time is fractal time

477
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:42,720
frames do not matter you could see the

478
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:44,880
higher time frames on whatever time

479
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:46,640
frame you're on i could be on the

480
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,039
seconds chart and still see the higher

481
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,159
time frame

482
00:20:50,159 --> 00:20:52,559
you know once you expose yourself to

483
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,400
charting in that way like it doesn't

484
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:55,840
matter what time frame you're on you're

485
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,400
still seeing all of the same things

486
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,720
you know so this this essentially here

487
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:03,919
is wyckoff and i think um john had

488
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:05,679
mentioned it um

489
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:07,120
when when it first came down he said

490
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,720
looks like wyckoff is happening he

491
00:21:08,720 --> 00:21:10,240
actually started learning white golf

492
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:11,919
with me um

493
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,960
you know but there's usually the i said

494
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,320
if we dip below this low over here we

495
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,320
could tap into one of these areas and if

496
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,200
we push up and break

497
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:26,000
the 898 level

498
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,280
then we're gonna flip bullish

499
00:21:29,280 --> 00:21:31,840
so we pushed up we broke it this is the

500
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,520
spring in wyckoff this is the retest of

501
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:36,960
the spring

502
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:40,720
so we had where the spring was tapping

503
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,679
and then we also had the retest of it

504
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:45,280
too

505
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:48,640
so we had both of these areas

506
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:51,600
that we could use

507
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:52,880
and

508
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,640
and the reason why i say both is because

509
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:56,880
look this is an imbalance in here

510
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,640
price came and tapped into the imbalance

511
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,159
and left

512
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:02,159
not even the the supply or i mean not

513
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:04,559
even a demand zone below not even an s d

514
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:06,320
below

515
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:08,240
probably tapped on the top of it maybe

516
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,159
yeah the top of it

517
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:11,600
but if you were waiting for it to come

518
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:15,600
to the 50 of it it left without you

519
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:17,440
you had a

520
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,039
imbalance here

521
00:22:19,039 --> 00:22:21,200
with an s and d zone

522
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,520
right below it

523
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:27,120
which makes this whole area a likely

524
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,440
target

525
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:32,080
so we flipped up usually after the

526
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,600
spring

527
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:36,400
you usually break the ar

528
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,760
right here

529
00:22:37,760 --> 00:22:39,039
and if you guys go

530
00:22:39,039 --> 00:22:40,640
if learning if you guys aren't familiar

531
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:42,159
with white golf and you go and learn it

532
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:45,280
you you'd understand what i'm saying but

533
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,039
the ar

534
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:51,360
usually after the spring is made

535
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:53,360
this is the spring

536
00:22:53,360 --> 00:22:56,480
down into here we dip below a previous

537
00:22:56,480 --> 00:22:58,320
low

538
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,200
after the spring is made we usually have

539
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,679
a push up like that

540
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:06,799
and that breaks the

541
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:09,360
ar to the left

542
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:12,880
so we came back in to test

543
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:15,039
within the area

544
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:18,240
and then we were out of here

545
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,200
so there's an entry here

546
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,200
there was an entry here

547
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:27,360
there were other entries along the way

548
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,400
you know dipping back into imbalances or

549
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,320
you know dipping back into certain s and

550
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:35,440
d zones you know all the way up all of

551
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:38,880
this going up all the way up

552
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,279
unmitigated areas that price is coming

553
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:43,760
back to touch into

554
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,520
and once it taps into those areas you

555
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:48,240
see these three candles here these like

556
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:50,640
three down movements this one this one

557
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:52,960
and this one you see that stab in the

558
00:23:52,960 --> 00:23:54,559
middle

559
00:23:54,559 --> 00:23:57,039
you see how it's always present

560
00:23:57,039 --> 00:23:59,679
well not always but most times this has

561
00:23:59,679 --> 00:24:01,520
a stab in the middle

562
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:02,720
this

563
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:04,640
stab in the middle

564
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,159
this

565
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:08,320
stab in the middle

566
00:24:08,320 --> 00:24:11,520
like if you if you pay attention to

567
00:24:11,520 --> 00:24:13,840
to price and the way these things move

568
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,320
like this here

569
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:18,480
stab in the middle or on a larger scale

570
00:24:18,480 --> 00:24:21,120
since this is wike off this whole thing

571
00:24:21,120 --> 00:24:22,720
is wipe off

572
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:26,720
wykoff ends with a stab down and then

573
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:28,960
starts to make its way up and just like

574
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:30,960
it ends with a stab down is the same way

575
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,520
that it ends with a stab up

576
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:35,520
and that's why people tend to think they

577
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:36,240
see

578
00:24:36,240 --> 00:24:38,400
you know or not think they see they they

579
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:41,200
call it inverse head and shoulders

580
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,679
you know or head and shoulders pattern

581
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:45,600
when they're not understanding that it's

582
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,919
wipe off happening in there

583
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:51,520
so they see the youtad created

584
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:54,080
and then price comes down and gives you

585
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,440
that

586
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,279
you know um

587
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:59,120
that uh what was the show of weakness or

588
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:01,120
sign of weakness

589
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:04,080
and then it pushes back up to test the

590
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,799
utad

591
00:25:06,960 --> 00:25:08,400
but

592
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:10,559
they're not seeing that they're seeing

593
00:25:10,559 --> 00:25:12,480
that

594
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:14,880
sorry they're seeing that it pushes back

595
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,240
up

596
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:18,720
and for them they believe like i think

597
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,320
this is this is how i explained it

598
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,520
yesterday

599
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:23,520
look at this they see this as a inverse

600
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:26,080
head and shoulders

601
00:25:26,080 --> 00:25:27,120
sorry

602
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:29,039
here

603
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,400
here

604
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,000
here

605
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:33,360
here

606
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:34,960
here

607
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,640
and then they get in at the neckline

608
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:37,840
break here

609
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,360
but what happened with this neckline

610
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:40,480
break

611
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,120
tapped you in and then took you out

612
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:45,120
immediately

613
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,559
you see that

614
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,240
you got tapped in at the neckline break

615
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:50,080
whether you chose this as the neckline

616
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:52,159
break or whether you chose this as the

617
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:53,919
neckline break

618
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,000
you would have got tapped in and then

619
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,320
taken out immediately

620
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:00,480
with the spring

621
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,240
and that's why i tell people all the

622
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:03,120
time

623
00:26:03,120 --> 00:26:06,080
do not i mean i get that that it might

624
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:07,840
be easier for you in the beginning to

625
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,640
learn these things but do not trade

626
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:11,679
these

627
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,640
if they're absent of structure do not

628
00:26:14,640 --> 00:26:17,520
trade them just because you see them i

629
00:26:17,520 --> 00:26:20,559
told you it's it's almost like a

630
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:22,640
like a 30 percent

631
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:25,039
you know win rate on those

632
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,720
there's no way

633
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:28,720
so if you look

634
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:31,600
now if you look here

635
00:26:31,919 --> 00:26:34,000
sorry

636
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,600
if you look here here's another one

637
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:39,840
down

638
00:26:41,039 --> 00:26:43,279
into this

639
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:45,760
back up

640
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:49,200
up into this

641
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,400
and then we come down into this area

642
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:55,039
here but look we come back up you get

643
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:57,200
tapped into you thinking this is a

644
00:26:57,200 --> 00:27:00,080
neckline or maybe this is a neckline and

645
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:02,480
then what happens we get pulled back

646
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:03,600
below

647
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:05,360
the shoulder that they tell you to place

648
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:08,400
your stop loss behind

649
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:11,039
so price takes you out

650
00:27:11,039 --> 00:27:12,799
and then rips up in the direction that

651
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,720
you expected it to go into

652
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:17,360
why because you traded this absent of

653
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,200
structure

654
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:21,840
so i continue to you know try to talk to

655
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:24,000
people about these these retail patterns

656
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,919
because yes it's easy to see i see it

657
00:27:25,919 --> 00:27:27,120
all the time

658
00:27:27,120 --> 00:27:29,600
but do not use it while it's absence of

659
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,720
structure

660
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:33,200
because if it's absent of structure

661
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,520
that's like a 30 percent

662
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,799
win rate

663
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:38,399
30

664
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:42,159
win rate really really does matter the

665
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:44,320
30 win rate

666
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,880
rr matters too of course

667
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:48,720
you know but

668
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:51,039
like if you get your win rate up

669
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:53,520
your rr moves with it

670
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,200
andrew what's up how's everything good

671
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:57,440
seeing you man glad to have you let me

672
00:27:57,440 --> 00:27:59,200
finish you just remind me to drink my

673
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:01,279
coffee because you get me

674
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:04,640
going you get me talking

675
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,080
let me see what was the other chart that

676
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,399
we had

677
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,600
so it didn't hit the imbalance

678
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:16,960
here

679
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:19,360
there's another small imbalance within

680
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:20,820
here

681
00:28:20,820 --> 00:28:24,080
[Music]

682
00:28:24,080 --> 00:28:26,159
so the imbalance above here as well as

683
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,919
an imbalance here

684
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:31,279
but we're coming down to so we're within

685
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:33,760
this area we could be coming to this

686
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:34,240
area

687
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:36,960
[Music]

688
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,679
again here

689
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,240
let me just take this whole area

690
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:50,320
there's also a minor imbalance within

691
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:51,520
here

692
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:53,840
right on this line so let's see how

693
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,120
price

694
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,279
uh reacts to it

695
00:28:57,279 --> 00:28:58,799
i'm thinking if it's an imbalance i

696
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:00,080
should use um

697
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,840
green lines

698
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,240
and if it's um

699
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,240
s and d zone i should use a different

700
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:08,640
color

701
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:12,559
look at this pattern now let's see if we

702
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:16,320
get a flip above here

703
00:29:17,919 --> 00:29:20,399
let me see so see we hit this fractal

704
00:29:20,399 --> 00:29:22,320
got rejected

705
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,919
actually let me let me actually do the

706
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,799
top down um for you guys uh

707
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:31,200
let me not get beside myself

708
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:32,880
because i could just read probably

709
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,720
straight up like just on the chat let me

710
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,240
all right

711
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,120
oh let me go to the other chart

712
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:42,880
yeah so this is a chart that we do our

713
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:45,840
top downs on

714
00:29:46,159 --> 00:29:47,919
sometimes i don't be wanting to erase

715
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:50,799
certain things

716
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,799
because all of the

717
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,000
important information on it

718
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,120
so

719
00:29:57,120 --> 00:29:58,720
let's see

720
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,480
uh

721
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:03,520
let's delete this

722
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:05,039
now you ready you guys already know

723
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:07,039
where i'm going to start or hopefully

724
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:10,080
you guys do we always start at just as

725
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,720
akeem said

726
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:16,399
the open high low close of the candle

727
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:18,799
the previous day candle

728
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:20,480
so look at this

729
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,600
this was pushing down

730
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,679
when the candle opened up there was an

731
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:28,480
imbalance that was left between

732
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:31,760
this area here and up here

733
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:34,840
so price went back up to tag the

734
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:37,360
imbalance so

735
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:39,679
that's why i had a i believe the other

736
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:41,760
day you guys saw me place a green line

737
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,039
on the left side of the previous candle

738
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:48,399
and to the right side i extended it so

739
00:30:48,399 --> 00:30:50,240
you could see that when it fails the

740
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,039
imbalance oftentimes it just continues

741
00:30:53,039 --> 00:30:55,039
to sell off

742
00:30:55,039 --> 00:30:57,279
so these are things to like these these

743
00:30:57,279 --> 00:30:58,880
little things

744
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
like things to do when you're doing your

745
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:01,919
little um

746
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:03,200
not your little but when you're doing

747
00:31:03,200 --> 00:31:05,760
your top downs um

748
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:07,760
you know just consider that

749
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:10,399
um consider these imbalance fills that

750
00:31:10,399 --> 00:31:13,519
that price often does

751
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:15,440
let me see the price tap this imbalance

752
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,440
here

753
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,120
nope

754
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:23,039
so this is an area that price could

755
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:25,760
still have a fake pump up to

756
00:31:25,760 --> 00:31:28,720
tap and then reject so we think mark is

757
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:30,640
going bullish tapped into this area and

758
00:31:30,640 --> 00:31:32,640
then just could titties down

759
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,840
or if if this is flipping bullish and

760
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,080
tap into this area dip back into this

761
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:40,159
area and then go up

762
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,519
so we're going for this low here

763
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:45,039
i know some of you guys are like stop

764
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:47,679
talking and do the top down

765
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:49,760
slim what's up look at you reminding me

766
00:31:49,760 --> 00:31:51,919
that i'm forgetting my coffee you see

767
00:31:51,919 --> 00:31:55,919
andrew you see what slim does to me

768
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:59,120
so yeah this this is coming down to here

769
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:01,200
it should run this low

770
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:02,320
um

771
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,000
often times when we get the run of the

772
00:32:04,000 --> 00:32:06,559
low we get a huge spike up

773
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:09,919
um after so just be mindful of that

774
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:11,679
let me just look for some other areas

775
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:15,039
that's here so if it runs that low

776
00:32:15,039 --> 00:32:17,360
there's a possibility that it runs this

777
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:19,919
load too

778
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:27,200
are you guys fine with this music it

779
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,679
just you flip to something entirely

780
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,840
different i'm fine with it i just want

781
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,440
to make sure that you guys like

782
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:40,559
so yeah we have these two oh i have 653

783
00:32:40,559 --> 00:32:42,480
on the other chart too so that's good

784
00:32:42,480 --> 00:32:45,760
consistency you see you guys consistency

785
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:47,760
i'm not giving you one strategy today

786
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:50,799
and another tomorrow

787
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,640
so it's friday um friday could

788
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,240
definitely

789
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:58,480
you know like give us a push down here

790
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,640
because friday's usually like the

791
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:03,519
sell-off day um so we can definitely do

792
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,200
that armani what's up good morning good

793
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,480
morning

794
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,399
uh he's shannon what's up how's

795
00:33:08,399 --> 00:33:09,440
everything

796
00:33:09,440 --> 00:33:11,120
morning morning

797
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:13,200
he works for the caffeine industry and

798
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,880
he wants you to become addicted watch

799
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,480
out

800
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,159
yes i know please don't make me an

801
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:20,080
espresso i feel like i'm

802
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,880
having a overdose or something like that

803
00:33:22,880 --> 00:33:25,200
please don't i'm trying to kick the

804
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,679
habit of coffee too really really trying

805
00:33:27,679 --> 00:33:29,760
to kick the habit badly but

806
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:32,080
it's difficult look look see

807
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:34,559
so we run we run the low

808
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,240
there was like a little pump up that it

809
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,399
started to make just now when i saw it

810
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:39,519
but now it looks like it's a

811
00:33:39,519 --> 00:33:41,760
continuation i'm saying that this is the

812
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:43,360
next area that we could potentially

813
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:47,120
target but let me look to the left

814
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,519
to see oh we don't have anything here

815
00:33:49,519 --> 00:33:50,640
jeez

816
00:33:50,640 --> 00:33:51,679
yikes

817
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:53,840
yeah so i think i think we're we're

818
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:55,840
running we might be running down to that

819
00:33:55,840 --> 00:33:57,279
low let me

820
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,000
let me just double check um

821
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:02,159
more of this area

822
00:34:02,159 --> 00:34:03,039
uh

823
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:07,640
let's see the one hour

824
00:34:08,239 --> 00:34:10,079
um

825
00:34:10,079 --> 00:34:13,359
where's price currently at 724 oh yeah

826
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:15,199
no no i think we're running this low

827
00:34:15,199 --> 00:34:17,280
guys yeah so

828
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:18,800
yeah i think that's that's where we're

829
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,639
headed

830
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:23,199
let me just look behind it then

831
00:34:23,199 --> 00:34:24,960
because there could be something back

832
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:27,280
here

833
00:34:27,599 --> 00:34:29,040
that

834
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:31,359
um

835
00:34:32,320 --> 00:34:35,800
let me see

836
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:45,440
let me see if it hit this area already

837
00:34:45,760 --> 00:34:48,079
oh yeah it did right here yep took it

838
00:34:48,079 --> 00:34:50,000
out

839
00:34:50,000 --> 00:34:52,399
i'm telling you these areas are so bomb

840
00:34:52,399 --> 00:34:54,079
like

841
00:34:54,079 --> 00:34:55,839
geez

842
00:34:55,839 --> 00:34:57,760
so it could have a little tiny bounce

843
00:34:57,760 --> 00:34:58,960
here

844
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:03,520
um since this wasn't entirely mitigated

845
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:06,240
and it could have a touch

846
00:35:06,240 --> 00:35:07,119
uh

847
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:09,520
here

848
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:11,680
by the way guys i'm not wearing the same

849
00:35:11,680 --> 00:35:13,839
shirt i have a bunch of champion shirts

850
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:17,839
so need to get that out there

851
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,079
good morning good morning derek how's

852
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:22,800
everything good morning

853
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:25,040
so look these these two areas are where

854
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:28,480
price can possibly top and you know give

855
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:31,280
some movement up or or just continue

856
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,960
down um

857
00:35:32,960 --> 00:35:35,520
that's after it ends up running the low

858
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,359
of this so it has this this area between

859
00:35:39,359 --> 00:35:40,320
here

860
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:44,079
from six five three to six two one

861
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:46,400
and then ultimately we can capture the

862
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,640
low as well right here

863
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:57,520
all right let's go back and look at

864
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:01,040
where price is

865
00:36:02,079 --> 00:36:03,520
so look

866
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:05,359
we got that tap

867
00:36:05,359 --> 00:36:07,920
on the run of our low

868
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,800
we came further down into it

869
00:36:10,800 --> 00:36:12,640
and now we have

870
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:14,320
you know slight of

871
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:17,040
a slight push back up um i told you

872
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,359
after every structural low is ran you

873
00:36:19,359 --> 00:36:22,560
usually get like a a huge tuck back up

874
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,880
in that direction i don't know why i

875
00:36:24,880 --> 00:36:26,720
don't know what the reason is but this

876
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:28,800
could actually be signs of like a

877
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,800
reversal right now happening on a lower

878
00:36:30,800 --> 00:36:32,000
time frame

879
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,040
right here

880
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:35,280
because you had price come and go below

881
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:36,000
it

882
00:36:36,000 --> 00:36:39,440
and then price trade it back up into it

883
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,079
and then price trade it lower

884
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:44,640
so after price trades lower and then it

885
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:47,359
goes up and it runs like i know that's

886
00:36:47,359 --> 00:36:50,400
ugly right there but it it runs the high

887
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:53,599
then you have a dip back into the area

888
00:36:53,599 --> 00:36:54,640
and then

889
00:36:54,640 --> 00:36:57,119
it leaves like that and this is a very

890
00:36:57,119 --> 00:36:59,440
ugly drawing i'm not an artist at all so

891
00:36:59,440 --> 00:37:02,160
you just listen to the explanation i

892
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,400
know it might hurt your eyes

893
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,599
so

894
00:37:05,599 --> 00:37:07,440
so we tap into this

895
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,240
um there's nothing i mean this this is a

896
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:11,839
strange place

897
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:13,520
you know oh sorry

898
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,680
this is a strange place where where

899
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,680
prices now because

900
00:37:17,680 --> 00:37:19,200
um

901
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
you know we haven't been down to these

902
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,800
levels since um

903
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,880
the whole gamestop run

904
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:27,200
um you guys remember that right

905
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,880
we haven't been to these levels since

906
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,400
then let me see if i can go back a

907
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,320
little further

908
00:37:32,320 --> 00:37:35,359
and meet an area back here

909
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:37,280
sometimes with the replay tool it might

910
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:40,079
get you past some of the data that that

911
00:37:40,079 --> 00:37:42,640
you don't see when you scroll back you

912
00:37:42,640 --> 00:37:45,920
can do it at least two times i think

913
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,160
um

914
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,839
all right yes so we're here

915
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:56,079
oh look i'm looking for right here oh

916
00:37:56,079 --> 00:37:57,760
geez i already did it twice let me see

917
00:37:57,760 --> 00:38:00,960
if i can do it another time

918
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:03,520
ah there we go yes yes

919
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,839
so the replay tool can get you further

920
00:38:05,839 --> 00:38:08,480
back than just like the data that you

921
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,240
have it's just that if you flip to a

922
00:38:10,240 --> 00:38:12,240
different time frame right now like a

923
00:38:12,240 --> 00:38:14,000
lower time frame is going to take it all

924
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,119
away

925
00:38:15,119 --> 00:38:17,200
so it's best to um

926
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:19,200
use it like that

927
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:21,920
the the replay tool

928
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,640
let's see so we put in

929
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:29,160
we put in this low here

930
00:38:32,720 --> 00:38:34,400
and then

931
00:38:34,400 --> 00:38:37,040
we have

932
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:40,560
this too

933
00:38:40,560 --> 00:38:42,960
so let's see now we have these areas

934
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:45,960
here

935
00:38:46,960 --> 00:38:49,200
and these are areas to the left where we

936
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:51,119
could potentially

937
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:52,800
i mean i know this looks striped up and

938
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:54,720
crazy um

939
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:57,920
but there's a method to my madness uh so

940
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,839
i'll go back and and show you guys

941
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,320
so where are we

942
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,920
all right so we're still rummaging

943
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:10,240
around that area let me go on this time

944
00:39:10,240 --> 00:39:13,280
frame okay this is one minute

945
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,240
all right so you see how i said um

946
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,240
that we could have

947
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:20,720
um that dip below

948
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:22,560
and then that push up

949
00:39:22,560 --> 00:39:25,119
and then the dip back into the area like

950
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:26,480
the little drawing that i was doing

951
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:28,400
that's exactly what happened

952
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,160
um based on what i was seeing from the

953
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:32,079
the higher time frame and this is what i

954
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:34,720
say you know with the higher time frame

955
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:36,320
you guys can see the higher and lower

956
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:38,720
time frame across every time frame

957
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:40,320
they're all doing the same thing at the

958
00:39:40,320 --> 00:39:42,880
same time it's just being able to spot

959
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,200
that so look there's this little s and d

960
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:46,960
here it could just come crashing through

961
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:48,800
it you know

962
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:50,960
because this is still pretty early so

963
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,320
they could still be engaging in

964
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:55,119
sell-offs and guys i realized um

965
00:39:55,119 --> 00:39:57,200
something super neat

966
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,400
um

967
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:00,320
you know just an observation don't quote

968
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:01,520
me on it

969
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,400
but

970
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:04,319
i realized that

971
00:40:04,319 --> 00:40:06,480
spreads are higher

972
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:09,440
when hedge funds are selling off

973
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:11,280
so usually if you're trading a

974
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,040
particular pair

975
00:40:13,040 --> 00:40:14,319
and

976
00:40:14,319 --> 00:40:16,640
you're you're getting higher than usual

977
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,680
spreads

978
00:40:17,680 --> 00:40:20,640
often times it seems as though

979
00:40:20,640 --> 00:40:22,960
those are the times when hedge funds are

980
00:40:22,960 --> 00:40:25,920
um you know in the market and and

981
00:40:25,920 --> 00:40:28,720
creating a lot of activity so um that's

982
00:40:28,720 --> 00:40:30,000
just something

983
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,160
neat to to understand

984
00:40:32,160 --> 00:40:33,839
um you know whenever you're trading i'm

985
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:35,520
not saying every time you see it you

986
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:37,839
know like jump in the cell or whatever

987
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:39,280
it is but

988
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:41,520
you know it seems like um

989
00:40:41,520 --> 00:40:43,200
most of the activity that's happening

990
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:45,839
with hedge funds and corporations um

991
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:47,599
when they're usually selling on buying

992
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,359
in droves the spreads get a little bit

993
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:51,440
higher hey what's up what's up erin

994
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,359
what's up what's up how's everything

995
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:55,280
good seeing you back man happy to see

996
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:56,560
you

997
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:58,319
so you see how we tapped into this smd

998
00:40:58,319 --> 00:41:00,240
right here guys

999
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,000
i told you that we could have like on

1000
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,520
my little ugly drawing that i had

1001
00:41:05,520 --> 00:41:08,160
mentioned i said we dip below the area

1002
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,079
we come back up

1003
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,119
and then

1004
00:41:11,119 --> 00:41:13,440
we come back into the area and it would

1005
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:16,240
probably run maybe a high somewhere

1006
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,800
within here but we come back into the

1007
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,680
area and then we push out of it do we

1008
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,079
push out of it back to the s and d here

1009
00:41:24,079 --> 00:41:26,800
maybe but we could also push up above to

1010
00:41:26,800 --> 00:41:28,480
some of these areas that don't have

1011
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:32,240
mitigation like this one this one here

1012
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,119
uh

1013
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:36,319
this tapped into this area but not as

1014
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,400
much so it can be like another thing

1015
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,079
here that you know you might get a

1016
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:42,400
slight rejection from and even possibly

1017
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,760
here

1018
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:45,599
so this area this area this area this

1019
00:41:45,599 --> 00:41:47,520
here you could possibly get a rejection

1020
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:50,319
but these rejections are what forms the

1021
00:41:50,319 --> 00:41:51,599
trend

1022
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,359
so when you see

1023
00:41:53,359 --> 00:41:56,079
price going up and then it starts to

1024
00:41:56,079 --> 00:41:57,520
retrace

1025
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:00,480
we're looking at the areas that are

1026
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:02,960
starting the retracements

1027
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,960
so we're trading from

1028
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,520
beginning of the retracement to the end

1029
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:08,560
of it

1030
00:42:08,560 --> 00:42:10,720
and then from the end of that all the

1031
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:12,800
way to the continuation

1032
00:42:12,800 --> 00:42:14,960
that's what all of this movement is it's

1033
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,920
just creating the trend so everything

1034
00:42:17,920 --> 00:42:19,200
that it hits

1035
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:21,920
every area that we mark out that it hits

1036
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,400
it's hitting that area to tuck back and

1037
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:26,079
create the lower low

1038
00:42:26,079 --> 00:42:28,400
then we know that since it already got

1039
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:30,640
mitigated when price is coming back up

1040
00:42:30,640 --> 00:42:33,599
we know prices going through the area

1041
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:35,200
so that's something that that i want you

1042
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,560
guys to um

1043
00:42:36,560 --> 00:42:37,920
you know think about when we're trading

1044
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,040
like super powerful information um

1045
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,400
a lot of times people don't know when

1046
00:42:42,400 --> 00:42:44,000
it's going to pull back they don't know

1047
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:46,480
why it's pulling back they just throwing

1048
00:42:46,480 --> 00:42:48,160
their fib up and hoping that it comes to

1049
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:51,520
the 61.8 and it's absent of like actual

1050
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:54,160
rules so that's a little um gem for you

1051
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:56,160
guys a little nugget there so this was

1052
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:58,720
already mitigated here

1053
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:01,119
i believe that this should push up above

1054
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,040
this high because

1055
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:04,240
when price

1056
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:07,040
looked like when price dipped below here

1057
00:43:07,040 --> 00:43:09,440
it came back up to mitigate the area and

1058
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:10,319
then

1059
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:11,680
left

1060
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:15,040
so let's see what it does here

1061
00:43:15,040 --> 00:43:16,720
uh maybe this can come back to this

1062
00:43:16,720 --> 00:43:19,359
fractal here or even this imbalance when

1063
00:43:19,359 --> 00:43:22,160
within here you can come and tap it and

1064
00:43:22,160 --> 00:43:23,920
then

1065
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:25,920
continue higher i mean and there's this

1066
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:28,319
little s and d right within here so we

1067
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:30,160
can break through that tap into this

1068
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:32,480
fractal or

1069
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,520
into

1070
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,480
this area down here

1071
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,480
and if you guys have any charts you want

1072
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:44,240
me to look at like anything you're in

1073
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,560
long term anything from the higher time

1074
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:47,839
frame

1075
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:49,359
any market

1076
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:52,880
you know if you can draw it on a rock

1077
00:43:52,880 --> 00:43:55,280
and send it by picture i could help you

1078
00:43:55,280 --> 00:43:57,920
trade it you know so just let me know

1079
00:43:57,920 --> 00:44:00,079
i don't mind um going back to oh i did

1080
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,079
have something in oil

1081
00:44:02,079 --> 00:44:03,599
i believe

1082
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,599
yeah look at this look at this this is

1083
00:44:05,599 --> 00:44:08,400
amazing look at this

1084
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,920
so

1085
00:44:09,920 --> 00:44:11,920
so i saw price pushing back up to this

1086
00:44:11,920 --> 00:44:13,119
area

1087
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:14,880
and i was like um

1088
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:17,520
i was saying to myself

1089
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:19,359
you know maybe we'll get a tap up into

1090
00:44:19,359 --> 00:44:22,240
this smd here

1091
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:24,560
and then if we get a tap away

1092
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,960
we could potentially come down

1093
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:28,960
to this s and d here because i told you

1094
00:44:28,960 --> 00:44:30,720
price moved from s and d to s and d and

1095
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:32,800
balance to imbalance or s d to imbalance

1096
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:34,960
and balance to s and d things like that

1097
00:44:34,960 --> 00:44:37,680
so i said okay there's another slight

1098
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:40,000
imbalance in here

1099
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:42,240
maybe price can move up to this one

1100
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:43,760
because there's an imbalance here but

1101
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,440
then there's also an imbalance directly

1102
00:44:45,440 --> 00:44:46,800
behind it too

1103
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:49,280
so price made an imbalance in both you

1104
00:44:49,280 --> 00:44:52,480
know both places you know of of price so

1105
00:44:52,480 --> 00:44:54,640
it tapped up into this and i said maybe

1106
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,800
we get a rejection here and probably

1107
00:44:56,800 --> 00:44:59,440
find a rejection out of the area

1108
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:01,280
you know and i i left it at that i just

1109
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:03,200
left these lines here i was like you

1110
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:05,040
know okay it could work out that way

1111
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:07,520
now come back and look at the chart and

1112
00:45:07,520 --> 00:45:09,920
we're sinking to hell directly from the

1113
00:45:09,920 --> 00:45:11,599
area that

1114
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:12,960
that i have mentioned

1115
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,680
look at this 394 pips

1116
00:45:15,680 --> 00:45:19,599
just because it is tap here like when

1117
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:22,400
when you when you learn how to uh nasdaq

1118
00:45:22,400 --> 00:45:26,560
btc ripple okay when you learn how to um

1119
00:45:26,560 --> 00:45:28,960
you know like re-price you can get in on

1120
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:31,200
little opportunities that can turn into

1121
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,400
longer ones

1122
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,319
you know like you you don't really have

1123
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:35,920
to like

1124
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:38,160
utilize i'm going from here to here

1125
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,400
sometimes there's price gives you no

1126
00:45:40,400 --> 00:45:42,480
shift no change in it

1127
00:45:42,480 --> 00:45:45,119
so when price gives you no change in it

1128
00:45:45,119 --> 00:45:47,440
then you continue with that and you just

1129
00:45:47,440 --> 00:45:49,359
manage your risk by moving your

1130
00:45:49,359 --> 00:45:51,440
your um your stops up

1131
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:52,960
you know so let me go to knives that

1132
00:45:52,960 --> 00:45:54,560
should be falling with everything else

1133
00:45:54,560 --> 00:45:56,960
same way

1134
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,720
um

1135
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,960
maybe a tap into here

1136
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,800
but if it falls below this i expect the

1137
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:07,040
same stuff that's going on with the us30

1138
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,920
oh naz has some area down here us-30

1139
00:46:09,920 --> 00:46:12,720
doesn't look at that let me see if s p

1140
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:17,200
500 has oh s p does

1141
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:20,390
that's strange then

1142
00:46:20,390 --> 00:46:23,550
[Music]

1143
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:26,000
i don't know why all of this is moving i

1144
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:26,839
don't

1145
00:46:26,839 --> 00:46:30,720
know all right right here

1146
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:34,079
trading b is always giving me some

1147
00:46:34,079 --> 00:46:36,079
some issues uh

1148
00:46:36,079 --> 00:46:37,760
just double check make sure nothing's

1149
00:46:37,760 --> 00:46:42,040
open oh spotify is

1150
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,720
is is every like you guys see me fine

1151
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,480
i'm not like glitching or anything like

1152
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:49,760
that can you guys hear me

1153
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:56,480
let me properly

1154
00:46:56,480 --> 00:47:00,240
let me just double check this guys

1155
00:47:05,200 --> 00:47:06,720
all right

1156
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,960
yeah usually um the quality gets a

1157
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:10,720
little more choppier

1158
00:47:10,720 --> 00:47:12,800
um

1159
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,359
when um

1160
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:17,520
i'm on this

1161
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:20,720
let me see so

1162
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:25,599
yeah th this has no area back here so

1163
00:47:25,599 --> 00:47:28,400
that's interesting that um

1164
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,400
if there's no area back here in the us

1165
00:47:30,400 --> 00:47:33,280
30 it's interesting to see oh that's

1166
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:34,640
what it is

1167
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:38,880
um tech stocks are probably doing well

1168
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:40,160
it's doing a little better than the

1169
00:47:40,160 --> 00:47:43,280
stocks on okay not now i see what it is

1170
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:45,200
so let's see we got a double bounce in

1171
00:47:45,200 --> 00:47:47,920
this area

1172
00:47:48,240 --> 00:47:50,960
we just took out this low here

1173
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:53,839
and then we may end up

1174
00:47:53,839 --> 00:47:55,839
trading there's an imbalance here so

1175
00:47:55,839 --> 00:47:58,400
watch this

1176
00:47:59,040 --> 00:48:01,040
could get a reaction at that but there's

1177
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,960
also this little snd

1178
00:48:02,960 --> 00:48:04,640
mini snd in the middle that can be

1179
00:48:04,640 --> 00:48:06,400
responsible for this

1180
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,240
couldn't come and close this imbalance

1181
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:09,440
here

1182
00:48:09,440 --> 00:48:10,640
and then

1183
00:48:10,640 --> 00:48:15,000
continue up if it wanted to

1184
00:48:17,330 --> 00:48:20,530
[Music]

1185
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:25,280
yeah

1186
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:27,839
so smd here as well that it's

1187
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:28,800
sort of

1188
00:48:28,800 --> 00:48:33,640
leaving behind but it could mitigate it

1189
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,920
[Music]

1190
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,520
um so

1191
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:43,599
what what um what time frame do you

1192
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,480
yeah sound video just fine okay um what

1193
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:48,480
time frame do you usually trade nas from

1194
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:50,400
maybe i should just give you the top

1195
00:48:50,400 --> 00:48:51,760
down on that that might be a little

1196
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,000
better oh this is a nice area finazz

1197
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,680
right here

1198
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:58,400
this little spot here

1199
00:48:58,400 --> 00:49:00,640
it's a nice little spot watch that area

1200
00:49:00,640 --> 00:49:03,839
you could have um

1201
00:49:03,920 --> 00:49:07,119
a little push out of it

1202
00:49:08,000 --> 00:49:10,000
and this is from the hourly so

1203
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:12,079
if it does come down to this area you

1204
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:14,559
might have a little movement around this

1205
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:15,440
line

1206
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:16,800
and then

1207
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:19,119
like going back to the top to attack the

1208
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:20,319
upside

1209
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:22,240
but with the upside it could also just

1210
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:25,880
be coming to here

1211
00:49:31,440 --> 00:49:33,920
yeah it could also be coming up to here

1212
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:35,359
so you could have a

1213
00:49:35,359 --> 00:49:37,760
retracement up tap into this area and

1214
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:38,800
then

1215
00:49:38,800 --> 00:49:40,880
continuation down or you could have a

1216
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:44,000
tap right here back up to this area or

1217
00:49:44,000 --> 00:49:45,920
the low could be ran

1218
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:48,400
and then it comes up into this area and

1219
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:50,160
then

1220
00:49:50,160 --> 00:49:52,079
then continues down because it looked

1221
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:54,319
like um looks like it might continue to

1222
00:49:54,319 --> 00:49:55,680
sell off

1223
00:49:55,680 --> 00:49:58,160
um today

1224
00:49:58,160 --> 00:49:59,200
um

1225
00:49:59,200 --> 00:50:01,520
hour one

1226
00:50:01,520 --> 00:50:03,599
after that

1227
00:50:03,599 --> 00:50:04,800
oh okay

1228
00:50:04,800 --> 00:50:07,040
um

1229
00:50:07,760 --> 00:50:10,319
so yeah this this is a little uh

1230
00:50:10,319 --> 00:50:13,599
one hour scenario um i just gave you

1231
00:50:13,599 --> 00:50:16,160
price tap this imbalance already here it

1232
00:50:16,160 --> 00:50:18,000
looks like

1233
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,240
no it did not

1234
00:50:20,240 --> 00:50:24,319
so there's an imbalance here

1235
00:50:24,839 --> 00:50:28,000
um it's another imbalance directly above

1236
00:50:28,000 --> 00:50:30,400
another imbalance directly above another

1237
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:32,800
ballast directly wow this is

1238
00:50:32,800 --> 00:50:36,319
a lot a lot of imbalance here geez

1239
00:50:36,319 --> 00:50:38,240
you see there was this larger imbalance

1240
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,920
here that price came up and tapped into

1241
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:45,760
and then continued shorting um so let me

1242
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:49,839
actually look at the four hour

1243
00:50:51,839 --> 00:50:54,400
all right so we tapped into this smd

1244
00:50:54,400 --> 00:50:57,839
here on the four hour

1245
00:50:58,079 --> 00:51:00,079
right here

1246
00:51:00,079 --> 00:51:02,400
um

1247
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:09,839
we also are back in this area here

1248
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:14,800
now that this is

1249
00:51:19,280 --> 00:51:22,079
yeah we also typed here but i don't

1250
00:51:22,079 --> 00:51:25,359
really see this being an important area

1251
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:29,119
being this mitigated

1252
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,400
right after it was created

1253
00:51:32,400 --> 00:51:34,720
um we go down to 15

1254
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:37,839
look at what's happening here

1255
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:40,559
so it looks like the 15 we are touching

1256
00:51:40,559 --> 00:51:43,599
this area so yeah we could be um

1257
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,720
possibly trying to head back up

1258
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:51,079
let me just take this here

1259
00:51:51,760 --> 00:51:54,960
send that across

1260
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:58,240
take this area here move that out

1261
00:51:58,240 --> 00:52:00,559
yeah so we did get a tap into this area

1262
00:52:00,559 --> 00:52:02,720
we could have

1263
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:06,240
you know like sort of slight push up

1264
00:52:06,240 --> 00:52:08,880
um from this area so this you might see

1265
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:10,400
a double bottom

1266
00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:12,880
on the um

1267
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:16,000
the uh lower time frame

1268
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:16,839
you know

1269
00:52:16,839 --> 00:52:18,480
which

1270
00:52:18,480 --> 00:52:20,960
this slightly looks let me see the ohlc

1271
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:23,599
on this uh

1272
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:25,430
zero nine three six seven

1273
00:52:25,430 --> 00:52:27,599
[Music]

1274
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:29,599
zero nine three eleven

1275
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,200
so this is slightly lower than this

1276
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:34,800
um

1277
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,119
which could make the case for it

1278
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:39,280
heading back up

1279
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,280
could have a rejection at this

1280
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:47,400
fractal here

1281
00:52:47,520 --> 00:52:50,319
if it does come up comes back down into

1282
00:52:50,319 --> 00:52:52,160
the area so

1283
00:52:52,160 --> 00:52:54,160
let's say it goes like this

1284
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:55,680
up to that

1285
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:58,079
comes back into this area

1286
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:00,160
taps maybe into whatever imbalance that

1287
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,520
might have been left behind so we still

1288
00:53:01,520 --> 00:53:03,280
have five minutes to finish forming this

1289
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,520
candle this candle could eventually be a

1290
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:07,760
red candle down here so if that's the

1291
00:53:07,760 --> 00:53:10,559
case then this doesn't apply but um

1292
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:12,720
could tap up into there quickly reject

1293
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:15,200
the way tap back into wherever the start

1294
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:17,599
of this s and d would be

1295
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:18,720
um

1296
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:21,680
could tap back into that and then

1297
00:53:21,680 --> 00:53:23,200
this s and d

1298
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,839
to the imbalance up here or to the s and

1299
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:27,440
d further above

1300
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:30,480
that could be your target if this

1301
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:32,960
happens so mind you tap up into here

1302
00:53:32,960 --> 00:53:35,280
projection away from here and then push

1303
00:53:35,280 --> 00:53:36,720
up unless something is happening on a

1304
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:38,640
lower time frame we're showing that

1305
00:53:38,640 --> 00:53:41,440
it'll be a stronger push um within that

1306
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,160
area so that's just what i have for nas

1307
00:53:44,160 --> 00:53:45,920
in the the interim

1308
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:49,839
um daily it's the same daily as um

1309
00:53:49,839 --> 00:53:51,440
us 30.

1310
00:53:51,440 --> 00:53:55,359
um possibly running this low here

1311
00:53:55,359 --> 00:53:57,839
right here

1312
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:03,440
you know i was wondering if i um

1313
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,920
should do like a sunday zoom

1314
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:07,839
you could possibly run this low here so

1315
00:54:07,839 --> 00:54:09,280
just pay attention to this sometimes you

1316
00:54:09,280 --> 00:54:10,720
can run the low and then have a huge

1317
00:54:10,720 --> 00:54:11,920
push

1318
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,040
um

1319
00:54:13,040 --> 00:54:14,960
to the other direction and you see how

1320
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,280
it came up and filled the imbalance here

1321
00:54:17,280 --> 00:54:18,640
this is why you pay attention to the

1322
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:20,319
higher time frames just to get a little

1323
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:23,520
idea of what price could be doing from a

1324
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:25,760
higher time frame standpoint

1325
00:54:25,760 --> 00:54:27,920
and you're looking at what

1326
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:29,200
you know what's being laid out on the

1327
00:54:29,200 --> 00:54:31,119
lower time frame

1328
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,079
um

1329
00:54:32,079 --> 00:54:34,240
okay so i did 15

1330
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:38,640
and i did hour for nas four hour um it's

1331
00:54:38,640 --> 00:54:40,559
probably like the oh we did four hour

1332
00:54:40,559 --> 00:54:42,400
already that's right we came here so we

1333
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:44,319
said we tapped into this area

1334
00:54:44,319 --> 00:54:47,359
you know pushed back up um this candle

1335
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:50,000
still has two hours on it to go so this

1336
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:52,559
candle could be down here and before you

1337
00:54:52,559 --> 00:54:54,480
know it you know like

1338
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:57,359
it'll be up into up into this thing here

1339
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,559
or it can be well below this down here

1340
00:55:00,559 --> 00:55:02,160
so you can have the rejection to the run

1341
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,160
of this low

1342
00:55:04,160 --> 00:55:06,000
which the run of this low is likely

1343
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,559
today you know so just you know consider

1344
00:55:08,559 --> 00:55:09,440
that

1345
00:55:09,440 --> 00:55:10,319
um

1346
00:55:10,319 --> 00:55:13,440
but yeah you this candle could

1347
00:55:13,440 --> 00:55:16,640
end up closing any any way you want so

1348
00:55:16,640 --> 00:55:18,240
we just got to look at the lower time

1349
00:55:18,240 --> 00:55:20,960
frames to kind of get an idea of

1350
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:22,319
um

1351
00:55:22,319 --> 00:55:24,640
what what could potential like how this

1352
00:55:24,640 --> 00:55:26,319
candle could potentially close because

1353
00:55:26,319 --> 00:55:29,359
this is this has two hours left on it

1354
00:55:29,359 --> 00:55:30,559
um

1355
00:55:30,559 --> 00:55:33,280
and uh you mentioned uh

1356
00:55:33,280 --> 00:55:35,440
bitcoin

1357
00:55:35,440 --> 00:55:38,799
uh bitcoin on what time frame

1358
00:55:41,520 --> 00:55:44,160
yeah so i i was um on sunday i think it

1359
00:55:44,160 --> 00:55:46,079
was a sunday it might have been a sunday

1360
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,520
i don't know um

1361
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:49,280
i was talking to a friend about shorting

1362
00:55:49,280 --> 00:55:51,760
this um i think it was in a 15-minute

1363
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,280
time frame i tell them it's best to look

1364
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:55,119
at bitcoin in the 15-minute time frame

1365
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,640
because um

1366
00:55:56,640 --> 00:55:58,640
because it's so volatile there's so many

1367
00:55:58,640 --> 00:56:00,880
wicks and drags everywhere and it's hard

1368
00:56:00,880 --> 00:56:03,839
to like mark up uh zones you know so

1369
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,160
it's better to look at zones from the 15

1370
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,160
minute time frame because

1371
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,960
it's just overall easier to read price

1372
00:56:10,960 --> 00:56:13,119
on that for bitcoin

1373
00:56:13,119 --> 00:56:14,160
um

1374
00:56:14,160 --> 00:56:16,480
so i told them the shorting from here i

1375
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,240
said we get to run up the low we get a

1376
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,920
tap back into the area and then it

1377
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:22,160
leaves so i said

1378
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:24,240
you don't want to get out of this area

1379
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:27,280
or this area unless you see some type of

1380
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:30,880
bullish you know shift in price

1381
00:56:30,880 --> 00:56:31,839
and

1382
00:56:31,839 --> 00:56:35,119
look at where it ended up going

1383
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:36,160
from

1384
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:38,720
28 000

1385
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:41,599
the low of this is 20.

1386
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,240
so 8 000 ago i mentioned bitcoin was

1387
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,480
shorting

1388
00:56:46,480 --> 00:56:47,920
and it was just to like some of these

1389
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:49,599
humble areas i didn't think it was gonna

1390
00:56:49,599 --> 00:56:52,079
run the low of 25 000 anything like that

1391
00:56:52,079 --> 00:56:54,880
but if you don't see any change in

1392
00:56:54,880 --> 00:56:56,160
behavior

1393
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:58,960
you continue to take this thing down

1394
00:56:58,960 --> 00:57:02,400
there's no no structural highs being ran

1395
00:57:02,400 --> 00:57:05,280
for you to want to get out

1396
00:57:05,280 --> 00:57:06,880
and that's you know

1397
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:08,720
intermediary structure or major

1398
00:57:08,720 --> 00:57:09,920
structure

1399
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:11,040
so

1400
00:57:11,040 --> 00:57:13,760
this whole thing this whole ride down is

1401
00:57:13,760 --> 00:57:15,920
something that you know if he stayed in

1402
00:57:15,920 --> 00:57:18,079
he could have caught but this was

1403
00:57:18,079 --> 00:57:20,160
i don't even you know what i i wasn't

1404
00:57:20,160 --> 00:57:21,200
even

1405
00:57:21,200 --> 00:57:23,119
yeah i wasn't even here in new york when

1406
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:24,799
i mentioned this to him

1407
00:57:24,799 --> 00:57:26,240
i wasn't even home i think i was

1408
00:57:26,240 --> 00:57:28,079
traveling when i saw this

1409
00:57:28,079 --> 00:57:29,839
so it's just like those little things

1410
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:30,960
you know like

1411
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,760
but yeah the bitcoin is um

1412
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,200
oh four hour down okay

1413
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:40,319
yeah because i tend to like just come on

1414
00:57:40,319 --> 00:57:42,799
weekends and and

1415
00:57:42,799 --> 00:57:45,440
still shopping my skills sort of

1416
00:57:45,440 --> 00:57:47,040
using that

1417
00:57:47,040 --> 00:57:49,359
um

1418
00:57:53,119 --> 00:57:55,839
so

1419
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:59,359
see we have an imbalance here that price

1420
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,040
already reacted to we have another

1421
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:03,920
imbalance here

1422
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:07,480
um

1423
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,160
we could come into somewhere within this

1424
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:17,359
area and react

1425
00:58:17,440 --> 00:58:21,400
um back up

1426
00:58:25,440 --> 00:58:30,839
yeah like somewhere within this area

1427
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,040
yeah so it's it's somewhere between

1428
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:44,559
i would say more so it's somewhere

1429
00:58:44,559 --> 00:58:47,680
between 19 and and 17.

1430
00:58:47,680 --> 00:58:48,720
um

1431
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,440
but for right now um

1432
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,520
i would just have this as

1433
00:58:55,760 --> 00:58:59,920
a mark of where price could touch

1434
00:59:02,480 --> 00:59:04,799
and this is the imbalance let me see if

1435
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:07,200
it actually hit it already

1436
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,280
yeah look at that imbalance tap right

1437
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:10,160
here

1438
00:59:10,160 --> 00:59:11,599
this is what i'm saying zone is own and

1439
00:59:11,599 --> 00:59:13,760
balance and balance balance to zone zone

1440
00:59:13,760 --> 00:59:15,760
and balance you know all the same thing

1441
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:18,240
on every market everywhere all the same

1442
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:20,400
thing you just learn this and it becomes

1443
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,319
like so much easier for you

1444
00:59:22,319 --> 00:59:23,680
so um

1445
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:27,040
there could be a double bottom here um

1446
00:59:27,040 --> 00:59:28,319
this

1447
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:30,160
tap into this area

1448
00:59:30,160 --> 00:59:32,880
you see imbalance to zone

1449
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:34,480
to potentially

1450
00:59:34,480 --> 00:59:36,160
zone in a smaller time frame maybe

1451
00:59:36,160 --> 00:59:37,599
somewhere around here

1452
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:41,040
um and then push up above the area

1453
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:43,440
um that it traded out of that could

1454
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:45,440
potentially happen those things

1455
00:59:45,440 --> 00:59:48,480
you know often happen so

1456
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:51,280
you have this low put in your price

1457
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:52,640
trade above it

1458
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:55,200
and then price comes back down into it

1459
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,359
so this could just be mitigating it from

1460
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:00,640
a lower time frame

1461
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:03,920
let me see so you get another

1462
01:00:03,920 --> 01:00:05,680
bounce in here

1463
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,920
um

1464
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:11,359
this could be wyckoff happening

1465
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,760
you know s-c-a-r-s-t

1466
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:19,920
sign of strength

1467
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:22,160
uh

1468
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:23,599
um

1469
01:00:23,599 --> 01:00:25,760
this could potentially still run some of

1470
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,359
these lows here

1471
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,680
but if it doesn't then

1472
01:00:29,680 --> 01:00:31,920
um you should see some movement back up

1473
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:34,319
into this area potentially

1474
01:00:34,319 --> 01:00:36,400
this s and d here

1475
01:00:36,400 --> 01:00:39,040
maybe back up into this area at 21 and

1476
01:00:39,040 --> 01:00:41,040
then could fall out of 21 and end up

1477
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,000
running all the lows here at 20

1478
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:46,240
and then after

1479
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:47,440
coming from

1480
01:00:47,440 --> 01:00:50,000
20 you could have a huge push up that

1481
01:00:50,000 --> 01:00:52,720
runs this area

1482
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,280
21 760.

1483
01:00:55,280 --> 01:00:57,200
you could dip below here end up running

1484
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:01,119
21 760. if it runs 21 760 and it pushes

1485
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:01,920
up

1486
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:03,520
then that means that

1487
01:01:03,520 --> 01:01:05,760
you know we're looking to

1488
01:01:05,760 --> 01:01:07,839
come back to at least some of these

1489
01:01:07,839 --> 01:01:11,040
areas maybe up here within the 25 region

1490
01:01:11,040 --> 01:01:13,040
or up here within

1491
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:15,839
the 27 region that's only if this

1492
01:01:15,839 --> 01:01:17,200
continues to

1493
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:18,799
you know play out the way it is but it

1494
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:20,880
looks like it's wyckoff's accumulation

1495
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:24,240
happening here

1496
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,000
um can you check eth ethereum theorem

1497
01:01:28,000 --> 01:01:29,599
should be the same thing

1498
01:01:29,599 --> 01:01:31,839
um

1499
01:01:34,000 --> 01:01:38,040
i think it's a four hour

1500
01:01:40,000 --> 01:01:42,240
um

1501
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,400
just take a look at where price is right

1502
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:48,559
now

1503
01:01:48,559 --> 01:01:51,520
prices here within this area price could

1504
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,280
have a little pump from here

1505
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,000
this is um

1506
01:01:56,000 --> 01:01:59,359
s d zone edits in

1507
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:07,839
could have a slight pump up from here

1508
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:14,000
but if it falls below here

1509
01:02:15,760 --> 01:02:19,039
this area seems mitigated already

1510
01:02:19,039 --> 01:02:21,839
um

1511
01:02:25,039 --> 01:02:28,720
so does this area here

1512
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:30,559
um

1513
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,039
but there could be a

1514
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,480
a slight

1515
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:36,799
tap

1516
01:02:37,280 --> 01:02:39,440
here um

1517
01:02:39,440 --> 01:02:42,319
yeah there could be a slight tap here

1518
01:02:42,319 --> 01:02:44,240
so if it ends up running

1519
01:02:44,240 --> 01:02:45,839
this

1520
01:02:45,839 --> 01:02:49,119
if it ends up running the low of um

1521
01:02:49,119 --> 01:02:53,640
1040 it can go to 966.

1522
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,760
um

1523
01:02:55,760 --> 01:02:57,680
and if it goes below

1524
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,200
906

1525
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,240
you can end up

1526
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:05,039
tapping into this imbalance here

1527
01:03:05,039 --> 01:03:07,920
at 862 and that could be

1528
01:03:07,920 --> 01:03:10,880
like a very strong imbalance to

1529
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:12,880
um send it back up

1530
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,319
i don't even know why i put that there i

1531
01:03:14,319 --> 01:03:16,559
was trying to get the line

1532
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:19,599
yeah it could be um

1533
01:03:20,640 --> 01:03:22,720
strong imbalance to uh send it back up

1534
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,400
so we already hit the first area you see

1535
01:03:24,400 --> 01:03:27,200
how we reacted to it bam

1536
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:28,720
remember that little pattern that i told

1537
01:03:28,720 --> 01:03:32,000
you guys about um

1538
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:33,920
this little thing here

1539
01:03:33,920 --> 01:03:35,680
so just be mindful again like i said

1540
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:36,880
this could be

1541
01:03:36,880 --> 01:03:39,440
you know just digging within this area

1542
01:03:39,440 --> 01:03:40,559
to

1543
01:03:40,559 --> 01:03:43,359
you know continue up

1544
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:45,440
you know so just pay attention to that

1545
01:03:45,440 --> 01:03:47,039
same thing with bitcoin

1546
01:03:47,039 --> 01:03:49,200
um and i imagine all the other cryptos

1547
01:03:49,200 --> 01:03:51,359
are kind of moving the same way

1548
01:03:51,359 --> 01:03:56,680
so um oh and you mentioned xrp right

1549
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:02,559
uh

1550
01:04:04,720 --> 01:04:06,160
um

1551
01:04:06,160 --> 01:04:11,440
so xrp got rejected out of this smd here

1552
01:04:11,440 --> 01:04:13,839
um

1553
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,960
object did i oh no i'm sorry wrong one

1554
01:04:16,960 --> 01:04:18,480
huh

1555
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:20,640
rejected out of this smd here i don't

1556
01:04:20,640 --> 01:04:24,240
think i put enough coffee in my

1557
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:27,119
coffee oh man

1558
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:30,880
slim gonna make me some coffee now

1559
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,839
so let's see it tapped into this fractal

1560
01:04:33,839 --> 01:04:35,200
here

1561
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,640
we got rejected from

1562
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:42,079
this smd here

1563
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,400
now we're coming back into this one that

1564
01:04:44,400 --> 01:04:46,480
we just left

1565
01:04:46,480 --> 01:04:49,760
so this could be coming into this area

1566
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,039
here

1567
01:04:51,039 --> 01:04:52,880
um

1568
01:04:52,880 --> 01:04:54,799
somewhere around 31

1569
01:04:54,799 --> 01:04:56,880
could be shorting down to 31 and

1570
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:59,200
potentially having

1571
01:04:59,200 --> 01:05:01,359
a push-up from this direction but if it

1572
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:03,359
doesn't and it runs this low it's more

1573
01:05:03,359 --> 01:05:04,880
than likely gonna run the rest of the

1574
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:06,000
lows too

1575
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:08,720
down to 29.

1576
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:10,960
so that's um

1577
01:05:10,960 --> 01:05:14,480
what what xrp can do

1578
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:15,840
let me go back and

1579
01:05:15,840 --> 01:05:17,119
[Music]

1580
01:05:17,119 --> 01:05:20,480
and uh take a look at us 30 see what we

1581
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:22,760
got going on here

1582
01:05:22,760 --> 01:05:25,909
[Music]

1583
01:05:26,240 --> 01:05:29,280
really good nazar

1584
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:36,920
you see what i'm saying guys

1585
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,280
you see like this

1586
01:05:41,359 --> 01:05:43,039
i literally just mentioned this to you

1587
01:05:43,039 --> 01:05:45,119
guys

1588
01:05:45,119 --> 01:05:47,119
talk about how we could essentially come

1589
01:05:47,119 --> 01:05:48,160
up

1590
01:05:48,160 --> 01:05:50,640
come back into the area and then go

1591
01:05:50,640 --> 01:05:53,039
along now we didn't tap into this we

1592
01:05:53,039 --> 01:05:55,119
just bowled through it but

1593
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:56,559
from a lower time frame i think we were

1594
01:05:56,559 --> 01:05:58,799
on the 15 when i had mentioned it the

1595
01:05:58,799 --> 01:06:00,720
same thing happens on every single time

1596
01:06:00,720 --> 01:06:01,599
frame

1597
01:06:01,599 --> 01:06:04,079
so

1598
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:06,240
we had this push up

1599
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:08,319
rejected from the imbalance

1600
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:11,119
down here found support on the snd

1601
01:06:11,119 --> 01:06:14,240
came back up above the area that we got

1602
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,400
rejected from came back into the area to

1603
01:06:18,400 --> 01:06:20,240
whatever s and d

1604
01:06:20,240 --> 01:06:22,960
over here or or imbalance might have

1605
01:06:22,960 --> 01:06:25,839
sent this price up and then

1606
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:27,520
we shot up to come to some of these

1607
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:29,599
areas here

1608
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:33,119
over and over and over and over and over

1609
01:06:33,119 --> 01:06:36,799
and over again over and over and over

1610
01:06:36,799 --> 01:06:38,880
again it happens

1611
01:06:38,880 --> 01:06:42,880
so many times so many different ways

1612
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,319
like

1613
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:47,520
like wow this is

1614
01:06:47,520 --> 01:06:49,440
it's beautiful

1615
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:51,599
you know like i love

1616
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:55,359
i love the charts i

1617
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:59,119
like oh my gosh

1618
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,839
this is

1619
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:07,119
this is amazing

1620
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,039
remember what i said pay attention to

1621
01:07:09,039 --> 01:07:12,880
that little thing that that like the

1622
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:14,880
little stab in the middle that i tell

1623
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,880
you guys about like

1624
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:19,920
very very important in the area like

1625
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:24,160
this very very very

1626
01:07:24,160 --> 01:07:25,839
important

1627
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,240
very important

1628
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:30,240
like once you spot those things it makes

1629
01:07:30,240 --> 01:07:32,640
it easier in terms of like the decisions

1630
01:07:32,640 --> 01:07:34,720
that you would make to do things

1631
01:07:34,720 --> 01:07:35,920
very

1632
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:38,559
very important

1633
01:07:38,559 --> 01:07:42,359
like there you go guys

1634
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:45,839
yeah so so this is this is what's

1635
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:50,079
currently happening with the us-30 um

1636
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:53,280
remember there's an smd here this smd

1637
01:07:53,280 --> 01:07:55,440
was responsible for breaking structure

1638
01:07:55,440 --> 01:07:57,119
to the downside so that's what makes

1639
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:58,640
this important and you get a little

1640
01:07:58,640 --> 01:08:00,880
rejection from here but remember we have

1641
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:04,079
this imbalance up above as well as a

1642
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:06,240
larger s and d

1643
01:08:06,240 --> 01:08:09,440
above that another imbalance in between

1644
01:08:09,440 --> 01:08:11,119
it another like

1645
01:08:11,119 --> 01:08:15,039
damn all of these imbalances

1646
01:08:15,599 --> 01:08:18,560
what time was this

1647
01:08:18,960 --> 01:08:20,640
oh this is where they had pushed price

1648
01:08:20,640 --> 01:08:24,080
up and sent it back down

1649
01:08:24,080 --> 01:08:26,319
yeah like this this is

1650
01:08:26,319 --> 01:08:28,799
very important to pay attention to the

1651
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:32,238
zones the the like everything very very

1652
01:08:32,238 --> 01:08:36,278
important to pay attention to

1653
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:50,120
let's see did i

1654
01:08:58,799 --> 01:09:02,920
what did i have for this

1655
01:09:06,719 --> 01:09:10,319
this is from a higher time frame

1656
01:09:11,359 --> 01:09:15,719
trying to figure out where this gold

1657
01:09:22,238 --> 01:09:24,080
so i have no idea where this is from but

1658
01:09:24,080 --> 01:09:26,158
i know that if i was on this time frame

1659
01:09:26,158 --> 01:09:27,920
it would be just like this

1660
01:09:27,920 --> 01:09:30,238
bam and balance tap

1661
01:09:30,238 --> 01:09:33,959
push up from there

1662
01:09:36,080 --> 01:09:37,920
and it's just i mean

1663
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,839
i didn't create these concepts and rules

1664
01:09:39,839 --> 01:09:42,158
i've heard of it and i just spent time

1665
01:09:42,158 --> 01:09:43,520
watching it

1666
01:09:43,520 --> 01:09:45,759
and i just found ways to make it easier

1667
01:09:45,759 --> 01:09:48,560
you know like i always say that um

1668
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:49,679
my uh

1669
01:09:49,679 --> 01:09:50,770
this could be from

1670
01:09:50,770 --> 01:09:53,839
[Music]

1671
01:09:53,920 --> 01:09:56,400
is this

1672
01:09:57,840 --> 01:10:01,719
maybe this is an hour

1673
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:06,960
uh yes that was the hourly imbalance

1674
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:10,719
that's why i had that a little higher um

1675
01:10:10,719 --> 01:10:13,280
but usually if i'm day trading

1676
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,760
the highest that i'll look at for the

1677
01:10:15,760 --> 01:10:18,320
day is

1678
01:10:18,320 --> 01:10:21,520
it's it's usually the the 15. um i'll go

1679
01:10:21,520 --> 01:10:23,120
to the hourly if i don't have any

1680
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:26,719
clarity on the 15 but the 15 is is great

1681
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:28,800
for day trading you really just got to

1682
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,280
find zones on the 15 and just use the

1683
01:10:31,280 --> 01:10:33,120
zones on the 15 to

1684
01:10:33,120 --> 01:10:35,440
take certain trades from

1685
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,159
or that could be your your like

1686
01:10:38,159 --> 01:10:40,880
current bias for

1687
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:44,440
you know where prices

1688
01:10:45,840 --> 01:10:48,960
see look like we mentioned

1689
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,440
we said that we can push up

1690
01:10:51,440 --> 01:10:53,760
come back into the area we tap into this

1691
01:10:53,760 --> 01:10:55,920
s and d that it's leaving behind

1692
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:57,760
remember i said pay attention to the smd

1693
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,840
that we're leaving behind

1694
01:10:59,840 --> 01:11:02,320
it can tap back into this area

1695
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:03,520
and then

1696
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:06,159
go long from here

1697
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:09,920
and what do we do we wait log for a bit

1698
01:11:09,920 --> 01:11:13,440
like this it's i'm trying to get you

1699
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,600
guys to understand how how powerful

1700
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:17,920
these um

1701
01:11:17,920 --> 01:11:20,880
like seeing these little things are um

1702
01:11:20,880 --> 01:11:22,640
and it'll help you with scalping and

1703
01:11:22,640 --> 01:11:24,400
help you with any long trades you need

1704
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:26,560
to take and you could utilize this stuff

1705
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,480
using like a penny lot size if you're

1706
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:30,080
not comfortable if you want to like

1707
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:32,000
learn someone else's system learn a

1708
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,840
little differently learn how to

1709
01:11:33,840 --> 01:11:35,600
implement this into your own type of

1710
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:38,719
trading you could still forward test and

1711
01:11:38,719 --> 01:11:40,320
you could forward test with a penny lot

1712
01:11:40,320 --> 01:11:42,719
it's pennies you know like

1713
01:11:42,719 --> 01:11:45,840
why not just forward test with pennies

1714
01:11:45,840 --> 01:11:47,840
and it helps you to to understand the

1715
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,239
market a little better

1716
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:52,800
it helps you to to notice a little more

1717
01:11:52,800 --> 01:11:54,480
um

1718
01:11:54,480 --> 01:11:55,730
stability at least

1719
01:11:55,730 --> 01:11:58,320
[Music]

1720
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:00,880
within a live market because everybody's

1721
01:12:00,880 --> 01:12:03,920
a genius in hindsight everybody

1722
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:05,679
and that's why you barely have people

1723
01:12:05,679 --> 01:12:07,760
coming out here to to do this stuff live

1724
01:12:07,760 --> 01:12:10,480
on youtube the hiding behind zooms and

1725
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:13,199
and all these different things because

1726
01:12:13,199 --> 01:12:15,360
some days it's a hit and other days it's

1727
01:12:15,360 --> 01:12:18,000
not you know and and or most days it's

1728
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:19,199
not you know

1729
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:20,239
so um

1730
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,920
some of them be called little 10 pip

1731
01:12:21,920 --> 01:12:22,960
trades

1732
01:12:22,960 --> 01:12:25,040
you know

1733
01:12:25,040 --> 01:12:27,120
i mean that that was a confidence factor

1734
01:12:27,120 --> 01:12:29,040
for me so i used to just take 10 pips

1735
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:31,280
and get out so i'd be like that

1736
01:12:31,280 --> 01:12:33,760
take that little bit and i'm out

1737
01:12:33,760 --> 01:12:36,080
and then i'm like no but this is going

1738
01:12:36,080 --> 01:12:37,920
100 pips after it hit here i'm

1739
01:12:37,920 --> 01:12:40,480
discounting you know or selling myself

1740
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:41,600
short

1741
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:44,080
and then that's when

1742
01:12:44,080 --> 01:12:45,360
you know i started to become more

1743
01:12:45,360 --> 01:12:47,360
comfortable started understanding zone

1744
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,679
zone and balanced imbalance you know all

1745
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:51,679
those different things and i'm that kind

1746
01:12:51,679 --> 01:12:53,040
of help to

1747
01:12:53,040 --> 01:12:54,239
um

1748
01:12:54,239 --> 01:12:55,920
you know sort of make my training take

1749
01:12:55,920 --> 01:12:57,280
off

1750
01:12:57,280 --> 01:12:58,320
and just

1751
01:12:58,320 --> 01:13:01,280
essentially made it different than

1752
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:03,920
than anybody else's trading that i know

1753
01:13:03,920 --> 01:13:05,280
i'm not saying that there are other

1754
01:13:05,280 --> 01:13:07,280
people who who are not profitable

1755
01:13:07,280 --> 01:13:08,239
there's a lot of people who are

1756
01:13:08,239 --> 01:13:09,440
profitable

1757
01:13:09,440 --> 01:13:11,679
um with their own trading styles even if

1758
01:13:11,679 --> 01:13:14,239
i don't necessarily agree with them

1759
01:13:14,239 --> 01:13:16,640
they're still profitable from it

1760
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:18,159
you know so it's just really finding

1761
01:13:18,159 --> 01:13:20,640
something that works for you

1762
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:23,199
i don't know that for me precision is

1763
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,199
like the only thing that i would ever

1764
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:26,320
consider

1765
01:13:26,320 --> 01:13:29,120
like you know working for me

1766
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:30,560
i get that other people get more

1767
01:13:30,560 --> 01:13:32,640
accurate even down to like

1768
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:35,280
the one second time frame but

1769
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:37,840
you know i'm comfortable here i mean if

1770
01:13:37,840 --> 01:13:39,360
you could learn this technique and trade

1771
01:13:39,360 --> 01:13:41,120
on the 15 second

1772
01:13:41,120 --> 01:13:42,400
great

1773
01:13:42,400 --> 01:13:45,600
on the 15 second you guys can

1774
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:48,480
learn this from the the one minute you

1775
01:13:48,480 --> 01:13:49,840
can trade this on any time frame so if

1776
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,360
you go to the 15 second and you see

1777
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:55,600
these things happening faster oh my gosh

1778
01:13:55,600 --> 01:13:57,120
you'd be great

1779
01:13:57,120 --> 01:14:00,239
hey duraj what's up how's everything how

1780
01:14:00,239 --> 01:14:01,920
are you from india

1781
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:04,560
great peace and love from jamaica

1782
01:14:04,560 --> 01:14:07,199
yeah man

1783
01:14:09,360 --> 01:14:10,400
yeah

1784
01:14:10,400 --> 01:14:13,440
my friend john he swear he's he's uh

1785
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:16,320
jamaican i don't know why he he just

1786
01:14:16,320 --> 01:14:17,840
he swears he

1787
01:14:17,840 --> 01:14:19,840
he whenever i talk to him

1788
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:22,000
he's always like saying all of the words

1789
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,440
he knows in one sentence

1790
01:14:27,199 --> 01:14:29,199
yeah yeah

1791
01:14:29,199 --> 01:14:30,800
i didn't have the nerve to tell me that

1792
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,960
he really don't trust jamaicans right

1793
01:14:32,960 --> 01:14:35,520
yeah right

1794
01:14:35,760 --> 01:14:38,960
he was just kidding by the way

1795
01:14:39,440 --> 01:14:41,840
yeah so we we dropped below this low i

1796
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:43,120
want to see if it's going to come back

1797
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:46,000
and tap into this area here um it could

1798
01:14:46,000 --> 01:14:47,760
be there's a little imbalance in between

1799
01:14:47,760 --> 01:14:49,920
here

1800
01:14:50,159 --> 01:14:52,480
you know like somewhere between here

1801
01:14:52,480 --> 01:14:54,080
um

1802
01:14:54,080 --> 01:14:56,000
want to see if it's going to tap up into

1803
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,600
maybe some of these areas and then

1804
01:14:59,600 --> 01:15:02,960
you know continue short

1805
01:15:06,960 --> 01:15:08,640
let's see are we going to run the high

1806
01:15:08,640 --> 01:15:11,840
and then come back below it

1807
01:15:15,440 --> 01:15:18,000
sometimes this is where um

1808
01:15:18,000 --> 01:15:20,719
using candlestick structure can

1809
01:15:20,719 --> 01:15:24,480
you know mess you up because um

1810
01:15:24,480 --> 01:15:26,480
you see you have this area up you get

1811
01:15:26,480 --> 01:15:28,960
the slow you get the high

1812
01:15:28,960 --> 01:15:31,679
and you get a run of the low

1813
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:34,159
and then you come up usually you come up

1814
01:15:34,159 --> 01:15:36,880
into this area here

1815
01:15:36,880 --> 01:15:40,000
but if you see

1816
01:15:40,000 --> 01:15:42,560
price came all the way up to

1817
01:15:42,560 --> 01:15:44,320
the neck

1818
01:15:44,320 --> 01:15:47,360
of this area here

1819
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:50,320
and that's where it can get kind of

1820
01:15:50,320 --> 01:15:51,440
scary

1821
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:52,719
um

1822
01:15:52,719 --> 01:15:54,239
you know for

1823
01:15:54,239 --> 01:15:56,159
not necessarily knowing whether price is

1824
01:15:56,159 --> 01:15:58,080
going to short from the area or not

1825
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:01,199
sometimes it can go just a wick above it

1826
01:16:01,199 --> 01:16:03,679
and that wick above it guess where it

1827
01:16:03,679 --> 01:16:05,280
could be tapping

1828
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:07,840
right here

1829
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,239
right here

1830
01:16:12,960 --> 01:16:15,280
so you can get a wick above it and it's

1831
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,280
going above this area

1832
01:16:17,280 --> 01:16:19,199
that you have usually with candlestick

1833
01:16:19,199 --> 01:16:21,280
structure but this is happening within

1834
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,159
the area of your imbalance with an area

1835
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,719
also that's directly above it

1836
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,000
so you have to account for

1837
01:16:30,000 --> 01:16:31,520
just what's

1838
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:35,199
like slightly above this area

1839
01:16:35,199 --> 01:16:36,800
and this could be the candle that pulls

1840
01:16:36,800 --> 01:16:38,400
above this high

1841
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:40,239
grabs the high

1842
01:16:40,239 --> 01:16:42,320
pushes up to here that gives it the

1843
01:16:42,320 --> 01:16:43,199
little

1844
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:44,960
stab like look

1845
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:46,400
and then

1846
01:16:46,400 --> 01:16:48,640
trades away like that's a possibility

1847
01:16:48,640 --> 01:16:50,640
like sometimes those things happen you

1848
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,360
know

1849
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:54,000
so you just want to

1850
01:16:54,000 --> 01:16:55,760
be open to that like when you're

1851
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,560
utilizing the candlestick structure in

1852
01:16:58,560 --> 01:17:01,679
in certain areas you want to be open to

1853
01:17:01,679 --> 01:17:04,000
like just just a little

1854
01:17:04,000 --> 01:17:06,000
shift or change in price

1855
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:07,840
and understand that

1856
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:10,640
you might have the right idea here

1857
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:12,560
when you're looking for that

1858
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:15,600
but just in the wrong area

1859
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,840
you know so that could happen

1860
01:17:17,840 --> 01:17:20,239
there's still other areas up here guys

1861
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:21,360
um

1862
01:17:21,360 --> 01:17:24,000
you know just in case this does run

1863
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:25,120
um

1864
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:27,600
there there's this whole area within

1865
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:30,600
here

1866
01:17:33,100 --> 01:17:34,560
[Music]

1867
01:17:34,560 --> 01:17:36,400
this whole area here that's a bit

1868
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:38,239
stronger

1869
01:17:38,239 --> 01:17:40,000
um

1870
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:41,840
you know than than some of these areas i

1871
01:17:41,840 --> 01:17:45,760
told you this s d does matter um

1872
01:17:45,760 --> 01:17:47,360
here

1873
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:50,239
no sorry it was this one

1874
01:17:50,239 --> 01:17:52,239
yeah but this this smd it comes from a

1875
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:54,159
larger area um

1876
01:17:54,159 --> 01:17:57,199
so there's more volume in this area

1877
01:17:57,199 --> 01:17:59,440
so this way you got to tap into it right

1878
01:17:59,440 --> 01:18:01,280
here at the bottom of it then you got a

1879
01:18:01,280 --> 01:18:02,880
quick rejection away

1880
01:18:02,880 --> 01:18:04,080
and then

1881
01:18:04,080 --> 01:18:05,600
price pushes up this is what i'm saying

1882
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,679
when it when it comes up into these s

1883
01:18:07,679 --> 01:18:10,239
and d's and it gets these like reactions

1884
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:12,320
from just the tip of it just the bottom

1885
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:13,440
of it

1886
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:16,320
oftentimes i see that it rejects away

1887
01:18:16,320 --> 01:18:18,320
and then it goes up and trades through

1888
01:18:18,320 --> 01:18:20,560
but it can still trade through it

1889
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,080
and then if there's a wick above it

1890
01:18:24,080 --> 01:18:26,560
what what can often happen is

1891
01:18:26,560 --> 01:18:29,760
that you'll see um the wick goes above

1892
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:32,159
it but the body closes inside and still

1893
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,560
makes its way back down

1894
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:36,239
and usually that's like

1895
01:18:36,239 --> 01:18:38,480
you know up from an area like this like

1896
01:18:38,480 --> 01:18:41,840
this candle here

1897
01:18:41,920 --> 01:18:45,520
you see so if you put a um

1898
01:18:46,560 --> 01:18:48,159
if you take this

1899
01:18:48,159 --> 01:18:49,520
right here

1900
01:18:49,520 --> 01:18:51,040
you see how the wick ended up going

1901
01:18:51,040 --> 01:18:53,199
above the area

1902
01:18:53,199 --> 01:18:55,760
and then price traded down

1903
01:18:55,760 --> 01:18:57,679
like at times you i was explaining this

1904
01:18:57,679 --> 01:18:59,520
yesterday at times you

1905
01:18:59,520 --> 01:19:02,400
you you could have that um

1906
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:04,239
even the dax 30 is doing the same thing

1907
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,320
yeah all of them all of them tend to

1908
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:07,440
move with

1909
01:19:07,440 --> 01:19:12,080
the the uh the s p 500 so look the us 30

1910
01:19:12,080 --> 01:19:14,080
you know obviously we just saw that s p

1911
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:15,679
500 is doing that

1912
01:19:15,679 --> 01:19:19,040
nas is doing the same thing

1913
01:19:19,040 --> 01:19:21,760
you know this is japan's exchange doing

1914
01:19:21,760 --> 01:19:24,080
the same thing

1915
01:19:24,080 --> 01:19:26,000
china's exchange is just a little bit

1916
01:19:26,000 --> 01:19:27,679
rogue it's a little bit different than

1917
01:19:27,679 --> 01:19:29,120
ours

1918
01:19:29,120 --> 01:19:30,719
the movements are different maybe it's

1919
01:19:30,719 --> 01:19:31,679
just

1920
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:33,199
the fact that

1921
01:19:33,199 --> 01:19:36,159
they essentially control the world sorta

1922
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:37,920
you know because they're a major

1923
01:19:37,920 --> 01:19:40,239
exporting country um

1924
01:19:40,239 --> 01:19:41,840
so they move a little differently than

1925
01:19:41,840 --> 01:19:42,800
us

1926
01:19:42,800 --> 01:19:45,440
slightly differently um than we do but

1927
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:47,760
yeah all of them they move in in the

1928
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:49,120
same fashion

1929
01:19:49,120 --> 01:19:51,199
same exact stuff happening

1930
01:19:51,199 --> 01:19:52,640
on every chart i don't know why i was

1931
01:19:52,640 --> 01:19:54,000
still looking at nas i thought i was

1932
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:57,440
looking at the us 30 just now

1933
01:19:57,440 --> 01:20:00,320
i thought this was the us 30 but

1934
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,320
but this is what i'm saying like you

1935
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:03,360
know

1936
01:20:03,360 --> 01:20:05,840
pay attention to like before you're

1937
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:07,920
shorting pay attention to certain areas

1938
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,800
that are still possibly directly above

1939
01:20:10,800 --> 01:20:12,080
it

1940
01:20:12,080 --> 01:20:13,120
because

1941
01:20:13,120 --> 01:20:15,600
those areas that are directly above

1942
01:20:15,600 --> 01:20:17,840
you know like you can get caught up in

1943
01:20:17,840 --> 01:20:20,400
trying to short from this area because

1944
01:20:20,400 --> 01:20:23,120
you you notice them

1945
01:20:23,120 --> 01:20:24,800
candlestick structure

1946
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,679
but then candlestick structure absent of

1947
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:30,880
a particular area

1948
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:31,679
is

1949
01:20:31,679 --> 01:20:34,239
is where you get jammed up it needs to

1950
01:20:34,239 --> 01:20:37,600
be in in an area that's highly likely to

1951
01:20:37,600 --> 01:20:39,040
short from

1952
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,520
uh any idea why they move like because

1953
01:20:41,520 --> 01:20:44,800
um the the us dollar is what dominates

1954
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,000
um the rest of the world you know like i

1955
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:50,320
i mentioned yesterday all the debts

1956
01:20:50,320 --> 01:20:51,730
everything that um

1957
01:20:51,730 --> 01:20:52,960
[Music]

1958
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,120
you know like is is tied up into any

1959
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,280
debt of another country or paid from one

1960
01:20:57,280 --> 01:20:59,520
country to the next most of most

1961
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:01,360
business around the world is dealt with

1962
01:21:01,360 --> 01:21:03,840
in the us dollar

1963
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,120
so

1964
01:21:05,120 --> 01:21:07,600
whatever is happening with the us dollar

1965
01:21:07,600 --> 01:21:10,560
is also going to affect other countries

1966
01:21:10,560 --> 01:21:11,600
because

1967
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:14,800
the world is dollar dominated

1968
01:21:14,800 --> 01:21:16,159
you know so

1969
01:21:16,159 --> 01:21:18,239
that's why all of the exchanges tend to

1970
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:20,400
move with it but even um

1971
01:21:20,400 --> 01:21:22,480
even at night like or in the asian

1972
01:21:22,480 --> 01:21:23,440
session

1973
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:25,840
when the u.s studies closed we tend to

1974
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:28,719
follow the asian exchanges too

1975
01:21:28,719 --> 01:21:30,960
you know we tend to follow japan and and

1976
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,360
hong kong's exchange also throughout the

1977
01:21:33,360 --> 01:21:34,639
asian session

1978
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:35,920
so it's good to

1979
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:38,159
you know potentially look at that as

1980
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:42,639
some sort of um confluence as well

1981
01:21:42,639 --> 01:21:44,239
you see look this is this is what i was

1982
01:21:44,239 --> 01:21:46,560
talking about like

1983
01:21:46,560 --> 01:21:48,639
let's say you you ended up shorting from

1984
01:21:48,639 --> 01:21:50,719
here

1985
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:51,760
and

1986
01:21:51,760 --> 01:21:53,920
you got caught in a short

1987
01:21:53,920 --> 01:21:55,520
pulled you back up

1988
01:21:55,520 --> 01:21:57,360
you know and now you're in drawdown up

1989
01:21:57,360 --> 01:21:58,320
here

1990
01:21:58,320 --> 01:22:01,120
there's always that opportunity to come

1991
01:22:01,120 --> 01:22:02,320
back

1992
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:04,880
out of drawdown and potentially into

1993
01:22:04,880 --> 01:22:06,000
profit

1994
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:07,600
you know if

1995
01:22:07,600 --> 01:22:10,000
you understood what was happening within

1996
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:12,239
this era there wouldn't be a panic for

1997
01:22:12,239 --> 01:22:13,199
you

1998
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:15,199
you know yeah it could just push right

1999
01:22:15,199 --> 01:22:17,360
out of this area and go straight up you

2000
01:22:17,360 --> 01:22:19,280
know like if news happened or something

2001
01:22:19,280 --> 01:22:21,840
like that of course it could do that

2002
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:23,440
you know but

2003
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,760
you also have to understand that that

2004
01:22:25,760 --> 01:22:27,760
there are certain areas that you might

2005
01:22:27,760 --> 01:22:29,679
have just gotten a little early i find

2006
01:22:29,679 --> 01:22:31,840
it to where sometimes i get in early too

2007
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,520
i think i have a trade um

2008
01:22:36,159 --> 01:22:38,000
was it

2009
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:41,920
was it gj i think it was

2010
01:22:48,320 --> 01:22:49,310
yeah so look at here

2011
01:22:49,310 --> 01:22:51,760
[Music]

2012
01:22:51,760 --> 01:22:53,840
i drew this let me um

2013
01:22:53,840 --> 01:22:55,360
take this out

2014
01:22:55,360 --> 01:22:58,159
and i said we were shorting from here

2015
01:22:58,159 --> 01:23:01,120
and we went up took the high and then

2016
01:23:01,120 --> 01:23:02,560
shorted

2017
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,159
back into the area that i thought we

2018
01:23:04,159 --> 01:23:05,920
were shorting to

2019
01:23:05,920 --> 01:23:08,800
then we went all the way up here

2020
01:23:08,800 --> 01:23:11,280
and guess what price pulled all the way

2021
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,000
back to come to the area that i said we

2022
01:23:14,000 --> 01:23:15,840
were shorting from so even if we missed

2023
01:23:15,840 --> 01:23:17,040
it here

2024
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:18,880
this was still an important area for

2025
01:23:18,880 --> 01:23:20,480
later on

2026
01:23:20,480 --> 01:23:22,159
and i don't know if this was news or

2027
01:23:22,159 --> 01:23:24,639
something happened um

2028
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:25,760
with this i don't know what the hell

2029
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:27,120
this was but

2030
01:23:27,120 --> 01:23:30,080
we pushed back into the area and then

2031
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,440
look at the massive movement up

2032
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:35,920
after just touching the area so so let's

2033
01:23:35,920 --> 01:23:39,520
say you know you you took a trade here

2034
01:23:39,520 --> 01:23:41,920
you would have immediately

2035
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:44,639
been pulled up into

2036
01:23:44,639 --> 01:23:46,400
100 pips

2037
01:23:46,400 --> 01:23:49,040
flash like that bam

2038
01:23:49,040 --> 01:23:52,000
100 pips

2039
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:54,560
as soon as you tapped into that order a

2040
01:23:54,560 --> 01:23:57,440
hundred pips immediately because news

2041
01:23:57,440 --> 01:23:58,800
happened

2042
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:01,040
and i told you guys

2043
01:24:01,040 --> 01:24:02,800
news does not

2044
01:24:02,800 --> 01:24:05,440
matter at all

2045
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:07,280
it does not

2046
01:24:07,280 --> 01:24:08,320
matter

2047
01:24:08,320 --> 01:24:10,560
at all like

2048
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:12,320
if if you're good with technical

2049
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,639
analysis if you're efficient with it

2050
01:24:14,639 --> 01:24:16,639
you can catch the technicals and be like

2051
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:18,639
oh some news happened somewhere what was

2052
01:24:18,639 --> 01:24:19,760
that

2053
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:21,840
you know but this this is look this is

2054
01:24:21,840 --> 01:24:23,280
one candle

2055
01:24:23,280 --> 01:24:27,760
this is a one minute candle like this

2056
01:24:28,960 --> 01:24:31,280
from from an area that i said price was

2057
01:24:31,280 --> 01:24:33,920
going to

2058
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:38,080
bam tapped into it

2059
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:40,560
and gone

2060
01:24:40,560 --> 01:24:41,760
look at this

2061
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:43,520
and it wasn't this line that that i had

2062
01:24:43,520 --> 01:24:45,199
mentioned um pressures coming to was the

2063
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:48,320
imbalance that was in here

2064
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:51,280
bam tapped in and you up 100 pips

2065
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,440
immediately because news happened and

2066
01:24:53,440 --> 01:24:55,679
you were in a safe spot

2067
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:58,320
you were in a spot that you knew stop

2068
01:24:58,320 --> 01:25:00,400
losses were back here

2069
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:02,960
because this is where they began to buy

2070
01:25:02,960 --> 01:25:03,840
in

2071
01:25:03,840 --> 01:25:04,719
why

2072
01:25:04,719 --> 01:25:07,920
to shift price above

2073
01:25:07,920 --> 01:25:10,000
they bought in here and they are

2074
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,280
responsible

2075
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,199
for moving structure

2076
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:15,840
so they move structure from the lowest

2077
01:25:15,840 --> 01:25:17,280
point of here

2078
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:18,719
this is where they begin to shift

2079
01:25:18,719 --> 01:25:20,960
structure from down here

2080
01:25:20,960 --> 01:25:24,560
so this becomes a protected low

2081
01:25:24,560 --> 01:25:27,280
and if they were to make their way back

2082
01:25:27,280 --> 01:25:29,600
down to anywhere

2083
01:25:29,600 --> 01:25:31,520
it would be

2084
01:25:31,520 --> 01:25:32,960
down to

2085
01:25:32,960 --> 01:25:36,080
their protected stop loss

2086
01:25:36,080 --> 01:25:39,520
and look right back up

2087
01:25:39,520 --> 01:25:42,239
so guess where their new protected stop

2088
01:25:42,239 --> 01:25:44,400
losses

2089
01:25:44,400 --> 01:25:46,719
here

2090
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:48,880
because this is where they began to

2091
01:25:48,880 --> 01:25:51,040
shift structure to the upside

2092
01:25:51,040 --> 01:25:52,560
but if you look

2093
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,800
structure was shifted here and we put in

2094
01:25:54,800 --> 01:25:58,320
another low right here

2095
01:25:59,840 --> 01:26:02,159
so if we put in this low

2096
01:26:02,159 --> 01:26:06,000
and did we did we get another high

2097
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:08,400
slightly

2098
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:10,159
a little

2099
01:26:10,159 --> 01:26:11,679
a little um

2100
01:26:11,679 --> 01:26:15,199
smidge above that don't really like that

2101
01:26:15,199 --> 01:26:16,719
um

2102
01:26:16,719 --> 01:26:18,800
but then if you look we

2103
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:21,199
we shifted down below

2104
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:23,360
we shifted down below it and we went

2105
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:26,000
back up to the smd that was responsible

2106
01:26:26,000 --> 01:26:28,719
for the break of structure

2107
01:26:28,719 --> 01:26:31,679
this s d is what sent price down

2108
01:26:31,679 --> 01:26:33,280
to break the structure

2109
01:26:33,280 --> 01:26:35,760
so we head back up to that we tap into

2110
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:37,120
that

2111
01:26:37,120 --> 01:26:38,719
and then

2112
01:26:38,719 --> 01:26:40,880
we leave down

2113
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,960
but this is why understanding s and d's

2114
01:26:42,960 --> 01:26:45,120
and and what their purpose

2115
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:46,560
you know is

2116
01:26:46,560 --> 01:26:48,080
this is

2117
01:26:48,080 --> 01:26:49,760
you know why you consider this because

2118
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,360
these are also

2119
01:26:51,360 --> 01:26:52,960
this is a high

2120
01:26:52,960 --> 01:26:54,480
this is a low

2121
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:56,480
this is a high back in

2122
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,080
this is a low

2123
01:26:58,080 --> 01:26:59,679
this is a high

2124
01:26:59,679 --> 01:27:01,360
this is a low

2125
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,880
so if you see that this is the way the

2126
01:27:02,880 --> 01:27:04,719
trend let me actually zoom in so you

2127
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:06,400
guys can see a little better

2128
01:27:06,400 --> 01:27:07,760
if you see that this is the way the

2129
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,239
trend is going

2130
01:27:10,239 --> 01:27:12,239
with these highs and lows

2131
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,719
these become protected highs protected

2132
01:27:14,719 --> 01:27:17,600
highs protected highs protected highs

2133
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:20,400
and prices not going to shift up above

2134
01:27:20,400 --> 01:27:23,440
once this crew once this one here

2135
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:24,480
this high

2136
01:27:24,480 --> 01:27:27,280
created this new low

2137
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,159
you can expect price to come up to

2138
01:27:30,159 --> 01:27:32,639
this area here

2139
01:27:32,639 --> 01:27:34,480
and then give you a reaction back down

2140
01:27:34,480 --> 01:27:36,159
yeah it could come to the the middle of

2141
01:27:36,159 --> 01:27:37,760
the area as well

2142
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,920
you know that that's a possibility too

2143
01:27:39,920 --> 01:27:42,480
but oftentimes it mitigates like this is

2144
01:27:42,480 --> 01:27:44,239
the last high and low it mitigates the

2145
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:46,400
area entirely sometimes

2146
01:27:46,400 --> 01:27:49,040
with the s and d or maybe the fractal or

2147
01:27:49,040 --> 01:27:51,600
or the imbalance there was an imbalance

2148
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:54,719
play here that rejected it out um there

2149
01:27:54,719 --> 01:27:56,480
could have been like a fractal somewhere

2150
01:27:56,480 --> 01:27:59,760
up into here but it taps into that area

2151
01:27:59,760 --> 01:28:02,000
and then it continues so when you pay

2152
01:28:02,000 --> 01:28:04,800
attention to to structure

2153
01:28:04,800 --> 01:28:05,760
and

2154
01:28:05,760 --> 01:28:06,719
you know

2155
01:28:06,719 --> 01:28:09,280
how structure moves and and what are

2156
01:28:09,280 --> 01:28:12,080
protected highs and what are not

2157
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,080
then you end up staying out of certain

2158
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:15,600
trades like you might have seen price

2159
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:17,199
going up here and

2160
01:28:17,199 --> 01:28:19,199
people might have thought okay yeah

2161
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:21,199
we're gonna long and just take out this

2162
01:28:21,199 --> 01:28:22,480
high

2163
01:28:22,480 --> 01:28:24,400
take out this high and go to this order

2164
01:28:24,400 --> 01:28:26,880
block up here or this you know ict order

2165
01:28:26,880 --> 01:28:29,679
block or this um you know supply area

2166
01:28:29,679 --> 01:28:31,520
whatever it is and then no we get

2167
01:28:31,520 --> 01:28:34,239
stumped here

2168
01:28:34,560 --> 01:28:36,639
because this is a protected high

2169
01:28:36,639 --> 01:28:39,199
according to where structure has gone

2170
01:28:39,199 --> 01:28:42,080
down up down up down according to where

2171
01:28:42,080 --> 01:28:43,440
structure is going this is a protected

2172
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:44,639
high

2173
01:28:44,639 --> 01:28:47,360
so we can come be between this area and

2174
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:50,080
this area we have this entire range to

2175
01:28:50,080 --> 01:28:52,960
just play around and create liquidity

2176
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,120
all of that you create liquidity with

2177
01:28:55,120 --> 01:28:56,639
the equal lows

2178
01:28:56,639 --> 01:28:58,560
you give it equal highs

2179
01:28:58,560 --> 01:29:00,480
you run it

2180
01:29:00,480 --> 01:29:02,560
tap into the area then run the equal

2181
01:29:02,560 --> 01:29:03,760
lows

2182
01:29:03,760 --> 01:29:05,360
people thinking that

2183
01:29:05,360 --> 01:29:07,520
you know this is somewhere to

2184
01:29:07,520 --> 01:29:09,199
to um

2185
01:29:09,199 --> 01:29:11,199
uh buy from

2186
01:29:11,199 --> 01:29:13,280
gives you a little fake boost up

2187
01:29:13,280 --> 01:29:15,120
thinking that this is an area to buy

2188
01:29:15,120 --> 01:29:18,239
from and then runs it

2189
01:29:18,239 --> 01:29:20,320
so you know you you just gotta

2190
01:29:20,320 --> 01:29:22,080
consider that make sure you have

2191
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:24,880
structure involved first

2192
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:27,440
and after you deal with structure now

2193
01:29:27,440 --> 01:29:29,360
you look for the other things this is

2194
01:29:29,360 --> 01:29:31,760
why i don't you know come on and teach

2195
01:29:31,760 --> 01:29:34,000
people oh take take the seventy percent

2196
01:29:34,000 --> 01:29:35,600
of this take the sixty percent of this

2197
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:37,600
look get in right here and then get out

2198
01:29:37,600 --> 01:29:39,360
here you know like i want you to see it

2199
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,360
for yourself so when you begin to see it

2200
01:29:41,360 --> 01:29:44,320
for yourself it becomes a lot easier for

2201
01:29:44,320 --> 01:29:46,800
you to trade on your own

2202
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:48,400
on your own

2203
01:29:48,400 --> 01:29:49,920
you know you may not always have the

2204
01:29:49,920 --> 01:29:52,719
time to to come on stream i may not

2205
01:29:52,719 --> 01:29:54,800
always come on stream i may be traveling

2206
01:29:54,800 --> 01:29:56,080
you know but

2207
01:29:56,080 --> 01:29:57,520
these principles

2208
01:29:57,520 --> 01:29:59,280
they will help you

2209
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:00,480
you know they'll

2210
01:30:00,480 --> 01:30:03,040
shift your perspective you know

2211
01:30:03,040 --> 01:30:05,280
change the way that you do trade

2212
01:30:05,280 --> 01:30:07,920
so this happens everywhere

2213
01:30:07,920 --> 01:30:10,639
everywhere the little you know s and d

2214
01:30:10,639 --> 01:30:13,280
rejections the imbalance fills you know

2215
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:16,719
like all of this happens everywhere

2216
01:30:16,719 --> 01:30:19,840
and i you know want you guys to to

2217
01:30:19,840 --> 01:30:21,360
understand that

2218
01:30:21,360 --> 01:30:23,360
you know and this is why i teach what i

2219
01:30:23,360 --> 01:30:25,040
teach this is the this is why i teach

2220
01:30:25,040 --> 01:30:27,199
the way i teach i can trade any time of

2221
01:30:27,199 --> 01:30:30,000
the day if i wanted to if if six o'clock

2222
01:30:30,000 --> 01:30:32,000
sunday came i could start trading from

2223
01:30:32,000 --> 01:30:34,239
six o'clock sunday

2224
01:30:34,239 --> 01:30:36,400
i don't i don't have to wait

2225
01:30:36,400 --> 01:30:38,560
you're like oh spreads are high even if

2226
01:30:38,560 --> 01:30:40,719
the spreads are high

2227
01:30:40,719 --> 01:30:43,040
go to the higher time frame now

2228
01:30:43,040 --> 01:30:44,239
because the higher time frame is going

2229
01:30:44,239 --> 01:30:46,000
to give you more pips

2230
01:30:46,000 --> 01:30:48,080
and that would certainly clear the

2231
01:30:48,080 --> 01:30:50,239
spread if you're right about your

2232
01:30:50,239 --> 01:30:53,679
directional bias in that case

2233
01:30:54,159 --> 01:30:55,679
you know so

2234
01:30:55,679 --> 01:30:58,000
it's just you know some gems that you

2235
01:30:58,000 --> 01:31:00,000
guys uh

2236
01:31:00,000 --> 01:31:02,320
might want to consider

2237
01:31:02,320 --> 01:31:03,760
um

2238
01:31:03,760 --> 01:31:05,440
yeah

2239
01:31:05,440 --> 01:31:07,679
i feel like i'd be i'd be ranting to you

2240
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:08,880
guys

2241
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,679
they're like oh shut up and find a trade

2242
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:14,239
already

2243
01:31:15,199 --> 01:31:17,360
so as we mentioned with this area this

2244
01:31:17,360 --> 01:31:18,400
is

2245
01:31:18,400 --> 01:31:20,719
this is a pattern that you particularly

2246
01:31:20,719 --> 01:31:22,960
particularly see in price that

2247
01:31:22,960 --> 01:31:26,239
facilitates a shift up and only because

2248
01:31:26,239 --> 01:31:29,840
this oftentimes is wipe off on a lower

2249
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:31,199
time frame

2250
01:31:31,199 --> 01:31:33,760
so this is why i tell you guys to to

2251
01:31:33,760 --> 01:31:35,679
learn and study why golf because it'll

2252
01:31:35,679 --> 01:31:40,159
help you grasp my concepts way faster

2253
01:31:40,159 --> 01:31:42,080
way faster

2254
01:31:42,080 --> 01:31:44,159
because you're like it gives you an eye

2255
01:31:44,159 --> 01:31:47,120
now for it but you have to first learn

2256
01:31:47,120 --> 01:31:49,120
what everything is

2257
01:31:49,120 --> 01:31:50,800
you gotta first learn what everything

2258
01:31:50,800 --> 01:31:51,840
means

2259
01:31:51,840 --> 01:31:53,600
and when you learn that

2260
01:31:53,600 --> 01:31:55,760
then you're able to participate in the

2261
01:31:55,760 --> 01:31:58,719
market with that so i see this low put

2262
01:31:58,719 --> 01:32:01,360
in we have this high

2263
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:04,320
then we well first of all we had this

2264
01:32:04,320 --> 01:32:08,159
low put in with this one candle

2265
01:32:08,159 --> 01:32:09,920
if you were to just take the high and

2266
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,320
the low of this one candle this was

2267
01:32:12,320 --> 01:32:14,560
responsible for running a low

2268
01:32:14,560 --> 01:32:16,719
and taking out a high

2269
01:32:16,719 --> 01:32:19,360
so you know that price is going to if

2270
01:32:19,360 --> 01:32:22,400
price runs this high it's going to dip

2271
01:32:22,400 --> 01:32:25,520
back into the area before leaving

2272
01:32:25,520 --> 01:32:28,320
this is your first entry

2273
01:32:28,320 --> 01:32:31,040
fine this mitigates this area

2274
01:32:31,040 --> 01:32:32,800
you don't get in

2275
01:32:32,800 --> 01:32:34,800
because you know this area is mitigated

2276
01:32:34,800 --> 01:32:36,639
you didn't see it happen

2277
01:32:36,639 --> 01:32:39,199
you have another opportunity when price

2278
01:32:39,199 --> 01:32:42,080
trades higher to come back into this

2279
01:32:42,080 --> 01:32:43,280
area

2280
01:32:43,280 --> 01:32:45,199
take a trade from here

2281
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:47,360
then it goes

2282
01:32:47,360 --> 01:32:50,080
so it continues to go and again you look

2283
01:32:50,080 --> 01:32:52,080
you see where these rejections are

2284
01:32:52,080 --> 01:32:55,120
happening where the trend is building

2285
01:32:55,120 --> 01:32:57,040
these rejections are just building the

2286
01:32:57,040 --> 01:32:58,239
trend

2287
01:32:58,239 --> 01:32:59,440
so

2288
01:32:59,440 --> 01:33:00,880
you have

2289
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,760
price come into

2290
01:33:04,480 --> 01:33:07,840
now this area is making lower lows i

2291
01:33:07,840 --> 01:33:09,600
mean higher high higher highs higher

2292
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:10,880
lows

2293
01:33:10,880 --> 01:33:12,239
higher low here

2294
01:33:12,239 --> 01:33:14,960
we break up above to this area but what

2295
01:33:14,960 --> 01:33:16,000
do we do

2296
01:33:16,000 --> 01:33:18,960
we tap back into this area before

2297
01:33:18,960 --> 01:33:20,480
trading higher

2298
01:33:20,480 --> 01:33:22,239
and this is why i said when these wicks

2299
01:33:22,239 --> 01:33:24,560
come out of the area that you're looking

2300
01:33:24,560 --> 01:33:27,760
to trade from that's okay

2301
01:33:27,760 --> 01:33:30,400
this is just called absorption

2302
01:33:30,400 --> 01:33:32,880
this is what i tell you guys study

2303
01:33:32,880 --> 01:33:34,880
along with white golf

2304
01:33:34,880 --> 01:33:37,520
study absorption

2305
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:39,679
study displacement

2306
01:33:39,679 --> 01:33:40,960
and

2307
01:33:40,960 --> 01:33:42,800
there was another one that i had

2308
01:33:42,800 --> 01:33:44,080
mentioned

2309
01:33:44,080 --> 01:33:46,080
imbalances look at how could i forget

2310
01:33:46,080 --> 01:33:46,880
that

2311
01:33:46,880 --> 01:33:48,639
study absorption study displacement

2312
01:33:48,639 --> 01:33:50,080
study balances there's a little

2313
01:33:50,080 --> 01:33:52,719
imbalance in between here

2314
01:33:52,719 --> 01:33:54,239
not sure if price would just tap into

2315
01:33:54,239 --> 01:33:55,920
this area and go let's have intense

2316
01:33:55,920 --> 01:33:57,679
imbalance and then leave

2317
01:33:57,679 --> 01:33:59,679
probably tap back up into this area and

2318
01:33:59,679 --> 01:34:03,440
then short maybe from it not too sure

2319
01:34:03,440 --> 01:34:07,199
um but it is a possibility

2320
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:12,080
so there are times where price doesn't

2321
01:34:12,080 --> 01:34:14,400
tap into the 50 of the imbalance

2322
01:34:14,400 --> 01:34:16,320
sometimes you tap a little higher

2323
01:34:16,320 --> 01:34:18,080
sometimes it'll just leave that's a

2324
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:19,840
possibility too

2325
01:34:19,840 --> 01:34:21,760
yeah inefficiencies and efficiencies

2326
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,320
that's exactly it

2327
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,719
so study those three things

2328
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,360
along with wyckoff oh my gosh your

2329
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:32,159
trading would go to like the next level

2330
01:34:32,159 --> 01:34:34,239
those three things will wipe off

2331
01:34:34,239 --> 01:34:35,360
next

2332
01:34:35,360 --> 01:34:36,880
level and i get it it's going to take

2333
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:39,040
some time to learn those things it will

2334
01:34:39,040 --> 01:34:40,960
i mean it took some time for me

2335
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,280
you know to to catch on some of it was

2336
01:34:43,280 --> 01:34:45,360
difficult i felt like wyckoff was just

2337
01:34:45,360 --> 01:34:46,560
like

2338
01:34:46,560 --> 01:34:50,400
burning my my eyes and brain cells like

2339
01:34:50,400 --> 01:34:53,760
oh my gosh it was

2340
01:34:53,760 --> 01:34:55,360
gruesome

2341
01:34:55,360 --> 01:34:56,880
but

2342
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,600
you know again i was able to

2343
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,199
learn a little something from it and

2344
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:03,760
build on top of it i don't expect people

2345
01:35:03,760 --> 01:35:05,760
to trade the same way i do yeah there

2346
01:35:05,760 --> 01:35:07,840
might be people that have the desire to

2347
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:09,840
you know trade the same exact way that i

2348
01:35:09,840 --> 01:35:12,080
do um but

2349
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,159
you can take this trading and turn this

2350
01:35:14,159 --> 01:35:18,159
into like some next level stuff you know

2351
01:35:18,159 --> 01:35:20,239
i can act like i'm the best trader now

2352
01:35:20,239 --> 01:35:21,679
and later on you could stomp me out

2353
01:35:21,679 --> 01:35:23,600
after learning you know

2354
01:35:23,600 --> 01:35:25,280
like all of the people all of the groups

2355
01:35:25,280 --> 01:35:26,560
that i joined

2356
01:35:26,560 --> 01:35:29,280
i watched how fast i progressed

2357
01:35:29,280 --> 01:35:32,320
above them like like a lot faster than

2358
01:35:32,320 --> 01:35:36,239
they did and it was simply because um

2359
01:35:36,239 --> 01:35:37,840
you know like they

2360
01:35:37,840 --> 01:35:40,320
they topped out at learning they learned

2361
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:42,480
one particular

2362
01:35:42,480 --> 01:35:43,760
trading style

2363
01:35:43,760 --> 01:35:46,400
and they kept at it with that

2364
01:35:46,400 --> 01:35:48,239
nothing else they they didn't feel a

2365
01:35:48,239 --> 01:35:50,480
need to to learn anything else watch

2366
01:35:50,480 --> 01:35:53,040
this um smd up here they didn't feel a

2367
01:35:53,040 --> 01:35:55,040
need to learn anything else

2368
01:35:55,040 --> 01:35:57,280
and they're fine with trading with their

2369
01:35:57,280 --> 01:35:58,560
style as their system they're going to

2370
01:35:58,560 --> 01:36:00,560
do it over and over again

2371
01:36:00,560 --> 01:36:03,119
all of this stuff that i teach you guys

2372
01:36:03,119 --> 01:36:05,679
are from so many different trading

2373
01:36:05,679 --> 01:36:07,840
styles that i've seen and been exposed

2374
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,760
to but i'm like yeah that's cool but

2375
01:36:09,760 --> 01:36:12,159
that could be better you know and then i

2376
01:36:12,159 --> 01:36:13,840
find a way to make it better there's

2377
01:36:13,840 --> 01:36:16,000
this guy on youtube called

2378
01:36:16,000 --> 01:36:17,600
joshua wiseman

2379
01:36:17,600 --> 01:36:20,800
he makes all of the um

2380
01:36:20,800 --> 01:36:22,800
all of the fast foods actually let me

2381
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,960
let me show you guys

2382
01:36:24,960 --> 01:36:26,000
yeah

2383
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,520
just give you guys a look at this

2384
01:36:30,639 --> 01:36:32,880
um

2385
01:36:35,119 --> 01:36:36,960
yeah right here look at his first guy

2386
01:36:36,960 --> 01:36:39,199
here

2387
01:36:39,199 --> 01:36:43,360
so he makes all of the different um

2388
01:36:43,360 --> 01:36:45,119
fast foods

2389
01:36:45,119 --> 01:36:47,920
um but he has a

2390
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,560
section called butt better so he he

2391
01:36:50,560 --> 01:36:52,880
shows how to make you know good food for

2392
01:36:52,880 --> 01:36:55,119
for cheap as well but he makes a bunch

2393
01:36:55,119 --> 01:36:57,119
of things you know like um

2394
01:36:57,119 --> 01:36:59,760
the obviously you see snickers here you

2395
01:36:59,760 --> 01:37:02,560
know girl scout cookies he's making like

2396
01:37:02,560 --> 01:37:05,840
he's making different types of food um

2397
01:37:05,840 --> 01:37:07,840
and he's showing you what

2398
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:09,760
it could cost in a restaurant versus

2399
01:37:09,760 --> 01:37:12,800
what he he does with four dollars

2400
01:37:12,800 --> 01:37:15,679
you know like and it's healthier options

2401
01:37:15,679 --> 01:37:17,600
but this guy he makes everything and he

2402
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,480
has a section called but better

2403
01:37:20,480 --> 01:37:23,360
so he takes whatever it is that he's

2404
01:37:23,360 --> 01:37:25,040
he's learned

2405
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,880
you know from from these fast food

2406
01:37:26,880 --> 01:37:29,199
chains and he makes it

2407
01:37:29,199 --> 01:37:31,280
in a better fashion

2408
01:37:31,280 --> 01:37:33,440
you know or or healthier ingredients or

2409
01:37:33,440 --> 01:37:35,280
even the taste is better

2410
01:37:35,280 --> 01:37:36,880
so um

2411
01:37:36,880 --> 01:37:38,719
you know like that that's something this

2412
01:37:38,719 --> 01:37:40,239
could be coming to feel this imbalance

2413
01:37:40,239 --> 01:37:41,199
here

2414
01:37:41,199 --> 01:37:43,920
or tap further into the s d zone but

2415
01:37:43,920 --> 01:37:46,800
yeah he he has this section called but

2416
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,480
better and

2417
01:37:48,480 --> 01:37:50,719
the food is really

2418
01:37:50,719 --> 01:37:53,920
really a lot better than

2419
01:37:53,920 --> 01:37:56,239
than i've ever seen it anywhere you know

2420
01:37:56,239 --> 01:37:58,159
um yeah so this could have been the tap

2421
01:37:58,159 --> 01:37:59,360
here

2422
01:37:59,360 --> 01:38:01,119
um

2423
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:03,840
here maybe

2424
01:38:04,480 --> 01:38:05,760
yeah this could have been the tab here

2425
01:38:05,760 --> 01:38:08,000
to send it up to one of these smds here

2426
01:38:08,000 --> 01:38:09,920
or here

2427
01:38:09,920 --> 01:38:11,440
but this was also

2428
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:15,800
coming up the imbalance as well

2429
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:17,679
yeah that that's kind of what i want to

2430
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:18,960
do i want to like

2431
01:38:18,960 --> 01:38:20,400
watch other people's styles and

2432
01:38:20,400 --> 01:38:23,360
techniques and then make it better you

2433
01:38:23,360 --> 01:38:26,000
know like it it doesn't have to be

2434
01:38:26,000 --> 01:38:28,400
complicated it just has to have

2435
01:38:28,400 --> 01:38:30,239
structure involved and that's why i tell

2436
01:38:30,239 --> 01:38:31,760
people i don't trade with indicators i

2437
01:38:31,760 --> 01:38:33,760
don't like and i try to get people to

2438
01:38:33,760 --> 01:38:35,520
ditch it too because like i said if

2439
01:38:35,520 --> 01:38:37,760
trade and view went down one day

2440
01:38:37,760 --> 01:38:39,679
and you had access to no indicators and

2441
01:38:39,679 --> 01:38:41,679
you're in a trade you're stuck

2442
01:38:41,679 --> 01:38:43,520
you know like that's all it takes is for

2443
01:38:43,520 --> 01:38:45,679
a billionaire to buy trading view and

2444
01:38:45,679 --> 01:38:47,920
glitch the indicators one day or a

2445
01:38:47,920 --> 01:38:50,400
couple of days you know oh our servers

2446
01:38:50,400 --> 01:38:53,600
are down sorry you know

2447
01:38:53,600 --> 01:38:56,840
and everybody's caught out there

2448
01:38:56,840 --> 01:38:59,600
so you know you guys just want to make

2449
01:38:59,600 --> 01:39:00,530
sure you um

2450
01:39:00,530 --> 01:39:02,560
[Music]

2451
01:39:02,560 --> 01:39:04,560
you know you you insulate yourself in

2452
01:39:04,560 --> 01:39:06,560
that ways by learning the skill without

2453
01:39:06,560 --> 01:39:07,920
having to

2454
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:09,760
be guided by

2455
01:39:09,760 --> 01:39:11,840
you know like this could be feeling this

2456
01:39:11,840 --> 01:39:14,639
imbalance possibly or coming back down

2457
01:39:14,639 --> 01:39:16,480
to the snd down here

2458
01:39:16,480 --> 01:39:17,600
um

2459
01:39:17,600 --> 01:39:19,760
you know just just learning

2460
01:39:19,760 --> 01:39:22,159
you know learning it and and not needing

2461
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:23,440
anything

2462
01:39:23,440 --> 01:39:25,360
you know to see it or to do it you're

2463
01:39:25,360 --> 01:39:28,080
far ahead of so many people within the

2464
01:39:28,080 --> 01:39:29,520
industry

2465
01:39:29,520 --> 01:39:31,760
far ahead there's only a couple people

2466
01:39:31,760 --> 01:39:34,159
that i know don't use indicators at all

2467
01:39:34,159 --> 01:39:35,119
um

2468
01:39:35,119 --> 01:39:36,560
and i'm not saying that they're the best

2469
01:39:36,560 --> 01:39:39,520
traders in the world you know but

2470
01:39:39,520 --> 01:39:41,760
they've gotten their system in a way

2471
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:42,560
where

2472
01:39:42,560 --> 01:39:44,880
they don't need to use it because they

2473
01:39:44,880 --> 01:39:47,360
just read price now do they reprice the

2474
01:39:47,360 --> 01:39:49,119
same way i do no

2475
01:39:49,119 --> 01:39:49,920
but

2476
01:39:49,920 --> 01:39:51,920
it's it's sufficient

2477
01:39:51,920 --> 01:39:52,880
you know

2478
01:39:52,880 --> 01:39:55,679
like it it makes them profitable

2479
01:39:55,679 --> 01:39:58,480
like um uh raja banks

2480
01:39:58,480 --> 01:40:01,440
you know wix don't lie he uses the wicks

2481
01:40:01,440 --> 01:40:03,040
in a way where

2482
01:40:03,040 --> 01:40:05,360
you know like he was able to

2483
01:40:05,360 --> 01:40:07,520
take his account from 50 000 to 2

2484
01:40:07,520 --> 01:40:09,920
million in one year

2485
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:13,520
that's remarkable that's impressive

2486
01:40:13,520 --> 01:40:15,040
um that and

2487
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:17,280
that happens people can do that

2488
01:40:17,280 --> 01:40:19,920
um it's very very possible

2489
01:40:19,920 --> 01:40:21,280
um

2490
01:40:21,280 --> 01:40:22,880
but

2491
01:40:22,880 --> 01:40:25,520
you got to have the skill to do it

2492
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,520
your skill has to meet

2493
01:40:27,520 --> 01:40:31,440
you know like whatever it is that that

2494
01:40:31,440 --> 01:40:33,600
so this line was for the imbalance guys

2495
01:40:33,600 --> 01:40:36,320
by the way this this line is not here

2496
01:40:36,320 --> 01:40:39,840
for anything other than the imbalance

2497
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:46,400
yeah um yeah so you know

2498
01:40:46,560 --> 01:40:49,520
he he makes a ton of money you know like

2499
01:40:49,520 --> 01:40:51,360
utilizing wicks

2500
01:40:51,360 --> 01:40:52,639
and

2501
01:40:52,639 --> 01:40:54,159
and that's amazing that's cool that's

2502
01:40:54,159 --> 01:40:56,000
his trading style he has the same

2503
01:40:56,000 --> 01:40:57,920
discipline does it every day

2504
01:40:57,920 --> 01:40:59,840
um regardless of

2505
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:02,239
whatever his personality might be to

2506
01:41:02,239 --> 01:41:04,719
some people um

2507
01:41:04,719 --> 01:41:06,880
he teaches these things and and other

2508
01:41:06,880 --> 01:41:08,719
people learn from him you know there's

2509
01:41:08,719 --> 01:41:12,800
other um traitors other streamers who

2510
01:41:12,800 --> 01:41:15,280
utilizes his techniques while streaming

2511
01:41:15,280 --> 01:41:16,960
i mean i think he's a little upset that

2512
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:18,480
they don't really give him credit but

2513
01:41:18,480 --> 01:41:19,920
you know there's other streamers that

2514
01:41:19,920 --> 01:41:21,280
utilize that

2515
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:22,800
and sorry guys i was just pulling

2516
01:41:22,800 --> 01:41:23,679
something out of my head so

2517
01:41:23,679 --> 01:41:25,280
unprofessional right

2518
01:41:25,280 --> 01:41:27,199
i don't care opted out of society a long

2519
01:41:27,199 --> 01:41:29,280
time ago

2520
01:41:29,280 --> 01:41:30,320
so

2521
01:41:30,320 --> 01:41:32,000
yeah you know watch this in balance here

2522
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,000
guys it could feel the imbalance or

2523
01:41:34,000 --> 01:41:36,159
possibly um

2524
01:41:36,159 --> 01:41:38,159
tap into the s and d or you can just

2525
01:41:38,159 --> 01:41:39,520
leave it in balance there and continue

2526
01:41:39,520 --> 01:41:42,080
to trade away

2527
01:41:43,520 --> 01:41:47,119
yes exactly raja he he'd be tearing some

2528
01:41:47,119 --> 01:41:49,920
of those people up i'm like oh yikes you

2529
01:41:49,920 --> 01:41:51,760
know he's

2530
01:41:51,760 --> 01:41:54,400
and him and him his little uh

2531
01:41:54,400 --> 01:41:56,320
war with daniel savage i don't know what

2532
01:41:56,320 --> 01:41:59,360
that's about but they

2533
01:41:59,360 --> 01:42:01,280
they gotta hug it out or something i

2534
01:42:01,280 --> 01:42:03,520
don't

2535
01:42:03,600 --> 01:42:07,600
he sounds like he hates that man

2536
01:42:07,600 --> 01:42:09,280
so yeah you know like

2537
01:42:09,280 --> 01:42:10,719
like you have some of these streamers

2538
01:42:10,719 --> 01:42:12,080
who like

2539
01:42:12,080 --> 01:42:13,600
they they do great things with their

2540
01:42:13,600 --> 01:42:15,600
trading um they're very profitable with

2541
01:42:15,600 --> 01:42:16,719
their trades then you have other

2542
01:42:16,719 --> 01:42:18,960
streamers who don't take trades at all

2543
01:42:18,960 --> 01:42:21,040
like i didn't i didn't find a trade

2544
01:42:21,040 --> 01:42:22,880
today didn't find a setup whatever it is

2545
01:42:22,880 --> 01:42:25,040
and it's like

2546
01:42:25,040 --> 01:42:28,480
what yeah

2547
01:42:28,480 --> 01:42:31,119
the amount of pears and stuff that you

2548
01:42:31,119 --> 01:42:32,719
can trade in general even if it was

2549
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:34,080
exotics

2550
01:42:34,080 --> 01:42:36,320
i would go to mexico new zealand right

2551
01:42:36,320 --> 01:42:38,560
now if or somebody give me an exotic

2552
01:42:38,560 --> 01:42:40,560
pair i can go on that

2553
01:42:40,560 --> 01:42:42,239
and just trade an exotic pill like

2554
01:42:42,239 --> 01:42:44,000
something that people don't trade

2555
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:45,920
something super high spreads maybe or

2556
01:42:45,920 --> 01:42:48,480
whatever it is like i could i could do

2557
01:42:48,480 --> 01:42:49,360
that

2558
01:42:49,360 --> 01:42:51,199
you know whatever it is anything it

2559
01:42:51,199 --> 01:42:54,080
doesn't matter it's the same stuff over

2560
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:55,760
and over in every single market you see

2561
01:42:55,760 --> 01:42:58,000
what i said we can probably try to fill

2562
01:42:58,000 --> 01:42:59,520
the imbalance but if not we just have a

2563
01:42:59,520 --> 01:43:01,679
continuation down

2564
01:43:01,679 --> 01:43:03,920
so there's a continuation down

2565
01:43:03,920 --> 01:43:04,960
um

2566
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:06,560
we want to make sure we're not going to

2567
01:43:06,560 --> 01:43:08,480
tap into this

2568
01:43:08,480 --> 01:43:11,679
and then head back up

2569
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:13,600
to let me see

2570
01:43:13,600 --> 01:43:15,119
yeah here just want to make sure we're

2571
01:43:15,119 --> 01:43:16,400
not

2572
01:43:16,400 --> 01:43:18,560
doing this and we should be coming below

2573
01:43:18,560 --> 01:43:20,239
this

2574
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:24,320
hopefully actually wait

2575
01:43:24,320 --> 01:43:26,320
yeah so see when when these zones start

2576
01:43:26,320 --> 01:43:28,639
to get cleared and there's no reaction

2577
01:43:28,639 --> 01:43:31,440
from them then it gives me some sort of

2578
01:43:31,440 --> 01:43:33,920
confidence that we're continuing down

2579
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:35,360
but you see this

2580
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,119
had a reaction to the middle of the zone

2581
01:43:37,119 --> 01:43:38,400
that's why i kept

2582
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:41,440
you know trailing it from here to here

2583
01:43:41,440 --> 01:43:44,560
to here and you just begin to watch this

2584
01:43:44,560 --> 01:43:46,320
and see what happens within this area

2585
01:43:46,320 --> 01:43:47,840
you know when we when we tap into

2586
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:50,000
certain zones

2587
01:43:50,000 --> 01:43:51,199
usually we want to see some

2588
01:43:51,199 --> 01:43:53,600
consolidation going sideways

2589
01:43:53,600 --> 01:43:56,080
to kind of give us an idea that

2590
01:43:56,080 --> 01:43:58,719
we could potentially push off of this

2591
01:43:58,719 --> 01:44:01,600
area but even with this zone look we're

2592
01:44:01,600 --> 01:44:03,119
establishing

2593
01:44:03,119 --> 01:44:04,639
equal lows

2594
01:44:04,639 --> 01:44:06,320
here

2595
01:44:06,320 --> 01:44:08,239
which we could potentially come back up

2596
01:44:08,239 --> 01:44:10,560
into this and balance then run or come

2597
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:12,639
back up into this s well this imbalance

2598
01:44:12,639 --> 01:44:15,600
s and d imbalance s and d

2599
01:44:15,600 --> 01:44:18,239
and s and d here so you see

2600
01:44:18,239 --> 01:44:21,199
all of this here you know

2601
01:44:21,199 --> 01:44:24,560
this is unmitigated this whole area

2602
01:44:24,560 --> 01:44:27,360
is is unmitigated within here maybe even

2603
01:44:27,360 --> 01:44:28,800
on a higher timeframe you might see that

2604
01:44:28,800 --> 01:44:30,880
it's unmitigated from there too

2605
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:32,320
um

2606
01:44:32,320 --> 01:44:34,800
but yeah this you know we we just begin

2607
01:44:34,800 --> 01:44:36,960
to look at what what happens around this

2608
01:44:36,960 --> 01:44:38,000
area

2609
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:39,280
and when we

2610
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:41,119
you know kind of get an idea of what's

2611
01:44:41,119 --> 01:44:42,719
happening around here we know that if we

2612
01:44:42,719 --> 01:44:44,560
were shorting from up here we could

2613
01:44:44,560 --> 01:44:46,320
possibly get out of a short because it

2614
01:44:46,320 --> 01:44:48,639
might take us back here

2615
01:44:48,639 --> 01:44:50,000
but

2616
01:44:50,000 --> 01:44:52,480
what this can honestly do is come back

2617
01:44:52,480 --> 01:44:54,960
up to this area and tap a second time

2618
01:44:54,960 --> 01:44:56,960
too and have a second rejection from

2619
01:44:56,960 --> 01:44:58,159
this area

2620
01:44:58,159 --> 01:44:59,760
because we didn't consolidate in this

2621
01:44:59,760 --> 01:45:01,679
area we came and tapped into this area

2622
01:45:01,679 --> 01:45:03,600
and left immediately

2623
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:05,840
so there could also be

2624
01:45:05,840 --> 01:45:08,560
a tap back into the area at a later time

2625
01:45:08,560 --> 01:45:10,159
maybe it can like go down to this

2626
01:45:10,159 --> 01:45:12,080
imbalance here or somewhere within an

2627
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:15,199
area here head back up within this area

2628
01:45:15,199 --> 01:45:16,639
and then

2629
01:45:16,639 --> 01:45:19,920
you know push further away um but that's

2630
01:45:19,920 --> 01:45:21,760
why we just watch price and we just look

2631
01:45:21,760 --> 01:45:23,760
at what price does

2632
01:45:23,760 --> 01:45:25,440
and and

2633
01:45:25,440 --> 01:45:27,360
we just move off of that we just make

2634
01:45:27,360 --> 01:45:29,840
decisions based on that remember um uh

2635
01:45:29,840 --> 01:45:32,880
armani i told you about the the stab

2636
01:45:32,880 --> 01:45:34,000
that's here

2637
01:45:34,000 --> 01:45:35,360
remember i said watch how it happens on

2638
01:45:35,360 --> 01:45:37,760
the upside too you see that i tell you

2639
01:45:37,760 --> 01:45:39,199
look like head and shoulders patterns

2640
01:45:39,199 --> 01:45:41,760
almost you know that the people are

2641
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,520
you know hypothesizing but oftentimes

2642
01:45:43,520 --> 01:45:45,920
it's just wipe off

2643
01:45:45,920 --> 01:45:48,639
just distribution happening oftentimes

2644
01:45:48,639 --> 01:45:51,199
so accumulation distribution you can

2645
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:52,960
come down here accumulate again it can

2646
01:45:52,960 --> 01:45:54,480
distribute up here it can accumulate

2647
01:45:54,480 --> 01:45:56,000
again down here like when you're paying

2648
01:45:56,000 --> 01:45:57,440
attention to these things it helps you

2649
01:45:57,440 --> 01:45:58,800
to be able to

2650
01:45:58,800 --> 01:46:01,360
scalp a little more but for me you know

2651
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,360
i pretty much

2652
01:46:03,360 --> 01:46:04,320
you know

2653
01:46:04,320 --> 01:46:06,880
utilize these things in passing just

2654
01:46:06,880 --> 01:46:09,760
like i'm aware of something

2655
01:46:09,760 --> 01:46:12,080
but i'm not actually

2656
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,239
like using it to trade

2657
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:15,520
you know

2658
01:46:15,520 --> 01:46:18,960
i'm i'm just more so using it to

2659
01:46:18,960 --> 01:46:21,920
um you know like look this here

2660
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:23,600
this could be the

2661
01:46:23,600 --> 01:46:25,280
the ar

2662
01:46:25,280 --> 01:46:27,920
ar here selling climax here secondary

2663
01:46:27,920 --> 01:46:30,800
test here sign of weakness

2664
01:46:30,800 --> 01:46:32,560
then we could have the ut

2665
01:46:32,560 --> 01:46:35,600
we could have the utah here

2666
01:46:35,600 --> 01:46:37,360
we could have a test of the utad or we

2667
01:46:37,360 --> 01:46:39,520
could have a push back up and test the

2668
01:46:39,520 --> 01:46:40,800
utad

2669
01:46:40,800 --> 01:46:44,159
before continuing down to these areas

2670
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:46,560
that could be a possibility

2671
01:46:46,560 --> 01:46:48,159
you know and

2672
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:50,800
that's just understanding

2673
01:46:50,800 --> 01:46:53,520
you know wyckoff

2674
01:46:53,520 --> 01:46:54,400
now

2675
01:46:54,400 --> 01:46:56,480
the way that i trade again i don't use

2676
01:46:56,480 --> 01:46:59,440
that you know i use more like a more

2677
01:46:59,440 --> 01:47:00,719
powerful

2678
01:47:00,719 --> 01:47:03,280
way of trading a more simplistic i i

2679
01:47:03,280 --> 01:47:04,320
would say

2680
01:47:04,320 --> 01:47:05,840
way of trading

2681
01:47:05,840 --> 01:47:07,119
um

2682
01:47:07,119 --> 01:47:08,800
so i don't

2683
01:47:08,800 --> 01:47:11,119
you know it was it was born out of white

2684
01:47:11,119 --> 01:47:12,480
golf

2685
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,239
so this is why i continue to say that

2686
01:47:14,239 --> 01:47:17,040
like this is why golf i am using white

2687
01:47:17,040 --> 01:47:20,639
golf but i'm not using it the way

2688
01:47:20,639 --> 01:47:22,400
people use i'm not using the way people

2689
01:47:22,400 --> 01:47:23,840
teach it

2690
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,320
it's it's like an entirely different way

2691
01:47:26,320 --> 01:47:28,560
so look this is the low here

2692
01:47:28,560 --> 01:47:30,000
right here

2693
01:47:30,000 --> 01:47:31,520
this is the low

2694
01:47:31,520 --> 01:47:34,239
and this is the high so we're in between

2695
01:47:34,239 --> 01:47:35,840
these two areas

2696
01:47:35,840 --> 01:47:37,520
right here

2697
01:47:37,520 --> 01:47:39,520
so this is a protected low

2698
01:47:39,520 --> 01:47:40,719
this is

2699
01:47:40,719 --> 01:47:42,719
a high that they

2700
01:47:42,719 --> 01:47:45,600
they just put in

2701
01:47:46,080 --> 01:47:47,920
so

2702
01:47:47,920 --> 01:47:48,800
with

2703
01:47:48,800 --> 01:47:51,119
if you look at this with um there's

2704
01:47:51,119 --> 01:47:52,639
there's different types of structure

2705
01:47:52,639 --> 01:47:54,719
here

2706
01:47:54,719 --> 01:47:56,480
this top here

2707
01:47:56,480 --> 01:47:57,679
up here

2708
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,280
down here

2709
01:47:59,280 --> 01:48:00,400
up here

2710
01:48:00,400 --> 01:48:01,280
down

2711
01:48:01,280 --> 01:48:02,800
up

2712
01:48:02,800 --> 01:48:06,880
and then what do we get a run of it

2713
01:48:06,880 --> 01:48:09,520
after we get a run of it what do we get

2714
01:48:09,520 --> 01:48:12,320
a tap up into the area

2715
01:48:12,320 --> 01:48:15,280
but this tap may not be sufficient it

2716
01:48:15,280 --> 01:48:17,679
may come further into this area like

2717
01:48:17,679 --> 01:48:19,280
through here

2718
01:48:19,280 --> 01:48:21,440
you know so so we get this tap we trade

2719
01:48:21,440 --> 01:48:22,639
back down

2720
01:48:22,639 --> 01:48:24,960
we didn't run this high i mean this low

2721
01:48:24,960 --> 01:48:26,880
sorry or this high

2722
01:48:26,880 --> 01:48:28,080
because these

2723
01:48:28,080 --> 01:48:30,080
according to like the structure that is

2724
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:31,679
creating

2725
01:48:31,679 --> 01:48:34,239
these this is the important low and this

2726
01:48:34,239 --> 01:48:37,119
is the important high everything else

2727
01:48:37,119 --> 01:48:38,960
is lunch meat

2728
01:48:38,960 --> 01:48:41,360
everything else in here between this and

2729
01:48:41,360 --> 01:48:42,239
this

2730
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,000
all lunch meat

2731
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:47,280
all you got is new people coming into

2732
01:48:47,280 --> 01:48:49,360
the market and just jumping in trying to

2733
01:48:49,360 --> 01:48:51,360
take trades you know

2734
01:48:51,360 --> 01:48:52,400
people that don't know what they're

2735
01:48:52,400 --> 01:48:53,360
doing

2736
01:48:53,360 --> 01:48:56,000
trading within these areas and not

2737
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,760
really understanding

2738
01:48:57,760 --> 01:48:59,600
you know what they mean

2739
01:48:59,600 --> 01:49:01,360
not really understanding

2740
01:49:01,360 --> 01:49:03,040
you know that

2741
01:49:03,040 --> 01:49:06,480
these areas are specifically put in

2742
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,000
by

2743
01:49:08,000 --> 01:49:10,480
the ones who control the market

2744
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:12,880
and if they're ran then it gives you an

2745
01:49:12,880 --> 01:49:14,639
indication of

2746
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,960
what could potentially happen

2747
01:49:16,960 --> 01:49:19,440
after they ran

2748
01:49:19,440 --> 01:49:21,920
you know so

2749
01:49:21,920 --> 01:49:22,719
yeah

2750
01:49:22,719 --> 01:49:25,360
and you want body closures below

2751
01:49:25,360 --> 01:49:27,040
because wix can

2752
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,840
can fake you out

2753
01:49:31,360 --> 01:49:32,960
and you see

2754
01:49:32,960 --> 01:49:34,840
you see what i said here

2755
01:49:34,840 --> 01:49:36,480
[Music]

2756
01:49:36,480 --> 01:49:38,159
i said we can come right back up into

2757
01:49:38,159 --> 01:49:40,639
this imbalance

2758
01:49:40,639 --> 01:49:42,560
potentially reject the way and continue

2759
01:49:42,560 --> 01:49:43,920
down

2760
01:49:43,920 --> 01:49:45,440
look at that right back up into the

2761
01:49:45,440 --> 01:49:46,639
imbalance

2762
01:49:46,639 --> 01:49:49,520
reject it away continue down

2763
01:49:49,520 --> 01:49:51,599
it's it's like

2764
01:49:51,599 --> 01:49:54,000
it's so repetitive it happens over and

2765
01:49:54,000 --> 01:49:56,960
over and over again like you know i i

2766
01:49:56,960 --> 01:49:59,360
don't know

2767
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:01,760
i don't know if

2768
01:50:01,760 --> 01:50:04,400
i if if i saw something that was short i

2769
01:50:04,400 --> 01:50:06,719
would jump on it you know

2770
01:50:06,719 --> 01:50:09,520
like i would try to expose myself to it

2771
01:50:09,520 --> 01:50:10,800
so

2772
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,400
much

2773
01:50:12,400 --> 01:50:14,000
that

2774
01:50:14,000 --> 01:50:15,280
you know like i

2775
01:50:15,280 --> 01:50:17,040
i just want to learn it i just want to

2776
01:50:17,040 --> 01:50:18,719
know it

2777
01:50:18,719 --> 01:50:21,679
you know and that's what i would

2778
01:50:21,679 --> 01:50:23,760
essentially be looking to

2779
01:50:23,760 --> 01:50:26,000
to utilize am i trading

2780
01:50:26,000 --> 01:50:27,440
you know whether it's using certain

2781
01:50:27,440 --> 01:50:30,719
zones for scalping so with

2782
01:50:30,719 --> 01:50:32,239
with fractals

2783
01:50:32,239 --> 01:50:35,199
sometimes i use fractals for scalping

2784
01:50:35,199 --> 01:50:37,520
sometimes fractals can end up being a

2785
01:50:37,520 --> 01:50:40,400
more long-term thing so look

2786
01:50:40,400 --> 01:50:43,520
this touches the line on a fractal

2787
01:50:43,520 --> 01:50:46,719
you get a reaction up 19 pips

2788
01:50:46,719 --> 01:50:50,400
reaction just off the touch of it bam

2789
01:50:50,400 --> 01:50:53,040
and once that happens

2790
01:50:53,040 --> 01:50:55,199
jump out with 19 pips i told you guys

2791
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:58,320
all i need is 24

2792
01:50:58,320 --> 01:51:02,239
pips for the week 24.

2793
01:51:02,239 --> 01:51:04,960
do you see how easy it is to catch

2794
01:51:04,960 --> 01:51:06,910
24 each and every trade

2795
01:51:06,910 --> 01:51:08,320
[Music]

2796
01:51:08,320 --> 01:51:10,560
each and every trade

2797
01:51:10,560 --> 01:51:14,080
this like i don't know like

2798
01:51:14,800 --> 01:51:18,000
12 13 14 opportunities per stream what

volume is low yeah yeah volume is

2840
01:52:50,560 --> 01:52:52,639
definitely low um

2841
01:52:52,639 --> 01:52:54,159
it could be fridays

2842
01:52:54,159 --> 01:52:56,400
friday's usually a thing but i mean even

2843
01:52:56,400 --> 01:52:58,400
even with low volume like

2844
01:52:58,400 --> 01:53:00,800
price still goes i tell people this all

2845
01:53:00,800 --> 01:53:02,320
the time price still goes where it's

2846
01:53:02,320 --> 01:53:04,159
going you know whether this volume or

2847
01:53:04,159 --> 01:53:04,960
not

2848
01:53:04,960 --> 01:53:07,840
um the volume just speeds it up you know

2849
01:53:07,840 --> 01:53:09,199
to get there

2850
01:53:09,199 --> 01:53:12,239
you know so look at look at this um

2851
01:53:12,239 --> 01:53:15,599
look at this imbalance here

2852
01:53:16,080 --> 01:53:18,320
come on i feel like i feel like a broken

2853
01:53:18,320 --> 01:53:19,679
record when

2854
01:53:19,679 --> 01:53:22,080
whenever it is that i'm talking

2855
01:53:22,080 --> 01:53:23,679
you know because it's just the same

2856
01:53:23,679 --> 01:53:26,480
thing that happens over and over again

2857
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:30,159
look at that my weekly salary

2858
01:53:30,159 --> 01:53:33,280
in one candle

2859
01:53:35,119 --> 01:53:38,560
oh my mic was low damn

2860
01:53:38,560 --> 01:53:41,840
oh my god

2861
01:53:42,560 --> 01:53:44,560
i did not know that i did not know that

2862
01:53:44,560 --> 01:53:48,239
i gotta do that take all over again

2863
01:53:48,239 --> 01:53:51,040
this could change your lives guys

2864
01:53:51,040 --> 01:53:53,280

you guys to understand change your lives

2867
01:53:57,040 --> 01:53:58,080
forever

2868
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,520
look at another imbalance fill and

2869
01:53:59,520 --> 01:54:01,440
balance feel here and balance feel here

2870
01:54:01,440 --> 01:54:03,040
like

2871
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,599
even if it did not come up here

2872
01:54:05,599 --> 01:54:08,480
always look for a reaction at the first

2873
01:54:08,480 --> 01:54:10,080
imbalance that's something that i

2874
01:54:10,080 --> 01:54:11,679
learned from ict

2875
01:54:11,679 --> 01:54:14,239
always look for that um when is the

2876
01:54:14,239 --> 01:54:16,080
discord going to be up bro

2877
01:54:16,080 --> 01:54:19,360
john is really working very very hard on

2878
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:22,560
this there's actually some um components

2879
01:54:22,560 --> 01:54:25,119
actually that um

2880
01:54:25,119 --> 01:54:25,920
he

2881
01:54:25,920 --> 01:54:28,000
he had mentioned um

2882
01:54:28,000 --> 01:54:29,199
like there's certain things that you

2883
01:54:29,199 --> 01:54:31,760
have to pay for to um

2884
01:54:31,760 --> 01:54:32,639
like

2885
01:54:32,639 --> 01:54:33,520
you know

2886
01:54:33,520 --> 01:54:35,840
certain features to to monitor or keep

2887
01:54:35,840 --> 01:54:37,920
track of or use certain bots to verify

2888
01:54:37,920 --> 01:54:40,400
because it gets really really spammy in

2889
01:54:40,400 --> 01:54:43,599
discords um so he was just going over

2890
01:54:43,599 --> 01:54:44,480
like

2891
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:45,520
weighing

2892
01:54:45,520 --> 01:54:48,000
that weighing the um

2893
01:54:48,000 --> 01:54:50,400
the pros and cons with that and what

2894
01:54:50,400 --> 01:54:52,719
those monthly expenses would look like

2895
01:54:52,719 --> 01:54:55,119
um because i believe the the features

2896
01:54:55,119 --> 01:54:57,760
are like they're monthly so um

2897
01:54:57,760 --> 01:54:59,199
if there was a yearly one we could have

2898
01:54:59,199 --> 01:54:59,920
just

2899
01:54:59,920 --> 01:55:02,480
purchased it right out but um

2900
01:55:02,480 --> 01:55:04,639
you know he's he's just trying to figure

2901
01:55:04,639 --> 01:55:05,920
out um

2902
01:55:05,920 --> 01:55:08,239
what features would better suit

2903
01:55:08,239 --> 01:55:10,960
most of the people uh joining and how we

2904
01:55:10,960 --> 01:55:13,040
can keep track of certain things collect

2905
01:55:13,040 --> 01:55:14,880
certain data spread

2906
01:55:14,880 --> 01:55:15,760
um

2907
01:55:15,760 --> 01:55:18,080
you know the channels out um we're just

2908
01:55:18,080 --> 01:55:20,400
you know working on some creative uh

2909
01:55:20,400 --> 01:55:22,960
avenues to be able to um

2910
01:55:22,960 --> 01:55:24,880
you know take this into

2911
01:55:24,880 --> 01:55:27,440
um so once it gets up and running i'm

2912
01:55:27,440 --> 01:55:29,920
you know you guys i'll let you guys know

2913
01:55:29,920 --> 01:55:32,239
quickly i think that um i believe that

2914
01:55:32,239 --> 01:55:34,239
it's it's monday coming that that he's

2915
01:55:34,239 --> 01:55:35,440
gonna have it up and running we're gonna

2916
01:55:35,440 --> 01:55:38,080
be working on it over the weekend um but

2917
01:55:38,080 --> 01:55:39,679
it should certainly be

2918
01:55:39,679 --> 01:55:42,560
uh monday coming because i i really hate

2919
01:55:42,560 --> 01:55:44,480
the fact like when i'm sitting here

2920
01:55:44,480 --> 01:55:46,320
trading sometimes at night or i'm just

2921
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:48,320
watching the charts i really hate the

2922
01:55:48,320 --> 01:55:51,199
fact that i can't share with you guys

2923
01:55:51,199 --> 01:55:52,880
you know at least you know you guys who

2924
01:55:52,880 --> 01:55:55,440
come and support all the time i really

2925
01:55:55,440 --> 01:55:57,920
really do hate the fact that i can't

2926
01:55:57,920 --> 01:56:00,239
share with you guys stuff that i'm still

2927
01:56:00,239 --> 01:56:02,239
seeing after the fact you know many

2928
01:56:02,239 --> 01:56:04,400
times i'm tempted to just like

2929
01:56:04,400 --> 01:56:06,080
go back on stream

2930
01:56:06,080 --> 01:56:07,280
and

2931
01:56:07,280 --> 01:56:10,080
and look at something on stream to to

2932
01:56:10,080 --> 01:56:11,679
you know show you guys

2933
01:56:11,679 --> 01:56:13,280
you know or or i'm like you know what

2934
01:56:13,280 --> 01:56:14,800
let me just

2935
01:56:14,800 --> 01:56:17,119
let me just put a quick video up maybe

2936
01:56:17,119 --> 01:56:19,760
and they could catch it then but

2937
01:56:19,760 --> 01:56:21,520
why not try to create it to where it's

2938
01:56:21,520 --> 01:56:22,960
in real time

2939
01:56:22,960 --> 01:56:24,719
because that would probably better serve

2940
01:56:24,719 --> 01:56:26,000
you guys

2941
01:56:26,000 --> 01:56:28,400
you know if i was to create something in

2942
01:56:28,400 --> 01:56:30,800
real time that you know i'm sending

2943
01:56:30,800 --> 01:56:32,880
stuff along and you guys can just use it

2944
01:56:32,880 --> 01:56:34,239
as ideas

2945
01:56:34,239 --> 01:56:36,000
you know so that's where the discord

2946
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:38,400
becomes very impactful but um he's

2947
01:56:38,400 --> 01:56:40,800
working on it um it should be up and

2948
01:56:40,800 --> 01:56:43,920
running by monday um i'm gonna you know

2949
01:56:43,920 --> 01:56:46,320
get on it over the weekend with him put

2950
01:56:46,320 --> 01:56:49,440
all the the last few things in place and

2951
01:56:49,440 --> 01:56:52,000
um you know we we can just we'll just go

2952
01:56:52,000 --> 01:56:54,000
from there but um

2953
01:56:54,000 --> 01:56:57,760
worst case scenario if if he doesn't

2954
01:56:57,760 --> 01:57:00,159
have it up by monday worst case which i

2955
01:57:00,159 --> 01:57:01,840
think he will he's you know great at

2956
01:57:01,840 --> 01:57:05,119
what he does um worst case scenario i'll

2957
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:07,440
create a um

2958
01:57:07,440 --> 01:57:08,840
group on

2959
01:57:08,840 --> 01:57:11,119
telegram and i'll just start to send

2960
01:57:11,119 --> 01:57:13,119
stuff through there

2961
01:57:13,119 --> 01:57:15,679
until the discord is is created because

2962
01:57:15,679 --> 01:57:17,760
i i realize like the power of the

2963
01:57:17,760 --> 01:57:20,239
discord and also why it's needed watch

2964
01:57:20,239 --> 01:57:23,280
this snd up here guys um i realize the

2965
01:57:23,280 --> 01:57:25,040
the power of the discord and and why

2966
01:57:25,040 --> 01:57:26,480
it's needed and how it could be more

2967
01:57:26,480 --> 01:57:27,520

01:58:02,159 --> 01:58:03,679
this one

2984
01:58:03,679 --> 01:58:07,760
didn't get tapped into yet oh no it did

2985
01:58:07,760 --> 01:58:09,679
yeah this did get tapped into

2986
01:58:09,679 --> 01:58:11,199
so you see how it puts in the low and

2987
01:58:11,199 --> 01:58:15,520
then immediately runs it this this here

2988
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,320
this here as well

2989
01:58:18,480 --> 01:58:20,400
you see how we put in the low and we run

2990
01:58:20,400 --> 01:58:22,639
the high and then we come back and tap

2991
01:58:22,639 --> 01:58:25,599
into the area and then go up to the s

2992
01:58:25,599 --> 01:58:28,560
and d and then away from the s and d now

2993
01:58:28,560 --> 01:58:30,560
we could be running this or we should be

2994
01:58:30,560 --> 01:58:31,760
running this because it was already

2995
01:58:31,760 --> 01:58:34,960
mitigated you know like this this is

2996
01:58:34,960 --> 01:58:37,040
what i'm talking about like you you

2997
01:58:37,040 --> 01:58:40,000
could see this all the time

2998
01:58:40,000 --> 01:58:41,920
every single day

2999
01:58:41,920 --> 01:58:44,000
everywhere

3000
01:58:44,000 --> 01:58:46,400
you see this so look this came up

3001
01:58:46,400 --> 01:58:48,400
tapped into the s and d

3002
01:58:48,400 --> 01:58:50,239
went into the imbalance

3003
01:58:50,239 --> 01:58:52,239
came back to the snd that was created

3004
01:58:52,239 --> 01:58:55,520
again went up to the smd above left the

3005
01:58:55,520 --> 01:58:58,719
s and d came below ran the lows run the

3006
01:58:58,719 --> 01:59:01,119
low could come back up into the s d

3007
01:59:01,119 --> 01:59:03,760
trade away from the snd come back down

3008
01:59:03,760 --> 01:59:05,920
to run the low again or come back into

3009
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:08,480
an snd below only to make its way back

3010
01:59:08,480 --> 01:59:10,400
up and possibly take the high and

3011
01:59:10,400 --> 01:59:12,560
further mitigate this s d

3012
01:59:12,560 --> 01:59:15,119
those are things that price does over

3013
01:59:15,119 --> 01:59:16,960
and over and over and over again i get

3014
01:59:16,960 --> 01:59:18,960
that it sounds like the explanation

3015
01:59:18,960 --> 01:59:22,080
sounded like a lot i understand that but

3016
01:59:22,080 --> 01:59:25,840
this happens everywhere on everything

3017
01:59:25,840 --> 01:59:27,440
everywhere

3018
01:59:27,440 --> 01:59:28,239
so

3019
01:59:28,239 --> 01:59:30,719
those things tend to happen and and

3020
01:59:30,719 --> 01:59:32,800
that's what i want people to

3021
01:59:32,800 --> 01:59:36,239
like really learn and and understand

3022
01:59:36,239 --> 01:59:40,400
like the birthplace of these concepts

3023
01:59:40,400 --> 01:59:42,159
and and why

3024
01:59:42,159 --> 01:59:44,080
you know these things happen and how

3025
01:59:44,080 --> 01:59:45,679
you're able to take advantage of it look

3026
01:59:45,679 --> 01:59:48,560
at this this is an imbalance i told you

3027
01:59:48,560 --> 01:59:50,719
that that sometimes imbalances can be

3028
01:59:50,719 --> 01:59:52,480
used as scalps so look we got a

3029
01:59:52,480 --> 01:59:54,239
rejection from this

3030
01:59:54,239 --> 01:59:57,199
snd zone here this

3031
01:59:57,199 --> 01:59:57,520
picked fractal

3032
01:59:57,520 --> 01:59:59,360
a rejection from it

3033
01:59:59,360 --> 02:00:01,760
then we had an imbalance

3034
02:00:01,760 --> 02:00:04,480
that was tapped into here

3035
02:00:04,480 --> 02:00:07,199
price taps into the imbalance

3036
02:00:07,199 --> 02:00:08,560
pushes up

3037
02:00:08,560 --> 02:00:11,040
what does that give us

3038
02:00:11,040 --> 02:00:13,280
23 pips

3039
02:00:13,280 --> 02:00:15,599
after just tapping the imbalance

3040
02:00:15,599 --> 02:00:17,760
you're out

3041
02:00:17,760 --> 02:00:19,840
most of the time you get more than 20

3042
02:00:19,840 --> 02:00:21,840
pips from from somebody's trading so if

3043
02:00:21,840 --> 02:00:24,639
20 pips would would it was the marker

3044
02:00:24,639 --> 02:00:27,440
for here pace

3045
02:00:27,440 --> 02:00:30,239
you're out as soon as you get in

3046
02:00:30,239 --> 02:00:32,560
in and out just like that

3047
02:00:32,560 --> 02:00:35,199
over trade close it i'm done

3048
02:00:35,199 --> 02:00:37,840
20 pips i'm out

3049
02:00:37,840 --> 02:00:40,960
just like that that easy

3050
02:00:40,960 --> 02:00:42,800
like you you just gotta pay attention to

3051
02:00:42,800 --> 02:00:44,960
these important areas and and i'm i'm

3052
02:00:44,960 --> 02:00:46,719
more than sure that

3053
02:00:46,719 --> 02:00:47,599
you know

3054
02:00:47,599 --> 02:00:49,360
the the fractals you could use the same

3055
02:00:49,360 --> 02:00:52,480
way look at this the tap on the fractal

3056
02:00:52,480 --> 02:00:55,119
bam right here what do we do push up

3057
02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:58,800
come on 20 pips again come on

3058
02:01:06,560 --> 02:01:09,840
like really

3059
02:01:10,080 --> 02:01:13,040
and and this this could be oh wow look

3060
02:01:13,040 --> 02:01:15,040
you you had gotten a rejection from

3061
02:01:15,040 --> 02:01:16,960
there back into this area 42 pip

3062
02:01:16,960 --> 02:01:19,360
rejection tap into this area go back up

3063
02:01:19,360 --> 02:01:23,119
to the s d 49 pips go from the s and d

3064
02:01:23,119 --> 02:01:25,840
and tap from the sd and come down to the

3065
02:01:25,840 --> 02:01:27,119
the um

3066
02:01:27,119 --> 02:01:30,000
first to the fractal

3067
02:01:30,000 --> 02:01:33,920
73 pips from from sorry the imbalance

3068
02:01:33,920 --> 02:01:36,400
73 pips from the imbalance you tap into

3069
02:01:36,400 --> 02:01:39,360
the imbalance come up 25 pips

3070
02:01:39,360 --> 02:01:41,440
from the imbalance

3071
02:01:41,440 --> 02:01:43,599
pushing up you get a fractal

3072
02:01:43,599 --> 02:01:47,360
20 pips from the fractal

3073
02:01:47,360 --> 02:01:49,599
like

3074
02:01:49,679 --> 02:01:52,719
that is astonishing

3075
02:01:52,719 --> 02:01:55,119
i don't know anybody that's trading this

3076
02:01:55,119 --> 02:01:56,800
way i don't know anybody that's doing

3077
02:01:56,800 --> 02:02:00,800
this that's astonishing

3078
02:02:00,800 --> 02:02:02,800
that this is the way that price moves

3079
02:02:02,800 --> 02:02:04,639
and and

3080
02:02:04,639 --> 02:02:07,639
99

3081
02:02:08,000 --> 02:02:09,679
of people

3082
02:02:09,679 --> 02:02:11,599
99

3083
02:02:11,599 --> 02:02:12,960
99

3084
02:02:12,960 --> 02:02:16,320
percent of people

3085
02:02:16,320 --> 02:02:20,800
are oblivious to this like

3086
02:02:20,800 --> 02:02:23,360
you could go and show them and they will

3087
02:02:23,360 --> 02:02:24,960
still choose to hold on to the

3088
02:02:24,960 --> 02:02:27,119
indicators they will still choose to

3089
02:02:27,119 --> 02:02:28,480
hold on to

3090
02:02:28,480 --> 02:02:30,480
to all the different techniques that

3091
02:02:30,480 --> 02:02:32,800
that that they've used they will still

3092
02:02:32,800 --> 02:02:35,360
hold on to those things

3093
02:02:35,360 --> 02:02:37,760
still

3094
02:02:39,360 --> 02:02:40,800
so look

3095
02:02:40,800 --> 02:02:42,480
this looks like

3096
02:02:42,480 --> 02:02:44,400
a head and shoulders

3097
02:02:44,400 --> 02:02:46,480
that would have worked out if you use

3098
02:02:46,480 --> 02:02:50,639
the neckline break and and you took it

3099
02:02:50,960 --> 02:02:52,639
this would have looked like an inverse

3100
02:02:52,639 --> 02:02:54,239
head and shoulders

3101
02:02:54,239 --> 02:02:57,520
that if you use the neckline break

3102
02:02:57,520 --> 02:02:58,840
it would have took you

3103
02:02:58,840 --> 02:03:01,599
there but just the simple fact that

3104
02:03:01,599 --> 02:03:04,000
these happen sometimes and other times

3105
02:03:04,000 --> 02:03:05,520
it doesn't

3106
02:03:05,520 --> 02:03:08,400
is an indication that that's not what

3107
02:03:08,400 --> 02:03:10,320
you want to rely on

3108
02:03:10,320 --> 02:03:13,679
could you imagine if you went to work

3109
02:03:13,679 --> 02:03:14,480
hey

3110
02:03:14,480 --> 02:03:15,679
hey

3111
02:03:15,679 --> 02:03:18,239
cut it out

3112
02:03:18,719 --> 02:03:20,560
he hears me get excited and then he

3113
02:03:20,560 --> 02:03:22,560
starts yelling

3114
02:03:22,560 --> 02:03:24,639
could could you imagine if you went to

3115
02:03:24,639 --> 02:03:25,760
work

3116
02:03:25,760 --> 02:03:27,199
and

3117
02:03:27,199 --> 02:03:30,159
50 percent of the time

3118
02:03:30,159 --> 02:03:32,000
they paid you

3119
02:03:32,000 --> 02:03:34,320
50

3120
02:03:35,199 --> 02:03:36,719
could you imagine that

3121
02:03:36,719 --> 02:03:39,760
coming into the charts

3122
02:03:39,760 --> 02:03:43,199
i'm here teaching two hours now

3123
02:03:43,199 --> 02:03:46,480
coming into the charts

3124
02:03:46,719 --> 02:03:48,960
and

3125
02:03:49,520 --> 02:03:52,320
some days i get paid some days i don't

3126
02:03:52,320 --> 02:03:54,400
what is that

3127
02:03:54,400 --> 02:03:57,119
there's no way

3128
02:03:57,119 --> 02:03:58,800
there's no way

3129
02:03:58,800 --> 02:04:00,320
i would never go and work for somebody

3130
02:04:00,320 --> 02:04:02,239
and get paid half of the time why would

3131
02:04:02,239 --> 02:04:05,199
i come into here and do this

3132
02:04:05,199 --> 02:04:06,960
why would i do that

3133
02:04:06,960 --> 02:04:08,480
there's no way

3134
02:04:08,480 --> 02:04:09,360
no

3135
02:04:09,360 --> 02:04:12,159
no way possible i i can't

3136
02:04:12,159 --> 02:04:13,920
i would never be a part of something

3137
02:04:13,920 --> 02:04:15,119
like that

3138
02:04:15,119 --> 02:04:16,480
see look at this i said i like to see

3139
02:04:16,480 --> 02:04:18,560
the double bottom around our entry i use

3140
02:04:18,560 --> 02:04:20,639
double bottoms entirely different than

3141
02:04:20,639 --> 02:04:22,639
than other people use it because double

3142
02:04:22,639 --> 02:04:24,320
bottoms only have certain purposes

3143
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:25,920
whether it's to go to

3144
02:04:25,920 --> 02:04:27,360
a um

3145
02:04:27,360 --> 02:04:28,639
an s d

3146
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:31,520
that's above or whether it's to go to um

3147
02:04:31,520 --> 02:04:33,599
an imbalance sorter

3148
02:04:33,599 --> 02:04:35,119
so there's this s and d right here at

3149
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:37,599
this line of 842 but then there's also

3150
02:04:37,599 --> 02:04:39,440
this one above here

3151
02:04:39,440 --> 02:04:41,119
at um

3152
02:04:41,119 --> 02:04:45,119
a61 but you see how easy it is to

3153
02:04:45,119 --> 02:04:48,159
take the first entry

3154
02:04:48,320 --> 02:04:50,239
take the first entry

3155
02:04:50,239 --> 02:04:52,400
and scalp it up what was that the 20 pip

3156
02:04:52,400 --> 02:04:54,639
entry and then came around and gave us a

3157
02:04:54,639 --> 02:04:57,360
pattern where we knew that we could

3158
02:04:57,360 --> 02:04:59,760
potentially look so it it

3159
02:04:59,760 --> 02:05:02,400
it came up popped up it came back down

3160
02:05:02,400 --> 02:05:04,560
took out the low but then ran the high

3161
02:05:04,560 --> 02:05:07,040
immediately after so we're looking for

3162
02:05:07,040 --> 02:05:09,599
it to come back within this particular

3163
02:05:09,599 --> 02:05:11,280
area here

3164
02:05:11,280 --> 02:05:13,280
it comes back within this area and it

3165
02:05:13,280 --> 02:05:15,840
taps and and takes us up it takes us

3166
02:05:15,840 --> 02:05:19,280
long to wear snd to snd fractal to snd

3167
02:05:19,280 --> 02:05:20,400
fractal to

3168
02:05:20,400 --> 02:05:23,280
imbalance and balance to fractal

3169
02:05:23,280 --> 02:05:24,719
zones that's it

3170
02:05:24,719 --> 02:05:25,920
zones

3171
02:05:25,920 --> 02:05:28,880
look at this 60 pips up already from the

3172
02:05:28,880 --> 02:05:32,639
second entry the first was 20.

3173
02:05:32,639 --> 02:05:35,040
the first was 20.

3174
02:05:35,040 --> 02:05:37,520
60 pips up after

3175
02:05:37,520 --> 02:05:39,280
like this is i'm trying to teach you

3176
02:05:39,280 --> 02:05:40,960
guys like

3177
02:05:40,960 --> 02:05:43,040
life-changing information

3178
02:05:43,040 --> 02:05:44,639
because i know yo like something could

3179
02:05:44,639 --> 02:05:46,840
happen with my health

3180
02:05:46,840 --> 02:05:49,440
tomorrow anything i could be taken out

3181
02:05:49,440 --> 02:05:51,360
this stuff needs to be here for for

3182
02:05:51,360 --> 02:05:52,880
people to

3183
02:05:52,880 --> 02:05:54,719
you know learn for people to understand

3184
02:05:54,719 --> 02:05:56,480
people to change their circumstances i

3185
02:05:56,480 --> 02:05:58,079
believe that there's still great people

3186
02:05:58,079 --> 02:05:59,280
in the world

3187
02:05:59,280 --> 02:06:01,440
and and i've been shown that you know

3188
02:06:01,440 --> 02:06:02,800
from

3189
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:04,960
from like so many people that i've met

3190
02:06:04,960 --> 02:06:07,119
over the last year or so

3191
02:06:07,119 --> 02:06:08,880
there are still great people in this

3192
02:06:08,880 --> 02:06:09,679
world

3193
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:11,520
like i don't care what anybody says i

3194
02:06:11,520 --> 02:06:12,639
don't care what has happened i don't

3195
02:06:12,639 --> 02:06:14,400
care what anybody has done to you i

3196
02:06:14,400 --> 02:06:16,079
don't care what our governments are

3197
02:06:16,079 --> 02:06:19,520
doing there are still some great people

3198
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:22,320
in the world and

3199
02:06:22,320 --> 02:06:25,280
those great people need to be equipped

3200
02:06:25,280 --> 02:06:26,960
to continue

3201
02:06:26,960 --> 02:06:31,040
to do great things for others

3202
02:06:31,040 --> 02:06:33,360
they need to be able to do that so

3203
02:06:33,360 --> 02:06:34,239
so

3204
02:06:34,239 --> 02:06:36,800
they could continue to pass on that

3205
02:06:36,800 --> 02:06:38,960
humanity not just through

3206
02:06:38,960 --> 02:06:40,960
through um

3207
02:06:40,960 --> 02:06:43,199
you know like being good and saying good

3208
02:06:43,199 --> 02:06:46,880
words but good in actions also

3209
02:06:46,880 --> 02:06:50,320
we have such an issue with with

3210
02:06:50,320 --> 02:06:52,400
you know homeless kids and

3211
02:06:52,400 --> 02:06:53,280
kids

3212
02:06:53,280 --> 02:06:55,840
you know in poverty and like america

3213
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,800
sends so much money to places and

3214
02:06:58,800 --> 02:07:00,960
we have kids in poverty

3215
02:07:00,960 --> 02:07:03,520
in new york we have a hundred thousand

3216
02:07:03,520 --> 02:07:05,679
homeless kids that attend the public

3217
02:07:05,679 --> 02:07:08,159
schools a hundred thousand

3218
02:07:08,159 --> 02:07:09,520
yet we have

3219
02:07:09,520 --> 02:07:12,639
billions of dollars in new york

3220
02:07:12,639 --> 02:07:15,760
our our um uh budgets

3221
02:07:15,760 --> 02:07:18,480
overall for the entire city

3222
02:07:18,480 --> 02:07:20,560
is and that's just the city not even the

3223
02:07:20,560 --> 02:07:23,360
state but the city it's like 80 billion

3224
02:07:23,360 --> 02:07:26,400
dollars 90 billion dollars

3225
02:07:26,400 --> 02:07:28,639
that's our budget to work with in

3226
02:07:28,639 --> 02:07:30,560
certain things

3227
02:07:30,560 --> 02:07:33,599
where is most of our money going

3228
02:07:33,599 --> 02:07:37,360
to areas that create profit for

3229
02:07:37,360 --> 02:07:38,840
for the

3230
02:07:38,840 --> 02:07:40,800
government so you're gonna put a lot of

3231
02:07:40,800 --> 02:07:42,960
funding into policing you're gonna put a

3232
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:45,440
lot of funding into development you can

3233
02:07:45,440 --> 02:07:47,360
put a lot of funding into subsidies so

3234
02:07:47,360 --> 02:07:49,760
you can get larger companies to come

3235
02:07:49,760 --> 02:07:51,520
into new york and create jobs that

3236
02:07:51,520 --> 02:07:54,079
creates tax revenue for them to do crazy

3237
02:07:54,079 --> 02:07:55,840
things without taxes in the first place

3238
02:07:55,840 --> 02:07:56,960
you know like

3239
02:07:56,960 --> 02:07:59,599
all of that happens

3240
02:07:59,599 --> 02:08:02,320
and it's wild

3241
02:08:02,320 --> 02:08:03,440
and we got

3242
02:08:03,440 --> 02:08:06,719
a hundred thousand homeless kids

3243
02:08:06,719 --> 02:08:08,719
here going to school and they're

3244
02:08:08,719 --> 02:08:12,960
homeless a hundred thousand

3245
02:08:13,199 --> 02:08:14,880
remind you i could drive around in new

3246
02:08:14,880 --> 02:08:16,320
york i could drive around to each

3247
02:08:16,320 --> 02:08:18,880
borough and i can tap each borough and

3248
02:08:18,880 --> 02:08:21,040
probably

3249
02:08:21,040 --> 02:08:23,599
i don't know get there in like

3250
02:08:23,599 --> 02:08:25,040
hour and a half like a circle in new

3251
02:08:25,040 --> 02:08:27,040
york

3252
02:08:27,040 --> 02:08:29,199
i want to have maybe two hours depending

3253
02:08:29,199 --> 02:08:30,320
on if there's traffic and stuff like

3254
02:08:30,320 --> 02:08:32,079
that too but i could circle new york

3255
02:08:32,079 --> 02:08:34,960
within that time

3256
02:08:34,960 --> 02:08:37,119
and how is it that it's a hundred

3257
02:08:37,119 --> 02:08:39,040
thousand homeless kids

3258
02:08:39,040 --> 02:08:42,639
within that radius

3259
02:08:42,639 --> 02:08:45,520
and we do nothing about it

3260
02:08:45,520 --> 02:08:47,760
it's despicable

3261
02:08:47,760 --> 02:08:49,119
you know so i know there's good people

3262
02:08:49,119 --> 02:08:51,520
in the world and and i want let me turn

3263
02:08:51,520 --> 02:08:52,880
this back on guys

3264
02:08:52,880 --> 02:08:55,440
and i want um

3265
02:08:55,440 --> 02:08:57,760
i want people to

3266
02:08:57,760 --> 02:08:58,719
you know

3267
02:08:58,719 --> 02:09:00,880
be able to

3268
02:09:00,880 --> 02:09:02,719
to kind of

3269
02:09:02,719 --> 02:09:04,960
do the things that our governments

3270
02:09:04,960 --> 02:09:07,360
aren't willing to do do the things that

3271
02:09:07,360 --> 02:09:08,800
some of our churches are doing and some

3272
02:09:08,800 --> 02:09:10,639
of our churches are not doing

3273
02:09:10,639 --> 02:09:12,880
i want to be able to

3274
02:09:12,880 --> 02:09:15,119
like create

3275
02:09:15,119 --> 02:09:17,679
you know that type of wealth and

3276
02:09:17,679 --> 02:09:19,760
compassion and care i know when it comes

3277
02:09:19,760 --> 02:09:21,599
to money there's a lot of like

3278
02:09:21,599 --> 02:09:23,520
heartlessness going on like

3279
02:09:23,520 --> 02:09:26,079
you know wall street would eat me up

3280
02:09:26,079 --> 02:09:27,360
if

3281
02:09:27,360 --> 02:09:29,760
they knew i was teaching this and it's

3282
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:32,800
such quality and and it's all going out

3283
02:09:32,800 --> 02:09:34,639
there for free wall street would tear me

3284
02:09:34,639 --> 02:09:36,239
to pieces

3285
02:09:36,239 --> 02:09:37,360
so

3286
02:09:37,360 --> 02:09:40,159
just with that alone like you know i

3287
02:09:40,159 --> 02:09:42,800
want you guys to to understand that

3288
02:09:42,800 --> 02:09:44,239
i'm doing this knowing that i'm going

3289
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:47,440
against the grain one

3290
02:09:47,440 --> 02:09:48,800
but two

3291
02:09:48,800 --> 02:09:51,119
it's because the way i was raised

3292
02:09:51,119 --> 02:09:52,639
they they're trying to turn the markets

3293
02:09:52,639 --> 02:09:54,800
24 hours they're trying to make it 24

3294
02:09:54,800 --> 02:09:56,800
hours seven days a week

3295
02:09:56,800 --> 02:09:58,159
that just means that there's more money

3296
02:09:58,159 --> 02:10:00,719
for them to take from us if they were to

3297
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:02,800
turn it that way

3298
02:10:02,800 --> 02:10:04,960
so why not get ahead of that

3299
02:10:04,960 --> 02:10:06,960
you know and and that's kind of where i

3300
02:10:06,960 --> 02:10:08,639
am

3301
02:10:08,639 --> 02:10:10,239
getting ahead of that

3302
02:10:10,239 --> 02:10:11,760
because i'm showing you stuff that's

3303
02:10:11,760 --> 02:10:15,280
happening in real time

3304
02:10:15,280 --> 02:10:16,960
i told you i said

3305
02:10:16,960 --> 02:10:19,040
if we tap into this area

3306
02:10:19,040 --> 02:10:20,159
we can

3307
02:10:20,159 --> 02:10:22,000
you know get a quick scout but we may be

3308
02:10:22,000 --> 02:10:23,760
able to come up and tap into maybe this

3309
02:10:23,760 --> 02:10:25,679
s d or this one above

3310
02:10:25,679 --> 02:10:28,719
what do we do tap this smd here

3311
02:10:28,719 --> 02:10:30,239
i told you sometimes it will just tap

3312
02:10:30,239 --> 02:10:32,480
the bottom of it and then reject the way

3313
02:10:32,480 --> 02:10:34,639
and oftentimes if it rejects away after

3314
02:10:34,639 --> 02:10:36,560
top and the bottom a lot of the times if

3315
02:10:36,560 --> 02:10:39,360
you don't get any rejection out of here

3316
02:10:39,360 --> 02:10:42,000
then it's going to take the high of this

3317
02:10:42,000 --> 02:10:44,960
probably up into the next smd

3318
02:10:44,960 --> 02:10:46,560
and then if that does happen guess what

3319
02:10:46,560 --> 02:10:49,199
that looks like

3320
02:10:55,040 --> 02:10:57,040
tap here

3321
02:10:57,040 --> 02:10:58,719
neckline break

3322
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:00,719
right here

3323
02:11:00,719 --> 02:11:03,040
short

3324
02:11:04,800 --> 02:11:06,639
just like that

3325
02:11:06,639 --> 02:11:08,840
that's how they get us each and every

3326
02:11:08,840 --> 02:11:12,560
time just like that nothing different

3327
02:11:12,560 --> 02:11:13,920
each and every time they get us like

3328
02:11:13,920 --> 02:11:15,119
that

3329
02:11:15,119 --> 02:11:16,719
it's like oh yeah take it back up there

3330
02:11:16,719 --> 02:11:18,159
it can go up there i'm not saying that

3331
02:11:18,159 --> 02:11:20,159
it can't but i'm saying that they

3332
02:11:20,159 --> 02:11:22,000
understand our psychology like the way

3333
02:11:22,000 --> 02:11:24,159
that we think and it looks like that and

3334
02:11:24,159 --> 02:11:27,760
then they end up railing against us

3335
02:11:27,760 --> 02:11:30,880
you know and that's just this

3336
02:11:30,880 --> 02:11:33,280
it's not something that that i want

3337
02:11:33,280 --> 02:11:35,760
anybody to experience

3338
02:11:35,760 --> 02:11:37,920
it's not something i want to happen to

3339
02:11:37,920 --> 02:11:40,480
anyone

3340
02:11:40,480 --> 02:11:42,800
you know

3341
02:11:42,800 --> 02:11:44,320
so

3342
02:11:44,320 --> 02:11:46,560
that's why i'm i'm here and that's why i

3343
02:11:46,560 --> 02:11:49,920
do this and and it's

3344
02:11:49,920 --> 02:11:52,320
just solely because of that i get that i

3345
02:11:52,320 --> 02:11:54,480
go off into tangents and i ran a lot and

3346
02:11:54,480 --> 02:11:56,400
all that other stuff you know great you

3347
02:11:56,400 --> 02:11:57,360
know

3348
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:01,199
but um it's for the greater good

3349
02:12:01,199 --> 02:12:03,040
you know it's it's definitely for the

3350
02:12:03,040 --> 02:12:04,560
greater good

3351
02:12:04,560 --> 02:12:05,679
um

3352
02:12:05,679 --> 02:12:08,079
might be an imbalance fill here or could

3353
02:12:08,079 --> 02:12:09,840
leave it behind and just continue up and

3354
02:12:09,840 --> 02:12:11,679
then the next thing comes in taps in and

3355
02:12:11,679 --> 02:12:12,800
then

3356
02:12:12,800 --> 02:12:14,639
takes it up or it just runs too we'll

3357
02:12:14,639 --> 02:12:16,400
see what happens there but this

3358
02:12:16,400 --> 02:12:18,800
oftentimes what happens it tries to make

3359
02:12:18,800 --> 02:12:20,480
its way back to feel the imbalance and

3360
02:12:20,480 --> 02:12:22,320
then

3361
02:12:22,320 --> 02:12:24,239
and the imbalance is usually

3362
02:12:24,239 --> 02:12:25,119
um

3363
02:12:25,119 --> 02:12:26,800
like when it quickly fills sometimes

3364
02:12:26,800 --> 02:12:29,360
it's with the next candle that's open

3365
02:12:29,360 --> 02:12:31,440
the following candle opens you could

3366
02:12:31,440 --> 02:12:32,639
potentially

3367
02:12:32,639 --> 02:12:35,760
have some move back up and then

3368
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:38,960
attack back into the imbalance and then

3369
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:41,440
price trades away from it you know like

3370
02:12:41,440 --> 02:12:44,400
that could happen too

3371
02:12:44,480 --> 02:12:46,639
but yeah that like

3372
02:12:46,639 --> 02:12:49,199
these are these are things that

3373
02:12:49,199 --> 02:12:51,760
that happen within the market and and

3374
02:12:51,760 --> 02:12:53,520
i'm trying to

3375
02:12:53,520 --> 02:12:55,599
get people to understand that and get

3376
02:12:55,599 --> 02:12:58,560
away from these garbage traders like

3377
02:12:58,560 --> 02:13:00,320
i know somebody told me not to name drop

3378
02:13:00,320 --> 02:13:01,920
traders and stuff like that so i haven't

3379
02:13:01,920 --> 02:13:04,000
been doing it to stay out of beef

3380
02:13:04,000 --> 02:13:06,079
you know but you know

3381
02:13:06,079 --> 02:13:08,800
it's it's it's so sickening to to see

3382
02:13:08,800 --> 02:13:10,480
this stuff like i said when i first

3383
02:13:10,480 --> 02:13:12,639
started trading this one guy was like oh

3384
02:13:12,639 --> 02:13:13,840
i have these

3385
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:16,400
you know we have this free telegram this

3386
02:13:16,400 --> 02:13:18,560
free group you know you guys can join

3387
02:13:18,560 --> 02:13:19,679
and

3388
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:21,040
you know like just

3389
02:13:21,040 --> 02:13:23,679
learn from other traders and just foster

3390
02:13:23,679 --> 02:13:25,360
a great environment you know like he was

3391
02:13:25,360 --> 02:13:28,000
saying all these different things and um

3392
02:13:28,000 --> 02:13:30,079
and i'm like oh great wow that's amazing

3393
02:13:30,079 --> 02:13:31,440
you're like let me join the group he

3394
02:13:31,440 --> 02:13:33,040
sounds so like

3395
02:13:33,040 --> 02:13:34,639
plausible with some of the stuff that he

3396
02:13:34,639 --> 02:13:37,360
was saying watch this snd up here guys

3397
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:39,040
because um

3398
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:42,480
with this smd uh

3399
02:13:42,480 --> 02:13:44,239
this is the one that actually broke

3400
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:46,079
structure

3401
02:13:46,079 --> 02:13:48,560
um here but intermediary structure so

3402
02:13:48,560 --> 02:13:50,639
just watch this

3403
02:13:50,639 --> 02:13:53,520
um but yeah he was like um

3404
02:13:53,520 --> 02:13:55,520
it's like yeah and look this is this is

3405
02:13:55,520 --> 02:13:57,280
also what i'm saying too

3406
02:13:57,280 --> 02:13:58,560
um

3407
02:13:58,560 --> 02:14:00,639
this stab

3408
02:14:00,639 --> 02:14:01,760
that i keep telling you guys about i

3409
02:14:01,760 --> 02:14:03,280
don't know why i keep calling it stab

3410
02:14:03,280 --> 02:14:05,040
but

3411
02:14:05,040 --> 02:14:06,960
this right here

3412
02:14:06,960 --> 02:14:09,199
that stab

3413
02:14:09,199 --> 02:14:10,400
and then

3414
02:14:10,400 --> 02:14:13,360
other areas created to take us back up

3415
02:14:13,360 --> 02:14:15,280
but a lot of the times

3416
02:14:15,280 --> 02:14:17,599
like i mentioned we may just be going to

3417
02:14:17,599 --> 02:14:19,679
structural areas yeah we could run the

3418
02:14:19,679 --> 02:14:21,920
high too if if they're ready to run the

3419
02:14:21,920 --> 02:14:23,520
high i don't control the market the

3420
02:14:23,520 --> 02:14:25,280
banks do so whatever it is that they're

3421
02:14:25,280 --> 02:14:27,360
ready to do they do but this is what i'm

3422
02:14:27,360 --> 02:14:29,119
saying some of these patterns

3423
02:14:29,119 --> 02:14:32,719
they work out sometimes

3424
02:14:32,719 --> 02:14:34,719
not all the time because look

3425
02:14:34,719 --> 02:14:36,480
you would have um

3426
02:14:36,480 --> 02:14:39,119
you'd have taken a short from here or

3427
02:14:39,119 --> 02:14:40,960
this neckline break look

3428
02:14:40,960 --> 02:14:42,960
this here

3429
02:14:42,960 --> 02:14:44,560
taking a short to this neckline breaking

3430
02:14:44,560 --> 02:14:47,760
you trying to take it down here

3431
02:14:49,040 --> 02:14:52,000
stops above here

3432
02:14:52,400 --> 02:14:54,000
here's here's where your neckline break

3433
02:14:54,000 --> 02:14:55,360
is

3434
02:14:55,360 --> 02:14:56,880
stops above here

3435
02:14:56,880 --> 02:14:59,159
you're coming down trying to get this

3436
02:14:59,159 --> 02:15:02,000
140 pip trade or whatever it is maybe

3437
02:15:02,000 --> 02:15:04,560
tack the lows maybe hit the s d whatever

3438
02:15:04,560 --> 02:15:06,840
it is didn't come down and do any of

3439
02:15:06,840 --> 02:15:09,280
that so now

3440
02:15:09,280 --> 02:15:12,239
there's a possibility that if this does

3441
02:15:12,239 --> 02:15:13,440
come up

3442
02:15:13,440 --> 02:15:15,360
and it comes to

3443
02:15:15,360 --> 02:15:18,800
tap this area here

3444
02:15:18,800 --> 02:15:19,920
guess what

3445
02:15:19,920 --> 02:15:23,280
this guy is out he put his stop right

3446
02:15:23,280 --> 02:15:25,520
behind the shoulder

3447
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:26,880
would come up

3448
02:15:26,880 --> 02:15:28,560
pierce the shoulder

3449
02:15:28,560 --> 02:15:30,560
and then this guy is out and what kind

3450
02:15:30,560 --> 02:15:33,840
of stop loss is this like there's no way

3451
02:15:33,840 --> 02:15:34,880
you know

3452
02:15:34,880 --> 02:15:38,159
sorry about my ranting guys um

3453
02:15:38,159 --> 02:15:40,320
do you pay attention to s and d flip

3454
02:15:40,320 --> 02:15:42,239
zones

3455
02:15:42,239 --> 02:15:44,159
um i i don't

3456
02:15:44,159 --> 02:15:46,400
i don't really know what what that is um

3457
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,920
maybe if you could like recommend a

3458
02:15:47,920 --> 02:15:49,280
youtube video i'd probably just look

3459
02:15:49,280 --> 02:15:51,040
over real quick

3460
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:52,880
and um pay attention to that but i

3461
02:15:52,880 --> 02:15:55,040
really don't know what um the flip zones

3462
02:15:55,040 --> 02:15:58,800
are now i do know candle flipping um

3463
02:15:58,800 --> 02:16:00,880
it was this trader uh lens i saw her

3464
02:16:00,880 --> 02:16:02,719
doing it official lens she's a retail

3465
02:16:02,719 --> 02:16:05,280
trader um on youtube she has the most

3466
02:16:05,280 --> 02:16:07,440
heart out of all the retail traders that

3467
02:16:07,440 --> 02:16:10,400
are on youtube i will say um

3468
02:16:10,400 --> 02:16:11,920
she does she kind of uses the same

3469
02:16:11,920 --> 02:16:14,239
technique as um raja banks i think she

3470
02:16:14,239 --> 02:16:16,719
was a student of his but um

3471
02:16:16,719 --> 02:16:18,239
you know she's doing this thing now

3472
02:16:18,239 --> 02:16:20,719
where it's like you know

3473
02:16:20,719 --> 02:16:22,960
candle flipping essentially

3474
02:16:22,960 --> 02:16:24,400
you know it's

3475
02:16:24,400 --> 02:16:27,280
it's it's it's like what fractals do

3476
02:16:27,280 --> 02:16:29,679
you know like this

3477
02:16:29,679 --> 02:16:33,280
so price opens up here and goes down

3478
02:16:33,280 --> 02:16:36,080
but if price begins to flip

3479
02:16:36,080 --> 02:16:38,558
back up above this high

3480
02:16:38,558 --> 02:16:41,200
what she would do is

3481
02:16:41,200 --> 02:16:43,599
she would put a limit here

3482
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:45,359
and get tapped in

3483
02:16:45,359 --> 02:16:47,519
with the momentum

3484
02:16:47,519 --> 02:16:48,718
of

3485
02:16:48,718 --> 02:16:51,280
the the candle flipping bullish

3486
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:52,959
and she would place her stops directly

3487
02:16:52,959 --> 02:16:55,200
behind that area

3488
02:16:55,200 --> 02:16:56,879
and take it

3489
02:16:56,879 --> 02:16:58,398
you know wherever

3490
02:16:58,398 --> 02:17:00,558
she believes it's going so sometimes

3491
02:17:00,558 --> 02:17:02,398
she'll take it to the next rejection

3492
02:17:02,398 --> 02:17:04,638
area something like that or when she

3493
02:17:04,638 --> 02:17:06,000
sees um

3494
02:17:06,000 --> 02:17:07,679
price flipping back the other way then

3495
02:17:07,679 --> 02:17:10,638
she's like iron amount or she has like a

3496
02:17:10,638 --> 02:17:14,398
a 30 or 50 pip for whatever on us 30 or

3497
02:17:14,398 --> 02:17:16,318
or whatever it is i i actually started

3498
02:17:16,318 --> 02:17:18,799
watching her um when i first started you

3499
02:17:18,799 --> 02:17:20,638
know you you start watching those people

3500
02:17:20,638 --> 02:17:22,080
that you think are good and then you go

3501
02:17:22,080 --> 02:17:24,160
back and i'm not saying she's that way

3502
02:17:24,160 --> 02:17:26,000
i'm just saying that i started watching

3503
02:17:26,000 --> 02:17:27,840
her um at first

3504
02:17:27,840 --> 02:17:30,080
when i first started learning the ropes

3505
02:17:30,080 --> 02:17:32,638
but she she does um retail teaching i

3506
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:35,200
just don't trade retail so i no longer

3507
02:17:35,200 --> 02:17:36,879
you know really patronize her channel

3508
02:17:36,879 --> 02:17:37,679
but

3509
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:40,080
um yeah it's

3510
02:17:40,080 --> 02:17:41,760
that was candle flipping that she

3511
02:17:41,760 --> 02:17:44,080
explained um i don't know if it's if

3512
02:17:44,080 --> 02:17:46,080
that's the same thing that that you have

3513
02:17:46,080 --> 02:17:47,439
mentioned

3514
02:17:47,439 --> 02:17:48,318
um

3515
02:17:48,318 --> 02:17:50,318
with the flip of the zones i'm not too

3516
02:17:50,318 --> 02:17:52,160
sure but look at this

3517
02:17:52,160 --> 02:17:53,679
imbalance

3518
02:17:53,679 --> 02:17:57,559
oh right up

3519
02:17:57,760 --> 02:17:59,439
like this is

3520
02:17:59,439 --> 02:18:02,559
incredible stuff

3521
02:18:02,718 --> 02:18:04,478
you know we have this little snd zone

3522
02:18:04,478 --> 02:18:06,879
here that we mapped out right here you

3523
02:18:06,879 --> 02:18:08,398
see we got the middle of the snd zone

3524
02:18:08,398 --> 02:18:10,879
and i said sometimes price doesn't touch

3525
02:18:10,879 --> 02:18:13,200
the middle of the s d zone this is why

3526
02:18:13,200 --> 02:18:15,040
you consider to have

3527
02:18:15,040 --> 02:18:17,379
this here

3528
02:18:17,379 --> 02:18:19,599
[Music]

3529
02:18:19,599 --> 02:18:22,799
so if it taps the bottom of it

3530
02:18:22,799 --> 02:18:25,920
cool that's still an a rejection entry

3531
02:18:25,920 --> 02:18:27,679
for you to take it

3532
02:18:27,679 --> 02:18:30,639
to another direction

3533
02:18:31,120 --> 02:18:33,280
so you get rejected out of here

3534
02:18:33,280 --> 02:18:35,040
and this rejection

3535
02:18:35,040 --> 02:18:38,478
facilitates this pullback

3536
02:18:38,478 --> 02:18:41,359
and this pullback could potentially

3537
02:18:41,359 --> 02:18:45,439
find support on this area this imbalance

3538
02:18:45,439 --> 02:18:48,718
and then continue or it could continue

3539
02:18:48,718 --> 02:18:50,080
to go down

3540
02:18:50,080 --> 02:18:50,959
to

3541
02:18:50,959 --> 02:18:53,040
within this area that's a possibility

3542
02:18:53,040 --> 02:18:54,240
too

3543
02:18:54,240 --> 02:18:56,240
but this is why when when you when

3544
02:18:56,240 --> 02:18:57,920
you're aware of how

3545
02:18:57,920 --> 02:18:59,679
these areas function

3546
02:18:59,679 --> 02:19:02,318
you could utilize them as little

3547
02:19:02,318 --> 02:19:05,200
scalping techniques just take fractals

3548
02:19:05,200 --> 02:19:06,879
and imbalances

3549
02:19:06,879 --> 02:19:09,280
play the fractals and the imbalances

3550
02:19:09,280 --> 02:19:11,599
on on um

3551
02:19:11,599 --> 02:19:14,000
you know on back testing

3552
02:19:14,000 --> 02:19:15,920
and see the reactions some will have

3553
02:19:15,920 --> 02:19:17,760
reactions some won't

3554
02:19:17,760 --> 02:19:20,000
but then it would start to familiarize

3555
02:19:20,000 --> 02:19:21,840
you with like

3556
02:19:21,840 --> 02:19:23,760
a reaction that's happening in these

3557
02:19:23,760 --> 02:19:25,280
areas just with the fractals and the

3558
02:19:25,280 --> 02:19:27,120
imbalances alone

3559
02:19:27,120 --> 02:19:28,478
and it'll start to give you a level of

3560
02:19:28,478 --> 02:19:31,200
comfortability on how to implement that

3561
02:19:31,200 --> 02:19:34,558
into your own system if you need to um

3562
02:19:34,558 --> 02:19:37,280
demand turn supply

3563
02:19:37,280 --> 02:19:39,120
splinters into an

3564
02:19:39,120 --> 02:19:40,558
internet show

3565
02:19:40,558 --> 02:19:43,519
yeah yeah so that's that's kind of um

3566
02:19:43,519 --> 02:19:45,920
you know the the smd

3567
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,478
um flip that that

3568
02:19:48,478 --> 02:19:52,240
that other trader uh lens was doing so

3569
02:19:52,240 --> 02:19:53,840
you're um

3570
02:19:53,840 --> 02:19:55,520
you're right uh

3571
02:19:55,520 --> 02:19:56,640
that's um

3572
02:19:56,640 --> 02:19:58,479
it's it's pretty neat it's a pretty neat

3573
02:19:58,479 --> 02:20:00,160
trick for a quick scalp or something

3574
02:20:00,160 --> 02:20:01,600
like that but

3575
02:20:01,600 --> 02:20:02,399
i mean

3576
02:20:02,399 --> 02:20:06,240
i guess for me the risk involved is

3577
02:20:06,240 --> 02:20:07,200
is

3578
02:20:07,200 --> 02:20:09,040
the reason why i don't like retail

3579
02:20:09,040 --> 02:20:11,600
trading there's a lot of risk involved

3580
02:20:11,600 --> 02:20:13,680
the stop losses are

3581
02:20:13,680 --> 02:20:16,479
to heaven or hell and you know it's just

3582
02:20:16,479 --> 02:20:18,000
not something that

3583
02:20:18,000 --> 02:20:19,280
that i

3584
02:20:19,280 --> 02:20:21,280
would really recommend

3585
02:20:21,280 --> 02:20:24,319
um for anybody to pattern trading

3586
02:20:24,319 --> 02:20:25,840
you know like i remember when i first

3587
02:20:25,840 --> 02:20:27,439
started trading i was trying to use all

3588
02:20:27,439 --> 02:20:29,439
of that stuff i'm like okay look this

3589
02:20:29,439 --> 02:20:31,760
this is what i used to do

3590
02:20:31,760 --> 02:20:33,680
let me show you

3591
02:20:33,680 --> 02:20:37,359
uh where is it trend lines

3592
02:20:37,359 --> 02:20:39,040
uh these used to be my friend you see

3593
02:20:39,040 --> 02:20:40,960
the favorite was there on the trend line

3594
02:20:40,960 --> 02:20:43,439
right there

3595
02:20:43,439 --> 02:20:45,120
this used to be mia so i would go just

3596
02:20:45,120 --> 02:20:47,520
like this

3597
02:20:52,319 --> 02:20:56,120
and i would go like this

3598
02:20:59,840 --> 02:21:02,640
and i'd be like

3599
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:06,880
you know price is trading in a channel

3600
02:21:07,359 --> 02:21:08,960
and if it

3601
02:21:08,960 --> 02:21:11,280
pops out of the channel

3602
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:12,080
then

3603
02:21:12,080 --> 02:21:14,000
maybe i would like squeeze it here a

3604
02:21:14,000 --> 02:21:16,240
little bit against

3605
02:21:16,240 --> 02:21:18,479
the um

3606
02:21:18,479 --> 02:21:20,470
just to get like a tighter

3607
02:21:20,470 --> 02:21:21,760
[Music]

3608
02:21:21,760 --> 02:21:24,319
move to it so i would go just like this

3609
02:21:24,319 --> 02:21:25,120
price

3610
02:21:25,120 --> 02:21:27,520
price breaks out of the channel

3611
02:21:27,520 --> 02:21:30,000
you know tap the above channel or or

3612
02:21:30,000 --> 02:21:32,880
wedge or whatever pattern you call it

3613
02:21:32,880 --> 02:21:35,760
you know price breaks out of it

3614
02:21:35,760 --> 02:21:37,680
get it on a retest

3615
02:21:37,680 --> 02:21:39,680
and go

3616
02:21:39,680 --> 02:21:42,080
and what you do is

3617
02:21:42,080 --> 02:21:43,760
on the retest

3618
02:21:43,760 --> 02:21:46,960
your entry is here

3619
02:21:47,359 --> 02:21:48,880
your stops

3620
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:49,920
is

3621
02:21:49,920 --> 02:21:51,840
behind

3622
02:21:51,840 --> 02:21:54,560
the the last touch

3623
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:56,720
and you're targeting

3624
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:58,479
i think

3625
02:21:58,479 --> 02:22:00,800
i think you're supposed to target like

3626
02:22:00,800 --> 02:22:02,479
whatever

3627
02:22:02,479 --> 02:22:04,880
length the break was or something like

3628
02:22:04,880 --> 02:22:06,880
that like the the measurement of

3629
02:22:06,880 --> 02:22:09,200
something that that's i forgot how

3630
02:22:09,200 --> 02:22:11,200
exactly they teach it

3631
02:22:11,200 --> 02:22:13,920
um but it was like 113 pips

3632
02:22:13,920 --> 02:22:16,880
so then you target 113 pips

3633
02:22:16,880 --> 02:22:18,080
and it's like

3634
02:22:18,080 --> 02:22:21,359
oh yeah you know like it hit

3635
02:22:21,359 --> 02:22:23,840
like wow that thing actually works and i

3636
02:22:23,840 --> 02:22:25,520
could have took it longer you're like

3637
02:22:25,520 --> 02:22:27,359
that's what you're thinking in your head

3638
02:22:27,359 --> 02:22:30,080
you know but for me

3639
02:22:30,080 --> 02:22:32,479
i'm looking at this and i'm like

3640
02:22:32,479 --> 02:22:35,200
there's no way that i'm gonna risk

3641
02:22:35,200 --> 02:22:37,359
76 pips

3642
02:22:37,359 --> 02:22:40,240
on this one trade like

3643
02:22:40,240 --> 02:22:41,920
no way

3644
02:22:41,920 --> 02:22:44,160
this is like

3645
02:22:44,160 --> 02:22:45,520
this is like

3646
02:22:45,520 --> 02:22:48,479
30 trades in the asian session you know

3647
02:22:48,479 --> 02:22:52,000
or like this absolutely not

3648
02:22:52,000 --> 02:22:54,160
you know but at first i'm like oh yeah

3649
02:22:54,160 --> 02:22:57,439
so so sometimes when this hit it hits

3650
02:22:57,439 --> 02:22:59,359
but when it doesn't

3651
02:22:59,359 --> 02:23:00,800
miserable

3652
02:23:00,800 --> 02:23:04,800
like absolutely miserable

3653
02:23:04,800 --> 02:23:07,200
you know and it was like

3654
02:23:07,200 --> 02:23:08,880
30 40

3655
02:23:08,880 --> 02:23:10,399
of

3656
02:23:10,399 --> 02:23:12,960
of the time it hits

3657
02:23:12,960 --> 02:23:14,479
you know not always you don't know how

3658
02:23:14,479 --> 02:23:17,520
to really like draw it you don't know

3659
02:23:17,520 --> 02:23:20,479
like if an area is too tight or not you

3660
02:23:20,479 --> 02:23:22,479
don't know if that was the rejection

3661
02:23:22,479 --> 02:23:25,280
from it like so i would also do this

3662
02:23:25,280 --> 02:23:26,960
here

3663
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:30,920
take the trend lines here

3664
02:23:32,560 --> 02:23:35,760
sorry let me fix this

3665
02:23:36,800 --> 02:23:39,120
yeah i would also do that there

3666
02:23:39,120 --> 02:23:41,840
and be like oh that's a falling wedge

3667
02:23:41,840 --> 02:23:44,800
so if price pops out of the wedge

3668
02:23:44,800 --> 02:23:48,160
you getting an entry here

3669
02:23:49,680 --> 02:23:51,920
here

3670
02:23:52,000 --> 02:23:54,080
you place your stops

3671
02:23:54,080 --> 02:23:56,880
behind the wedge

3672
02:23:56,880 --> 02:23:58,560
and

3673
02:23:58,560 --> 02:24:00,399
you're targeting

3674
02:24:00,399 --> 02:24:02,640
like whatever oh the the back of it

3675
02:24:02,640 --> 02:24:04,160
that's right

3676
02:24:04,160 --> 02:24:06,640
you're targeting

3677
02:24:06,640 --> 02:24:08,319
whatever

3678
02:24:08,319 --> 02:24:11,200
the size of the

3679
02:24:11,200 --> 02:24:13,280
the back of the wedges

3680
02:24:13,280 --> 02:24:15,040
that's how much you're targeting going

3681
02:24:15,040 --> 02:24:17,040
up

3682
02:24:17,040 --> 02:24:17,760
so

3683
02:24:17,760 --> 02:24:20,080
that's 125 pips

3684
02:24:20,080 --> 02:24:21,960
you'd be targeting

3685
02:24:21,960 --> 02:24:25,359
125 pips

3686
02:24:25,760 --> 02:24:27,760
like that

3687
02:24:27,760 --> 02:24:30,960
and although this can hit yes there's a

3688
02:24:30,960 --> 02:24:33,439
possibility that it does

3689
02:24:33,439 --> 02:24:35,120
this

3690
02:24:35,120 --> 02:24:37,600
and the rules behind this had nothing to

3691
02:24:37,600 --> 02:24:39,520
do with structure

3692
02:24:39,520 --> 02:24:41,040
so you could find that you end up

3693
02:24:41,040 --> 02:24:43,600
getting stopped out most times because

3694
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:46,000
you don't understand what's going on

3695
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,680
with structure and you're just drawing

3696
02:24:47,680 --> 02:24:49,439
these everywhere

3697
02:24:49,439 --> 02:24:51,120
you know and these are the things that

3698
02:24:51,120 --> 02:24:53,359
you know like mamba fx and all these

3699
02:24:53,359 --> 02:24:55,520
different traders this is the stuff that

3700
02:24:55,520 --> 02:24:57,680
they they teach people

3701
02:24:57,680 --> 02:24:58,960
you know and

3702
02:24:58,960 --> 02:25:00,319
they're teaching people based on these

3703
02:25:00,319 --> 02:25:02,240
patterns based on the the patterns that

3704
02:25:02,240 --> 02:25:03,200
they know

3705
02:25:03,200 --> 02:25:04,479
you know remember i said price can

3706
02:25:04,479 --> 02:25:06,960
return back to an area a second time and

3707
02:25:06,960 --> 02:25:08,720
possibly get rejected if it gets

3708
02:25:08,720 --> 02:25:10,960
rejected then it ends up running the

3709
02:25:10,960 --> 02:25:13,040
lows if it pushes

3710
02:25:13,040 --> 02:25:15,200
you know above the area then it ends up

3711
02:25:15,200 --> 02:25:16,479
um

3712
02:25:16,479 --> 02:25:18,800
you know continuing higher to

3713
02:25:18,800 --> 02:25:21,439
a possible unmitigated area above

3714
02:25:21,439 --> 02:25:22,399
um

3715
02:25:22,399 --> 02:25:24,240
but yeah this is the stuff that they

3716
02:25:24,240 --> 02:25:25,359
teach

3717
02:25:25,359 --> 02:25:28,240
um newer traders and it's like yeah

3718
02:25:28,240 --> 02:25:30,720
watch me flip this account from from ten

3719
02:25:30,720 --> 02:25:33,760
dollars to to thirty thousand

3720
02:25:33,760 --> 02:25:35,359
and they're doing little things like

3721
02:25:35,359 --> 02:25:37,520
this and it's like

3722
02:25:37,520 --> 02:25:40,560

becomes into like marketing and and just

3750
02:26:43,359 --> 02:26:45,600
like all of these different things that

3751
02:26:45,600 --> 02:26:46,960
they have

3752
02:26:46,960 --> 02:26:48,640
you know running off of

3753
02:26:48,640 --> 02:26:50,240
this one trade that they caught back

3754
02:26:50,240 --> 02:26:51,439
testing

3755
02:26:51,439 --> 02:26:52,800
and you didn't even forward test it they

3756
02:26:52,800 --> 02:26:54,640
caught it back testing

3757
02:26:54,640 --> 02:26:57,120
and they'll photoshop numbers to show

3758
02:26:57,120 --> 02:26:58,720
the videos and then when you listen to

3759
02:26:58,720 --> 02:27:01,200
people who are actually in their groups

3760
02:27:01,200 --> 02:27:03,600
it's like nah they barely be calling

3761
02:27:03,600 --> 02:27:06,560
profitable trades

3762
02:27:07,120 --> 02:27:09,120
you know so it's like little things like

3763
02:27:09,120 --> 02:27:11,120
that

3764
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:13,760
and and all of this risk for just one

3765
02:27:13,760 --> 02:27:17,840
trade like nah bro not happening with me

3766
02:27:17,840 --> 02:27:19,840
because you see how this was

3767
02:27:19,840 --> 02:27:22,080
you know this did indeed push back up up

3768
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:23,840
there

3769
02:27:23,840 --> 02:27:26,080
this

3770
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:28,960
the zone is here

3771
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:31,840
right here

3772
02:27:32,800 --> 02:27:34,000
that's where it's at and this is the

3773
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:35,680
second entry

3774
02:27:35,680 --> 02:27:38,399
the first entry is here

3775
02:27:38,399 --> 02:27:41,359
and the stop is behind here 15 pips

3776
02:27:41,359 --> 02:27:43,760
if you were to take the second entry

3777
02:27:43,760 --> 02:27:45,760
the second entry is here

3778
02:27:45,760 --> 02:27:48,880
stops behind here 17 pips

3779
02:27:48,880 --> 02:27:51,200
why would i have 50 something

3780
02:27:51,200 --> 02:27:55,040
pips on a trade like this

3781
02:27:55,120 --> 02:27:57,359
because i'm utilizing whatever lines

3782
02:27:57,359 --> 02:28:01,359
that it showed me and it did whatever no

3783
02:28:01,520 --> 02:28:04,080
this this not how anybody should be

3784
02:28:04,080 --> 02:28:05,760
trading that's not the way i trade and

3785
02:28:05,760 --> 02:28:07,840
that's that's not the way i expect

3786
02:28:07,840 --> 02:28:10,720
anybody to trade because like i said

3787
02:28:10,720 --> 02:28:14,240
still absence of structure

3788
02:28:14,240 --> 02:28:15,760
absent of structure

3789
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:18,399
you did not give any indication as to

3790
02:28:18,399 --> 02:28:19,600
why

3791
02:28:19,600 --> 02:28:21,920
price was moving back in that direction

3792
02:28:21,920 --> 02:28:24,000
oh i saw all of this sell and sell and

3793
02:28:24,000 --> 02:28:26,240
selling followed by this buying buying

3794
02:28:26,240 --> 02:28:27,680
buying so there's a lot of buying

3795
02:28:27,680 --> 02:28:30,800
pressure and i took my fibs and i went

3796
02:28:30,800 --> 02:28:34,399
and and you know just mapped it out and

3797
02:28:34,399 --> 02:28:35,200
it

3798
02:28:35,200 --> 02:28:37,760
let me let me show you guys

3799
02:28:37,760 --> 02:28:41,680
it hit the 61.8

3800
02:28:41,680 --> 02:28:44,479
and then we ride from there

3801
02:28:44,479 --> 02:28:46,160
saw a little resistance coming out of

3802
02:28:46,160 --> 02:28:48,399
here so i got out and took my order out

3803
02:28:48,399 --> 02:28:49,359
and

3804
02:28:49,359 --> 02:28:51,920
you know let the chat know close the oil

3805
02:28:51,920 --> 02:28:53,600
here manually

3806
02:28:53,600 --> 02:28:55,439
in a mouth this is what they do all the

3807
02:28:55,439 --> 02:28:56,399
time

3808
02:28:56,399 --> 02:28:57,600
it's like

3809
02:28:57,600 --> 02:28:59,840
what do you guys eat like

3810
02:28:59,840 --> 02:29:02,160
you didn't even give reasons for why you

3811
02:29:02,160 --> 02:29:06,240
took the tray from from that direction

3812
02:29:06,399 --> 02:29:09,840
you didn't like nothing

3813
02:29:10,000 --> 02:29:12,880
and then look the potential 125 pips

3814
02:29:12,880 --> 02:29:14,399
trade

3815
02:29:14,399 --> 02:29:18,399
only went 123 or 120

3816
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:19,359
and then

3817
02:29:19,359 --> 02:29:21,120
it's tanking again and then what it

3818
02:29:21,120 --> 02:29:22,720
comes back and take you out any stop

3819
02:29:22,720 --> 02:29:25,160
loss if if price is actually going here

3820
02:29:25,160 --> 02:29:27,200
[Music]

3821
02:29:27,200 --> 02:29:29,680
and we're just believing all of that

3822
02:29:29,680 --> 02:29:31,359
stuff that they're teaching

3823
02:29:31,359 --> 02:29:33,359
and all of it is wrong

3824
02:29:33,359 --> 02:29:37,200
we just end up being liquidity

3825
02:29:37,200 --> 02:29:39,600
because we're using pieces of these

3826
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:42,960
things and not understanding that

3827
02:29:42,960 --> 02:29:44,720
structure and supply and demand is the

3828
02:29:44,720 --> 02:29:47,760
only thing that the market moves on

3829
02:29:47,760 --> 02:29:52,080
structure and supply and demand the only

3830
02:29:52,080 --> 02:29:53,520
thing

3831
02:29:53,520 --> 02:29:55,920
fractals are smds from a lower time

3832
02:29:55,920 --> 02:29:57,120
frame

3833
02:29:57,120 --> 02:29:59,760
you can just see it on this time frame

3834
02:29:59,760 --> 02:30:01,359
but it's from a lower time frame look at

3835
02:30:01,359 --> 02:30:02,880
look at what frac look at what fractals

3836
02:30:02,880 --> 02:30:05,040
are let me show you guys

3837
02:30:05,040 --> 02:30:06,479
let me show you guys what oh and this

3838
02:30:06,479 --> 02:30:09,200
this is a good um

3839
02:30:09,200 --> 02:30:10,960
picture i this is what i used to fall

3840
02:30:10,960 --> 02:30:13,600
asleep with in my hand this

3841
02:30:13,600 --> 02:30:15,439
this is why golf

3842
02:30:15,439 --> 02:30:17,840
buying climax ar

3843
02:30:17,840 --> 02:30:20,319
sound of weakness in phase b ut

3844
02:30:20,319 --> 02:30:22,160
utah

3845
02:30:22,160 --> 02:30:26,479
test of the u-tad and then you get the

3846
02:30:26,479 --> 02:30:27,840
the movement down

3847
02:30:27,840 --> 02:30:29,760
it's a couple areas that it leaves for

3848
02:30:29,760 --> 02:30:31,359
you to join

3849
02:30:31,359 --> 02:30:33,920
and then it has the mark down and it

3850
02:30:33,920 --> 02:30:36,640
marks down all the way into

3851
02:30:36,640 --> 02:30:38,880
accumulation

3852
02:30:38,880 --> 02:30:40,720
so you see the preliminary support you

3853
02:30:40,720 --> 02:30:43,040
see selling climax ar

3854
02:30:43,040 --> 02:30:45,359
secondary test

3855
02:30:45,359 --> 02:30:47,200
then we break the ar

3856
02:30:47,200 --> 02:30:50,000
then we come down to break

3857
02:30:50,000 --> 02:30:52,080
both the secondary tests and the selling

3858
02:30:52,080 --> 02:30:55,359
climax then we push back up

3859
02:30:55,359 --> 02:30:58,319
as if we're going higher

3860
02:30:58,319 --> 02:30:59,359
and then

3861
02:30:59,359 --> 02:31:01,840
we come down

3862
02:31:01,840 --> 02:31:04,160
we come down and run the low

3863
02:31:04,160 --> 02:31:06,720
and after we run the low we come up we

3864
02:31:06,720 --> 02:31:08,000
test

3865
02:31:08,000 --> 02:31:09,280
the spring

3866
02:31:09,280 --> 02:31:11,280
we run all the lows actually not just

3867
02:31:11,280 --> 02:31:13,680
this low but this low too well this

3868
02:31:13,680 --> 02:31:15,439
already liquidated and then this

3869
02:31:15,439 --> 02:31:17,359
liquidated that low remember what i said

3870
02:31:17,359 --> 02:31:19,680
to you guys i said that

3871
02:31:19,680 --> 02:31:21,920
oftentimes you see it to where the lows

3872
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:25,359
get manipulated before trading higher

3873
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:27,760
or the highs get manipulated before

3874
02:31:27,760 --> 02:31:29,439
trading lower

3875
02:31:29,439 --> 02:31:30,479
so

3876
02:31:30,479 --> 02:31:32,240
white golf won't look like this every

3877
02:31:32,240 --> 02:31:35,520
time this is a nice presentation of it

3878
02:31:35,520 --> 02:31:37,280
but there's two different schematics it

3879
02:31:37,280 --> 02:31:39,200
could look different it could look ugly

3880
02:31:39,200 --> 02:31:40,960
it could look sideways

3881
02:31:40,960 --> 02:31:42,640
it doesn't always look like a straight

3882
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:45,280
through consolidation like this

3883
02:31:45,280 --> 02:31:47,760
so we could look sideways

3884
02:31:47,760 --> 02:31:49,600
and then when you look within here you

3885
02:31:49,600 --> 02:31:51,520
see what double bottom

3886
02:31:51,520 --> 02:31:53,600
tap here we go up

3887
02:31:53,600 --> 02:31:55,040
tap here

3888
02:31:55,040 --> 02:31:56,800
they say get in at the neckline break of

3889
02:31:56,800 --> 02:31:58,880
the double bottom which is right here at

3890
02:31:58,880 --> 02:32:00,399
the top of this

3891
02:32:00,399 --> 02:32:01,760
takes you in

3892
02:32:01,760 --> 02:32:04,160
runs your stop loss behind

3893
02:32:04,160 --> 02:32:06,960
the double bottom

3894
02:32:06,960 --> 02:32:08,720
takes you back up

3895
02:32:08,720 --> 02:32:11,600
okay yeah we're making a um

3896
02:32:11,600 --> 02:32:14,240
inverse head and shoulders

3897
02:32:14,240 --> 02:32:16,160
you know you you getting on the neckline

3898
02:32:16,160 --> 02:32:17,200
break

3899
02:32:17,200 --> 02:32:19,359
takes you up some

3900
02:32:19,359 --> 02:32:21,600
runs your stop-loss behind either the

3901
02:32:21,600 --> 02:32:26,399
shoulder or the head runs it

3902
02:32:26,399 --> 02:32:27,600
and then

3903
02:32:27,600 --> 02:32:29,760
takes you up oh but i thought it was

3904
02:32:29,760 --> 02:32:31,520
going up it hit my stop loss and then

3905
02:32:31,520 --> 02:32:32,240
went

3906
02:32:32,240 --> 02:32:33,760
oh but i thought it was going up and hit

3907
02:32:33,760 --> 02:32:35,760
my stop loss and then went they know

3908
02:32:35,760 --> 02:32:38,399
that this is our psychology this is our

3909
02:32:38,399 --> 02:32:40,880
behavior

3910
02:32:40,880 --> 02:32:41,840
and

3911
02:32:41,840 --> 02:32:44,399
the market just plays on that

3912
02:32:44,399 --> 02:32:46,080
it's like the little guy with the cup he

3913
02:32:46,080 --> 02:32:47,680
play he puts certain things under the

3914
02:32:47,680 --> 02:32:49,120
cup and he's like

3915
02:32:49,120 --> 02:32:51,840
mixing it around you know and you swore

3916
02:32:51,840 --> 02:32:55,040
it was that one you saw it under that

3917
02:32:55,040 --> 02:32:56,800
he opens it up

3918
02:32:56,800 --> 02:33:00,000
give me a dollar you wrong

3919
02:33:00,800 --> 02:33:02,960
that's what they do with the movement of

3920
02:33:02,960 --> 02:33:04,880
the market

3921
02:33:04,880 --> 02:33:07,760
this is essentially human behavior

3922
02:33:07,760 --> 02:33:09,520
because look when we get up here and

3923
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:11,359
we're getting ready to run this high

3924
02:33:11,359 --> 02:33:12,560
right here

3925
02:33:12,560 --> 02:33:15,280
we get up here what are we doing we're

3926
02:33:15,280 --> 02:33:17,040
jumping in to try and get in with the

3927
02:33:17,040 --> 02:33:19,760
continuation of it

3928
02:33:19,760 --> 02:33:21,280
nope

3929
02:33:21,280 --> 02:33:22,880
we push back

3930
02:33:22,880 --> 02:33:25,600
random low

3931
02:33:26,399 --> 02:33:29,200
ain't that wild

3932
02:33:29,280 --> 02:33:31,920
then it looks like oh it's just a larger

3933
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:36,960
double double bottom with a um

3934
02:33:36,960 --> 02:33:38,000
uh

3935
02:33:38,000 --> 02:33:41,920
with one leg shorter than the next

3936
02:33:42,080 --> 02:33:45,359
so let me get in on a neckline break

3937
02:33:45,359 --> 02:33:47,600
this breaks this is the neckline break

3938
02:33:47,600 --> 02:33:48,960
across here

3939
02:33:48,960 --> 02:33:53,200
you get in whoop take you back that way

3940
02:33:53,200 --> 02:33:54,880
oh this is the inverse head and shoulder

3941
02:33:54,880 --> 02:33:56,160
i mean this is the head and shoulders

3942
02:33:56,160 --> 02:33:57,680
forming

3943
02:33:57,680 --> 02:34:00,080
let me get in on the neckline break this

3944
02:34:00,080 --> 02:34:02,240
takes me in down on the neckline break

3945
02:34:02,240 --> 02:34:03,200
right here

3946
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:05,760
takes me into the neckline break

3947
02:34:05,760 --> 02:34:08,160
up here

3948
02:34:08,560 --> 02:34:10,479
this is what i'm saying you can't trade

3949
02:34:10,479 --> 02:34:12,720
these these things without understanding

3950
02:34:12,720 --> 02:34:14,000
structure

3951
02:34:14,000 --> 02:34:16,080
because you see how it's just made to

3952
02:34:16,080 --> 02:34:18,080
fake you out all this is exactly how the

3953
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:19,520
market moves

3954
02:34:19,520 --> 02:34:21,520
in in consolidation before a huge

3955
02:34:21,520 --> 02:34:23,439
breakout

3956
02:34:23,439 --> 02:34:25,040
and this is

3957
02:34:25,040 --> 02:34:28,479
what traders are getting involved in

3958
02:34:28,479 --> 02:34:30,560
this is what they're using to to trade

3959
02:34:30,560 --> 02:34:32,640
with but back to a fractal i was

3960
02:34:32,640 --> 02:34:34,720
mentioned i have mentioned that um look

3961
02:34:34,720 --> 02:34:36,479
this is a fractal

3962
02:34:36,479 --> 02:34:38,000
this right here

3963
02:34:38,000 --> 02:34:39,200
this low

3964
02:34:39,200 --> 02:34:40,479
this high

3965
02:34:40,479 --> 02:34:44,240
and the price trades away from it

3966
02:34:44,240 --> 02:34:46,880
so you see that

3967
02:34:47,120 --> 02:34:50,000
we take this wick to this wick

3968
02:34:50,000 --> 02:34:52,640
place a square over it whatever it is

3969
02:34:52,640 --> 02:34:54,240
mind you there's this square down here

3970
02:34:54,240 --> 02:34:56,960
from a lower time frame fractal

3971
02:34:56,960 --> 02:34:59,359
but when you open up the fractal

3972
02:34:59,359 --> 02:35:02,610
on a lower time frame look at what it is

3973
02:35:02,610 --> 02:35:05,200
[Music]

3974
02:35:05,200 --> 02:35:07,760
you see that

3975
02:35:08,410 --> 02:35:10,560
[Music]

3976
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:13,280
this is what it is

3977
02:35:13,280 --> 02:35:16,560
all it is is a zone with

3978
02:35:16,560 --> 02:35:19,280
smds in it

3979
02:35:19,280 --> 02:35:22,240
which ones are more likely

3980
02:35:22,240 --> 02:35:25,280
could be the tap within this area

3981
02:35:25,280 --> 02:35:29,120
could be the one up in this area here

3982
02:35:29,200 --> 02:35:31,520
this wick this wick we know it's not

3983
02:35:31,520 --> 02:35:34,640
this because this is already mitigated

3984
02:35:34,640 --> 02:35:38,319
could be this entire candle here

3985
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:42,880
could react anywhere within this area

3986
02:35:43,920 --> 02:35:45,510
but that's why we get

3987
02:35:45,510 --> 02:35:46,640
[Music]

3988
02:35:46,640 --> 02:35:48,000
the

3989
02:35:48,000 --> 02:35:48,960
touch

3990
02:35:48,960 --> 02:35:52,399
oftentimes of the fractal

3991
02:35:52,399 --> 02:35:54,240
and sometimes it's the s and d that's

3992
02:35:54,240 --> 02:35:56,160
above here

3993
02:35:56,160 --> 02:35:58,560
but there are s ds inside of the

3994
02:35:58,560 --> 02:36:00,560
fractals as well

3995
02:36:00,560 --> 02:36:03,280
and that's

3996
02:36:03,280 --> 02:36:07,200
why i talk about fractals the way i do

3997
02:36:07,840 --> 02:36:09,200
because

3998
02:36:09,200 --> 02:36:12,720
they are smds on a lower time frame

3999
02:36:12,720 --> 02:36:14,640
and it just becomes easier for you to

4000
02:36:14,640 --> 02:36:16,800
spot a smaller smd so when you see when

4001
02:36:16,800 --> 02:36:18,960
price quickly turns around from a

4002
02:36:18,960 --> 02:36:20,880
particular area and you're trying to

4003
02:36:20,880 --> 02:36:23,439
figure out wait what the hell why did it

4004
02:36:23,439 --> 02:36:26,160
why did it hit that area

4005
02:36:26,160 --> 02:36:29,040
look we went below this s and d

4006
02:36:29,040 --> 02:36:31,520
to where

4007
02:36:33,920 --> 02:36:37,720
down within this one

4008
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:42,560
down within this one right here

4009
02:36:46,000 --> 02:36:47,600
what's the next

4010
02:36:47,600 --> 02:36:49,439
buy or sell

4011
02:36:49,439 --> 02:36:52,479
um it's whichever one you choose

4012
02:36:52,479 --> 02:36:54,319
um but you got to learn the concepts

4013
02:36:54,319 --> 02:36:55,680
first

4014
02:36:55,680 --> 02:36:56,960
whichever buy and sell you want to

4015
02:36:56,960 --> 02:36:58,960
choose you can choose on your on your

4016
02:36:58,960 --> 02:37:00,800
metatrader on your phone

4017
02:37:00,800 --> 02:37:02,399
i'm not going to tell you where to buy

4018
02:37:02,399 --> 02:37:03,680
yourself but i'm going to teach you

4019
02:37:03,680 --> 02:37:05,600
concepts of

4020
02:37:05,600 --> 02:37:08,720
how to get in on one

4021
02:37:09,040 --> 02:37:11,760
you know so this validus this area is

4022
02:37:11,760 --> 02:37:14,080
still valid because we haven't put in

4023
02:37:14,080 --> 02:37:16,800
another low yet this low

4024
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:18,399
so you could have multiple rejections

4025
02:37:18,399 --> 02:37:20,880
coming from this area

4026
02:37:20,880 --> 02:37:22,800
because we haven't taken out the low

4027
02:37:22,800 --> 02:37:27,359
neither have we traded through this area

4028
02:37:27,359 --> 02:37:30,640
so this zone still becomes valid

4029
02:37:30,640 --> 02:37:32,800
still remains valid

4030
02:37:32,800 --> 02:37:36,720
and then just right above this area

4031
02:37:36,720 --> 02:37:38,430
right here

4032
02:37:38,430 --> 02:37:41,469
[Music]

4033
02:37:42,319 --> 02:37:45,960
you have this fractal

4034
02:37:48,479 --> 02:37:51,120
this fractal right above

4035
02:37:51,120 --> 02:37:52,479
so remember how i mentioned that

4036
02:37:52,479 --> 02:37:55,600
sometimes you can go through an area and

4037
02:37:55,600 --> 02:37:58,880
wick out of the area and then

4038
02:37:58,880 --> 02:38:00,880
trade below it

4039
02:38:00,880 --> 02:38:02,560
sometimes it's because there's a small

4040
02:38:02,560 --> 02:38:05,359
area just up above it

4041
02:38:05,359 --> 02:38:06,240
that

4042
02:38:06,240 --> 02:38:09,120
you'd often get that tap into before

4043
02:38:09,120 --> 02:38:11,439
leaving

4044
02:38:11,920 --> 02:38:13,520
so that's something that you you guys

4045
02:38:13,520 --> 02:38:15,520
want to you know pay attention to when

4046
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:18,080
you're trading from a specific area

4047
02:38:18,080 --> 02:38:20,080
understand that even if it's pushing

4048
02:38:20,080 --> 02:38:21,760
through the area

4049
02:38:21,760 --> 02:38:25,359
there could be a tap up above it

4050
02:38:25,359 --> 02:38:27,600
tap into that area and then trade back

4051
02:38:27,600 --> 02:38:28,880
underneath

4052
02:38:28,880 --> 02:38:31,280
the area you were trading from

4053
02:38:31,280 --> 02:38:34,240
so that's why i'm not a firm believer in

4054
02:38:34,240 --> 02:38:37,439
in placing limits right here

4055
02:38:37,439 --> 02:38:38,640
and then

4056
02:38:38,640 --> 02:38:41,600
putting your stops behind here

4057
02:38:41,600 --> 02:38:43,280
because a lot of the times

4058
02:38:43,280 --> 02:38:44,800
you might be right

4059
02:38:44,800 --> 02:38:47,200
about where it's going

4060
02:38:47,200 --> 02:38:49,439
but

4061
02:38:49,680 --> 02:38:51,760
there may just be an area just above

4062
02:38:51,760 --> 02:38:53,040
that it

4063
02:38:53,040 --> 02:38:56,240
you know up and wicks you out at

4064
02:38:56,240 --> 02:38:59,680
you know whenever it gets to here

4065
02:38:59,760 --> 02:39:02,000
it can go and tap this area and then

4066
02:39:02,000 --> 02:39:04,800
begin to fall

4067
02:39:05,200 --> 02:39:06,560
and that can kind of look like the

4068
02:39:06,560 --> 02:39:09,280
little stab that happens in that area or

4069
02:39:09,280 --> 02:39:11,359
whatever it is like there's there's

4070
02:39:11,359 --> 02:39:13,280
different things that it could be

4071
02:39:13,280 --> 02:39:15,520
but those are the explanations for why

4072
02:39:15,520 --> 02:39:18,000
that happened so again you could have

4073
02:39:18,000 --> 02:39:21,200
this order here look limit order

4074
02:39:21,200 --> 02:39:23,040
i mean you might be risking 10 pips so

4075
02:39:23,040 --> 02:39:24,720
you might be like you know yeah whatever

4076
02:39:24,720 --> 02:39:26,479
is 10 pips

4077
02:39:26,479 --> 02:39:27,760
you know

4078
02:39:27,760 --> 02:39:29,280
but if this happens to go through the

4079
02:39:29,280 --> 02:39:31,840
area while you're limiting in

4080
02:39:31,840 --> 02:39:34,080
then

4081
02:39:34,240 --> 02:39:36,880
you get stopped out

4082
02:39:36,880 --> 02:39:39,200
because there just might be an area just

4083
02:39:39,200 --> 02:39:41,920
above that price is going to and then it

4084
02:39:41,920 --> 02:39:43,920
pushes out of the area so remember the

4085
02:39:43,920 --> 02:39:45,200
different types of projections that i

4086
02:39:45,200 --> 02:39:46,880
told you about i mentioned it could

4087
02:39:46,880 --> 02:39:48,800
reject here

4088
02:39:48,800 --> 02:39:51,520
at the touch of the zone

4089
02:39:51,520 --> 02:39:52,960
it could reject from the middle of the

4090
02:39:52,960 --> 02:39:54,960
zone and if you look this is 23 pips in

4091
02:39:54,960 --> 02:39:58,399
profit already and then it could flag

4092
02:39:58,399 --> 02:40:00,640
through the top of the zone to tap into

4093
02:40:00,640 --> 02:40:03,040
an area above and then close back within

4094
02:40:03,040 --> 02:40:04,160
the zone

4095
02:40:04,160 --> 02:40:05,680
and that could also be your rejection as

4096
02:40:05,680 --> 02:40:07,840
well

4097
02:40:08,880 --> 02:40:12,000
a little minor imbalance within here

4098
02:40:12,000 --> 02:40:14,960
um that price could react off of here

4099
02:40:14,960 --> 02:40:17,120
i can just continue down to this s and d

4100
02:40:17,120 --> 02:40:18,000
here

4101
02:40:18,000 --> 02:40:19,600
you know this

4102
02:40:19,600 --> 02:40:22,319
smd right here

4103
02:40:22,319 --> 02:40:24,160
but this is exactly what i'm talking

4104
02:40:24,160 --> 02:40:26,720
about when you understand these things

4105
02:40:26,720 --> 02:40:27,680
then

4106
02:40:27,680 --> 02:40:30,240
it gives you the ability to react with

4107
02:40:30,240 --> 02:40:32,080
them

4108
02:40:32,080 --> 02:40:33,439
so it's like okay

4109
02:40:33,439 --> 02:40:38,720
tapped here long wick rejected away cool

4110
02:40:38,720 --> 02:40:40,160
i'm looking to jump in on this and

4111
02:40:40,160 --> 02:40:42,240
possibly take it wherever it might be

4112
02:40:42,240 --> 02:40:44,399
going

4113
02:40:44,399 --> 02:40:46,399
and that could happen just that fast

4114
02:40:46,399 --> 02:40:48,720
like that just that fast this is 58 pips

4115
02:40:48,720 --> 02:40:52,640
already 60 pips just that fast

4116
02:40:52,640 --> 02:40:55,600
it happens like that

4117
02:40:55,760 --> 02:40:57,439
yeah and this could potentially come

4118
02:40:57,439 --> 02:40:59,680
into this area or run the low

4119
02:40:59,680 --> 02:41:02,160
i think it could run the low if it

4120
02:41:02,160 --> 02:41:05,840
doesn't get rejected out of this area

4121
02:41:10,080 --> 02:41:12,640
look at that

4122
02:41:12,960 --> 02:41:14,479
and this is just me

4123
02:41:14,479 --> 02:41:16,560
telling telling you guys a trade that

4124
02:41:16,560 --> 02:41:19,520

happy that uh

4143
02:42:10,880 --> 02:42:14,399
you're in forex um

4144
02:42:14,479 --> 02:42:18,880
it's this is gonna take off this is

4145
02:42:18,880 --> 02:42:20,960
this is a very very new

4146
02:42:20,960 --> 02:42:23,600
thing that i'm teaching um some of the

4147
02:42:23,600 --> 02:42:24,800
concepts are

4148
02:42:24,800 --> 02:42:25,600
um

4149
02:42:25,600 --> 02:42:27,359
still out there but they're not taught

4150
02:42:27,359 --> 02:42:29,600
the way that i teach it this is supply

4151
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:32,479
and demand on crack on steroids

4152
02:42:32,479 --> 02:42:34,560
um you see i said i could tap into this

4153
02:42:34,560 --> 02:42:35,680
because

4154
02:42:35,680 --> 02:42:37,439
this whole thing wasn't mitigated look

4155
02:42:37,439 --> 02:42:39,359
at how we got the tap and we immediately

4156
02:42:39,359 --> 02:42:42,880
jet it back up to this

4157
02:42:44,800 --> 02:42:46,720
i told you these are targets to take

4158
02:42:46,720 --> 02:42:49,840
profit and entries

4159
02:42:50,880 --> 02:42:53,120
so now you understand like

4160
02:42:53,120 --> 02:42:55,600
you know look at this tap back into

4161
02:42:55,600 --> 02:42:56,960
there let's say you got out of your

4162
02:42:56,960 --> 02:42:58,880
short there and got into a long from

4163
02:42:58,880 --> 02:43:00,800
there

4164
02:43:00,800 --> 02:43:02,319
right here

4165
02:43:02,319 --> 02:43:04,560
back up into

4166
02:43:04,560 --> 02:43:09,279
this area or running the highs

4167
02:43:09,279 --> 02:43:11,760
back up into like the the middle of this

4168
02:43:11,760 --> 02:43:14,880
area here

4169
02:43:20,640 --> 02:43:23,359
stops behind the zone only a 19 pip stop

4170
02:43:23,359 --> 02:43:24,399
because that's what you would have

4171
02:43:24,399 --> 02:43:26,560
mentally you tap there

4172
02:43:26,560 --> 02:43:29,200
and then look

4173
02:43:30,319 --> 02:43:33,359
out of this area showing where to

4174
02:43:33,359 --> 02:43:34,640
possibly

4175
02:43:34,640 --> 02:43:37,680
hear you know maybe

4176
02:43:37,680 --> 02:43:40,720
stops behind there

4177
02:43:44,720 --> 02:43:46,560
yo

4178
02:43:46,560 --> 02:43:49,520
this is like so crazy and

4179
02:43:49,520 --> 02:43:51,439
and you can do this each and every time

4180
02:43:51,439 --> 02:43:54,080
look at that

4181
02:43:55,279 --> 02:43:57,840
look at that

4182
02:43:57,840 --> 02:44:02,640
66 pips 63 pips back up

4183
02:44:02,640 --> 02:44:04,479
and maybe this is going to the middle of

4184
02:44:04,479 --> 02:44:06,399
this area who knows or this can come

4185
02:44:06,399 --> 02:44:08,560
further down to this area who knows you

4186
02:44:08,560 --> 02:44:09,520
know

4187
02:44:09,520 --> 02:44:12,240
but look at that three trades

4188
02:44:12,240 --> 02:44:14,640
right in front of you guys

4189
02:44:14,640 --> 02:44:17,120
nobody can't talk to me about like the

4190
02:44:17,120 --> 02:44:19,800
the lack of um

4191
02:44:19,800 --> 02:44:22,240
transparency or or anything like that

4192
02:44:22,240 --> 02:44:22,960
like

4193
02:44:22,960 --> 02:44:25,920
we we just watched

4194
02:44:25,920 --> 02:44:27,359
this happen

4195
02:44:27,359 --> 02:44:28,960
we just watched this happen like

4196
02:44:28,960 --> 02:44:32,960
literally right in front of us

4197
02:44:32,960 --> 02:44:35,840
so if people were to measure

4198
02:44:35,840 --> 02:44:38,720
any type of

4199
02:44:38,960 --> 02:44:40,560
you know like like

4200
02:44:40,560 --> 02:44:43,600
whether it's it's

4201
02:44:43,680 --> 02:44:45,200
you know oh you don't know what you're

4202
02:44:45,200 --> 02:44:46,960
doing you know you know what you're

4203
02:44:46,960 --> 02:44:49,040
talking about you know there's all of

4204
02:44:49,040 --> 02:44:51,040
that look this is back up into the area

4205
02:44:51,040 --> 02:44:53,439
by the way

4206
02:44:54,080 --> 02:44:56,560
back up into the area

4207
02:44:56,560 --> 02:44:59,840
and stops will be behind the zone

4208
02:44:59,840 --> 02:45:03,600
at these stops 19 pips 14 pips 10 pips

4209
02:45:03,600 --> 02:45:05,600
9 pips look at this and this could be

4210
02:45:05,600 --> 02:45:08,479
running a high maybe

4211
02:45:08,640 --> 02:45:10,399
bam

4212
02:45:10,399 --> 02:45:12,240
that's what i'm saying like

4213
02:45:12,240 --> 02:45:14,479
i can adjust very

4214
02:45:14,479 --> 02:45:15,680
fast

4215
02:45:15,680 --> 02:45:17,920
to a market like this

4216
02:45:17,920 --> 02:45:21,840
very very very fast if i wanted to just

4217
02:45:21,840 --> 02:45:24,160
trade all of this we run the high we

4218
02:45:24,160 --> 02:45:26,479
potentially have a rejection from there

4219
02:45:26,479 --> 02:45:28,800
back down to maybe here

4220
02:45:28,800 --> 02:45:31,279
you know or maybe just to the middle of

4221
02:45:31,279 --> 02:45:33,120
this area and then

4222
02:45:33,120 --> 02:45:35,200
we go

4223
02:45:35,200 --> 02:45:37,200
but these things like

4224
02:45:37,200 --> 02:45:39,439
i don't know anybody that

4225
02:45:39,439 --> 02:45:40,880
that uh

4226
02:45:40,880 --> 02:45:42,880
hey dave can i get a screenshot of the

4227
02:45:42,880 --> 02:45:44,479
top down impossible

4228
02:45:44,479 --> 02:45:49,040
just real quick okay yeah yeah let me um

4229
02:45:49,200 --> 02:45:51,040
go out did i did i do the top down on

4230
02:45:51,040 --> 02:45:52,000
here

4231
02:45:52,000 --> 02:45:55,439
oh yeah but i didn't mark these areas

4232
02:45:55,439 --> 02:45:58,160
so um

4233
02:45:58,880 --> 02:46:01,120
our top down was

4234
02:46:01,120 --> 02:46:02,880
you know potentially

4235
02:46:02,880 --> 02:46:04,800
um reacting from these areas but this

4236
02:46:04,800 --> 02:46:06,880
was the first area that we had

4237
02:46:06,880 --> 02:46:09,600
right here let me go to the hourly it

4238
02:46:09,600 --> 02:46:11,920
might show a little better

4239
02:46:11,920 --> 02:46:14,479
yeah this was the daily low that we were

4240
02:46:14,479 --> 02:46:15,439
running

4241
02:46:15,439 --> 02:46:18,000
so i said after we run the daily low we

4242
02:46:18,000 --> 02:46:20,640
usually get a huge pump up

4243
02:46:20,640 --> 02:46:22,000
um

4244
02:46:22,000 --> 02:46:25,840
and where did it pump back to

4245
02:46:25,840 --> 02:46:27,920
you know this area here

4246
02:46:27,920 --> 02:46:29,279
and i think i had mentioned that this

4247
02:46:29,279 --> 02:46:31,279
area was the area that um it was going

4248
02:46:31,279 --> 02:46:32,880
to come to but i think i mentioned that

4249
02:46:32,880 --> 02:46:34,800
on nas

4250
02:46:34,800 --> 02:46:36,240
um

4251
02:46:36,240 --> 02:46:37,680
but yeah

4252
02:46:37,680 --> 02:46:40,319
it was this um we have some other areas

4253
02:46:40,319 --> 02:46:42,399
down here these are just areas where

4254
02:46:42,399 --> 02:46:45,120
price can tap and reverse again these

4255
02:46:45,120 --> 02:46:48,000
these are not areas to um

4256
02:46:48,000 --> 02:46:49,600
hit to scalp

4257
02:46:49,600 --> 02:46:51,520
let me open this up a little more these

4258
02:46:51,520 --> 02:46:53,840
are not areas to that it hits and you

4259
02:46:53,840 --> 02:46:55,600
could scalp on because these are from

4260
02:46:55,600 --> 02:46:57,920
higher time frames so

4261
02:46:57,920 --> 02:46:59,200
the wicks

4262
02:46:59,200 --> 02:47:00,960
could travel through this it could

4263
02:47:00,960 --> 02:47:03,040
travel through this whole thing here tap

4264
02:47:03,040 --> 02:47:05,600
into this and push back up

4265
02:47:05,600 --> 02:47:07,520
and you just see a wick on a higher time

4266
02:47:07,520 --> 02:47:08,960
frame

4267
02:47:08,960 --> 02:47:10,399
but you might have

4268
02:47:10,399 --> 02:47:12,479
taken the tap of this and ended up in

4269
02:47:12,479 --> 02:47:14,479
drawdown all the way to here

4270
02:47:14,479 --> 02:47:15,920
130

4271
02:47:15,920 --> 02:47:17,520
you don't want that

4272
02:47:17,520 --> 02:47:20,720
so yeah the these were just um uh higher

4273
02:47:20,720 --> 02:47:22,640
time frame areas

4274
02:47:22,640 --> 02:47:24,800
that we selected and we said that

4275
02:47:24,800 --> 02:47:27,120
there's their um possible reversal

4276
02:47:27,120 --> 02:47:30,000
points and this is a daily low let me

4277
02:47:30,000 --> 02:47:32,840
actually make this

4278
02:47:32,840 --> 02:47:35,920
red this is a low

4279
02:47:35,920 --> 02:47:37,439
a daily low

4280
02:47:37,439 --> 02:47:40,319
so if this low is ran we could expect a

4281
02:47:40,319 --> 02:47:43,760
huge pump up after this low is ran

4282
02:47:43,760 --> 02:47:45,920
but again this is a low so

4283
02:47:45,920 --> 02:47:49,279
it would essentially be a pump up to

4284
02:47:49,279 --> 02:47:51,760
retrace and potentially continue back

4285
02:47:51,760 --> 02:47:54,080
down below it

4286
02:47:54,080 --> 02:47:57,040
so um that's just uh

4287
02:47:57,040 --> 02:47:59,040
something that you want to be mindful of

4288
02:47:59,040 --> 02:48:01,359
but i'm explaining it that way

4289
02:48:01,359 --> 02:48:03,040
then you also have

4290
02:48:03,040 --> 02:48:06,479
this high here

4291
02:48:06,720 --> 02:48:10,640
watch for the possibility of

4292
02:48:10,640 --> 02:48:12,479
the run of this high

4293
02:48:12,479 --> 02:48:13,200
but

4294
02:48:13,200 --> 02:48:16,880
really and truly the run of this high

4295
02:48:16,880 --> 02:48:19,200
would give me some indication that

4296
02:48:19,200 --> 02:48:21,439
we could possibly

4297
02:48:21,439 --> 02:48:23,200
try to attack

4298
02:48:23,200 --> 02:48:27,080
this high up here

4299
02:48:33,040 --> 02:48:35,120
right here

4300
02:48:35,120 --> 02:48:37,439
yeah

4301
02:48:37,680 --> 02:48:39,600
that we could possibly let me move this

4302
02:48:39,600 --> 02:48:41,600
here i don't remember why this was oh

4303
02:48:41,600 --> 02:48:42,840
this was

4304
02:48:42,840 --> 02:48:46,640
um the uh thing

4305
02:48:46,880 --> 02:48:48,399
the

4306
02:48:48,399 --> 02:48:50,399
the little um

4307
02:48:50,399 --> 02:48:52,560
imbalance feel that's what that line was

4308
02:48:52,560 --> 02:48:55,840
but yeah if we if we run this high

4309
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:58,000
there's a possibility that we could be

4310
02:48:58,000 --> 02:48:59,279
looking to

4311
02:48:59,279 --> 02:49:00,880
get up to this one

4312
02:49:00,880 --> 02:49:01,840
up here

4313
02:49:01,840 --> 02:49:05,680
so these are just targets that are above

4314
02:49:05,680 --> 02:49:08,560
um here

4315
02:49:08,640 --> 02:49:11,640
here

4316
02:49:17,120 --> 02:49:18,960
and this is what i'm usually doing after

4317
02:49:18,960 --> 02:49:20,560
stream

4318
02:49:20,560 --> 02:49:22,800
um

4319
02:49:23,279 --> 02:49:27,640
you know oftentimes uh

4320
02:49:27,760 --> 02:49:29,279
place these here

4321
02:49:29,279 --> 02:49:31,920
and look at how price reacts to some of

4322
02:49:31,920 --> 02:49:33,279
these

4323
02:49:33,279 --> 02:49:37,520
so here within these areas here

4324
02:49:38,479 --> 02:49:40,399
yes because all of this the reason why i

4325
02:49:40,399 --> 02:49:42,240
have this and then this

4326
02:49:42,240 --> 02:49:44,000
is because

4327
02:49:44,000 --> 02:49:46,000
all of this here these candles here are

4328
02:49:46,000 --> 02:49:47,520
mitigated

4329
02:49:47,520 --> 02:49:50,240
this one here didn't get a lot of

4330
02:49:50,240 --> 02:49:51,920
mitigation to it

4331
02:49:51,920 --> 02:49:54,920
um

4332
02:49:55,200 --> 02:49:58,800
let me actually see

4333
02:49:59,760 --> 02:50:01,120
yeah this one didn't get a lot of

4334
02:50:01,120 --> 02:50:02,880
mitigation to it so

4335
02:50:02,880 --> 02:50:06,800
if you do get a rejection from here

4336
02:50:06,800 --> 02:50:10,720
from this line 144 it is valid

4337
02:50:10,720 --> 02:50:12,000
um

4338
02:50:12,000 --> 02:50:14,240
it could be momentary as well

4339
02:50:14,240 --> 02:50:17,520
but it is still um

4340
02:50:17,520 --> 02:50:20,160
valid to potentially have a rejection

4341
02:50:20,160 --> 02:50:22,960
there because um this entire thing

4342
02:50:22,960 --> 02:50:24,880
wasn't mitigated i said i'd like to see

4343
02:50:24,880 --> 02:50:27,279
it mitigated anywhere between like 50 to

4344
02:50:27,279 --> 02:50:29,520
90

4345
02:50:29,520 --> 02:50:30,640
so yeah

4346
02:50:30,640 --> 02:50:33,359
um if if you want to take a a picture of

4347
02:50:33,359 --> 02:50:36,479
this or a screenshot of this you can

4348
02:50:36,479 --> 02:50:37,439
um

4349
02:50:37,439 --> 02:50:39,680
i just wish that see this is where the

4350
02:50:39,680 --> 02:50:41,439
discord becomes important because i

4351
02:50:41,439 --> 02:50:43,439
could do the top down send it right into

4352
02:50:43,439 --> 02:50:44,640
the discord

4353
02:50:44,640 --> 02:50:45,680
and then

4354
02:50:45,680 --> 02:50:47,359
later on just work with the rest of the

4355
02:50:47,359 --> 02:50:50,000
day and people would just be able to get

4356
02:50:50,000 --> 02:50:52,720
it from the discord

4357
02:50:52,720 --> 02:50:55,680
yeah let me just see how nas worked out

4358
02:50:55,680 --> 02:50:57,920
um

4359
02:50:59,120 --> 02:51:00,000
yeah

4360
02:51:00,000 --> 02:51:01,760
you see the same way still gave me the

4361
02:51:01,760 --> 02:51:03,760
rejection at 12 11.

4362
02:51:03,760 --> 02:51:05,840
pulled back into the area

4363
02:51:05,840 --> 02:51:07,200
and then

4364
02:51:07,200 --> 02:51:08,640
continued up

4365
02:51:08,640 --> 02:51:12,920
let me go down to the 15.

4366
02:51:23,520 --> 02:51:25,680
oh my gosh i hope this youtube oh no it

4367
02:51:25,680 --> 02:51:26,640
didn't

4368
02:51:26,640 --> 02:51:29,439
if it goes to the the next uh song

4369
02:51:29,439 --> 02:51:31,359
oftentimes it's like a song that's

4370
02:51:31,359 --> 02:51:33,439
copyrighted already

4371
02:51:33,439 --> 02:51:34,240
um

4372
02:51:34,240 --> 02:51:36,080
and then they end up taking on your

4373
02:51:36,080 --> 02:51:38,240
stream i know sucks right

4374
02:51:38,240 --> 02:51:40,720
so look we had a push above into this

4375
02:51:40,720 --> 02:51:42,640
area and a tap

4376
02:51:42,640 --> 02:51:43,760
up here

4377
02:51:43,760 --> 02:51:46,399
then we got a rejection from this area

4378
02:51:46,399 --> 02:51:47,680
back down

4379
02:51:47,680 --> 02:51:50,479
so this was essentially facilitating

4380
02:51:50,479 --> 02:51:53,200
that push up above the line and then the

4381
02:51:53,200 --> 02:51:55,760
rejection off of it

4382
02:51:55,760 --> 02:51:57,040
and then we

4383
02:51:57,040 --> 02:51:57,840
got

4384
02:51:57,840 --> 02:52:01,760
a push back up to it but remember what i

4385
02:52:01,760 --> 02:52:04,000
was saying

4386
02:52:04,000 --> 02:52:05,200
you see what i was saying we're here

4387
02:52:05,200 --> 02:52:07,040
with this with this head and shoulders

4388
02:52:07,040 --> 02:52:07,920
pattern

4389
02:52:07,920 --> 02:52:11,279
and why it's important not to

4390
02:52:11,279 --> 02:52:12,240
you know

4391
02:52:12,240 --> 02:52:14,399
try to trade these patterns absent of

4392
02:52:14,399 --> 02:52:18,479
structure because if you look right here

4393
02:52:18,479 --> 02:52:20,399
the neckline break you're shorting from

4394
02:52:20,399 --> 02:52:22,000
the neckline break essentially what

4395
02:52:22,000 --> 02:52:23,439
they're telling you and they tell you to

4396
02:52:23,439 --> 02:52:24,960
take it down to

4397
02:52:24,960 --> 02:52:28,080
you know some zone down within here

4398
02:52:28,080 --> 02:52:29,600
let's say you took it down to the zone

4399
02:52:29,600 --> 02:52:31,920
until you place your stops directly

4400
02:52:31,920 --> 02:52:33,840
behind

4401
02:52:33,840 --> 02:52:35,279
the shoulder

4402
02:52:35,279 --> 02:52:36,479
look at this

4403
02:52:36,479 --> 02:52:38,080
out

4404
02:52:38,080 --> 02:52:41,120
47 pips out

4405
02:52:41,120 --> 02:52:42,560
because of

4406
02:52:42,560 --> 02:52:45,359
using a pattern absent of what structure

4407
02:52:45,359 --> 02:52:46,800
is actually doing

4408
02:52:46,800 --> 02:52:48,560
so that's why you you don't want to use

4409
02:52:48,560 --> 02:52:49,520
that

4410
02:52:49,520 --> 02:52:51,279
that's great i'm glad you got the shot

4411
02:52:51,279 --> 02:52:53,200
sean

4412
02:52:53,200 --> 02:52:55,040
yeah that's why you don't

4413
02:52:55,040 --> 02:52:56,800
you don't want to use that and if you

4414
02:52:56,800 --> 02:52:58,000
look here

4415
02:52:58,000 --> 02:53:02,560
um let me actually go to the us30 chart

4416
02:53:03,760 --> 02:53:06,560
if you look here

4417
02:53:06,720 --> 02:53:10,479
see look i told you exactly what i said

4418
02:53:10,479 --> 02:53:12,319
this is why i said you know like when

4419
02:53:12,319 --> 02:53:14,240
you understand order flow like it

4420
02:53:14,240 --> 02:53:15,760
changes

4421
02:53:15,760 --> 02:53:18,800
everything for you so look we tapped up

4422
02:53:18,800 --> 02:53:21,359
into the area a second time

4423
02:53:21,359 --> 02:53:22,840
right

4424
02:53:22,840 --> 02:53:25,840
here but i mean this is this is like

4425
02:53:25,840 --> 02:53:28,640
four or five taps really

4426
02:53:28,640 --> 02:53:30,880
one two three four

4427
02:53:30,880 --> 02:53:31,840
five

4428
02:53:31,840 --> 02:53:33,760
we tapped up into this area a second

4429
02:53:33,760 --> 02:53:34,640
time

4430
02:53:34,640 --> 02:53:38,240
and i said usually when we run the highs

4431
02:53:38,240 --> 02:53:40,479
we usually short

4432
02:53:40,479 --> 02:53:43,600
but this is running the highs with wicks

4433
02:53:43,600 --> 02:53:45,760
no body closures above

4434
02:53:45,760 --> 02:53:47,520
so what do we have that we always talk

4435
02:53:47,520 --> 02:53:48,560
about

4436
02:53:48,560 --> 02:53:50,240
equal highs

4437
02:53:50,240 --> 02:53:53,279
equal highs usually resort and result

4438
02:53:53,279 --> 02:53:56,080
resort result in

4439
02:53:56,080 --> 02:53:58,080
the run of the low

4440
02:53:58,080 --> 02:53:59,600
and we either run

4441
02:53:59,600 --> 02:54:02,800
the first low responsible right here

4442
02:54:02,800 --> 02:54:04,720
for one of the highs

4443
02:54:04,720 --> 02:54:06,560
and possibly the second

4444
02:54:06,560 --> 02:54:08,800
responsible for the other high

4445
02:54:08,800 --> 02:54:11,359
which we got the run here

4446
02:54:11,359 --> 02:54:13,600
but then we also have

4447
02:54:13,600 --> 02:54:15,200
equal highs

4448
02:54:15,200 --> 02:54:16,800
over here

4449
02:54:16,800 --> 02:54:18,479
here here

4450
02:54:18,479 --> 02:54:20,479
here would be included these would be

4451
02:54:20,479 --> 02:54:21,680
included

4452
02:54:21,680 --> 02:54:25,439
so what's happening in this area

4453
02:54:25,439 --> 02:54:27,359
we're getting multiple rejections out of

4454
02:54:27,359 --> 02:54:28,880
this area

4455
02:54:28,880 --> 02:54:30,640
but even though we're getting multiple

4456
02:54:30,640 --> 02:54:32,880
rejections out of this area

4457
02:54:32,880 --> 02:54:36,160
we still have not ran the low

4458
02:54:36,160 --> 02:54:40,319
so that makes this area still a valid

4459
02:54:40,319 --> 02:54:41,520
area

4460
02:54:41,520 --> 02:54:44,560
because we have not ran the low

4461
02:54:44,560 --> 02:54:46,399
this area still becomes valid i said

4462
02:54:46,399 --> 02:54:48,399
this when we were right here look how

4463
02:54:48,399 --> 02:54:50,800
many tops we got into this

4464
02:54:50,800 --> 02:54:53,600
we got one here we got another one here

4465
02:54:53,600 --> 02:54:55,920
we got another one here we got another

4466
02:54:55,920 --> 02:54:58,399
one here

4467
02:54:59,840 --> 02:55:00,840
five

4468
02:55:00,840 --> 02:55:03,840
tops and we rejected away from it each

4469
02:55:03,840 --> 02:55:06,160
time

4470
02:55:08,960 --> 02:55:12,160
because this zone is still valid

4471
02:55:12,160 --> 02:55:14,720
as long as price did not trade up above

4472
02:55:14,720 --> 02:55:17,279
and close or

4473
02:55:17,279 --> 02:55:20,240
give us another low

4474
02:55:21,040 --> 02:55:23,040
so this is what i was saying sometimes

4475
02:55:23,040 --> 02:55:25,840
people see

4476
02:55:26,399 --> 02:55:29,279
they see this consolidation here

4477
02:55:29,279 --> 02:55:31,120
but often times you just have it to

4478
02:55:31,120 --> 02:55:33,120
where it's jumping from zone to zone to

4479
02:55:33,120 --> 02:55:36,800
zone because look this right here

4480
02:55:37,279 --> 02:55:40,000
this right here

4481
02:55:41,760 --> 02:55:42,720
is

4482
02:55:42,720 --> 02:55:46,640
an s d on a higher time frame

4483
02:55:46,880 --> 02:55:48,240
this right here

4484
02:55:48,240 --> 02:55:51,120
on a higher time frame this is the s d

4485
02:55:51,120 --> 02:55:52,960
this is the demand so it's going from

4486
02:55:52,960 --> 02:55:55,359
supply to demand to supply to demand to

4487
02:55:55,359 --> 02:55:58,160
supply to demand to supply to demand

4488
02:55:58,160 --> 02:56:01,359
back and forth between this whole thing

4489
02:56:01,359 --> 02:56:02,960
just ricocheting through this whole

4490
02:56:02,960 --> 02:56:05,200
thing so this demand stays valid this

4491
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:07,200
supply stays valid and we just bounce

4492
02:56:07,200 --> 02:56:12,359
between it until it gives us a direction

4493
02:56:13,200 --> 02:56:14,960
and and this happens

4494
02:56:14,960 --> 02:56:18,240
quite a lot this happens often

4495
02:56:18,240 --> 02:56:20,479
so this is why i come on here to teach

4496
02:56:20,479 --> 02:56:21,680
this because

4497
02:56:21,680 --> 02:56:23,760
you guys are going to see this whether

4498
02:56:23,760 --> 02:56:25,920
you like it or not

4499
02:56:25,920 --> 02:56:26,800
now

4500
02:56:26,800 --> 02:56:28,720
you guys are going to go on the charts

4501
02:56:28,720 --> 02:56:29,840
and you guys are going to see this

4502
02:56:29,840 --> 02:56:32,640
happen over and over and over and over

4503
02:56:32,640 --> 02:56:34,240
and over and over and over and over and

4504
02:56:34,240 --> 02:56:37,840
over and over and i've never never again

4505
02:56:37,840 --> 02:56:40,399
to where you can't unsee it it's gonna

4506
02:56:40,399 --> 02:56:44,240
happen over and over again

4507
02:56:44,240 --> 02:56:46,080
you see how i said sometimes it can push

4508
02:56:46,080 --> 02:56:47,200
through

4509
02:56:47,200 --> 02:56:49,920
these imbalances

4510
02:56:49,920 --> 02:56:52,319
you can push through them

4511
02:56:52,319 --> 02:56:55,279
what do we have as as you know areas

4512
02:56:55,279 --> 02:56:57,120
above the imbalance where we could

4513
02:56:57,120 --> 02:56:59,840
potentially say it could tap

4514
02:56:59,840 --> 02:57:02,080
look at here

4515
02:57:02,080 --> 02:57:05,680
move this out so you could see

4516
02:57:05,920 --> 02:57:09,560
what did we just tap

4517
02:57:10,880 --> 02:57:13,520
whether we just tap that to cause this

4518
02:57:13,520 --> 02:57:16,319
this rejection

4519
02:57:16,479 --> 02:57:18,560
this supply yes

4520
02:57:18,560 --> 02:57:20,840
that's valid

4521
02:57:20,840 --> 02:57:22,479
if

4522
02:57:22,479 --> 02:57:26,160
if someone is thinking the supply

4523
02:57:28,640 --> 02:57:31,120
supply is valid

4524
02:57:31,120 --> 02:57:32,880
but

4525
02:57:32,880 --> 02:57:36,240
more accurately

4526
02:57:36,240 --> 02:57:39,120
we tapped the supply and we came in

4527
02:57:39,120 --> 02:57:41,040
we had about seven people draw down real

4528
02:57:41,040 --> 02:57:42,790
fast and then out of it

4529
02:57:42,790 --> 02:57:44,399
[Music]

4530
02:57:44,399 --> 02:57:47,359
you know we're here 15 pips

4531
02:57:47,359 --> 02:57:48,840
but forget

4532
02:57:48,840 --> 02:57:50,560
this

4533
02:57:50,560 --> 02:57:51,720
and look at

4534
02:57:51,720 --> 02:57:54,240
[Music]

4535
02:57:54,240 --> 02:57:59,120
this fractal sorry this fractal tab

4536
02:57:59,359 --> 02:58:00,560
look at this

4537
02:58:00,560 --> 02:58:03,200
we tap this fractal

4538
02:58:03,200 --> 02:58:05,359
and then went down

4539
02:58:05,359 --> 02:58:08,080
what did the fractal give us 21 pips and

4540
02:58:08,080 --> 02:58:09,439
counting

4541
02:58:09,439 --> 02:58:11,359
this could be going for the imbalance

4542
02:58:11,359 --> 02:58:15,479
that's in here i'm not too sure

4543
02:58:19,040 --> 02:58:20,800
or continue to push further into the

4544
02:58:20,800 --> 02:58:23,200
area as well

4545
02:58:23,200 --> 02:58:25,680
there is this

4546
02:58:25,680 --> 02:58:27,120
area here

4547
02:58:27,120 --> 02:58:29,600
but it's still overshadowed by this

4548
02:58:29,600 --> 02:58:31,600
whole area here but look look at this

4549
02:58:31,600 --> 02:58:33,279
look at this

4550
02:58:33,279 --> 02:58:35,920
look at what i'm saying and we're seeing

4551
02:58:35,920 --> 02:58:38,240
it happen live we're seeing this happen

4552
02:58:38,240 --> 02:58:39,920
live

4553
02:58:39,920 --> 02:58:42,880
supply demand supply demand supply

4554
02:58:42,880 --> 02:58:47,560
demand supply demand supply

4555
02:58:49,600 --> 02:58:54,120
you see the zones are still valid

4556
02:59:02,880 --> 02:59:05,279
man

4557
02:59:05,520 --> 02:59:08,479
i love charting guys i love it

4558
02:59:08,479 --> 02:59:11,520
i love charting

4559
02:59:12,640 --> 02:59:15,840
i love it because

4560
02:59:16,560 --> 02:59:17,439
it's

4561
02:59:17,439 --> 02:59:19,439
it's simple

4562
02:59:19,439 --> 02:59:22,080
it's predictable

4563
02:59:22,080 --> 02:59:25,040
and for me that's that's how i am i'm

4564
02:59:25,040 --> 02:59:29,279
very simple like very very simple

4565
02:59:29,279 --> 02:59:31,760
yeah like

4566
02:59:32,000 --> 02:59:35,120
it doesn't take a lot for me

4567
02:59:35,120 --> 02:59:36,720
and i've found a trading style that

4568
02:59:36,720 --> 02:59:40,160
suits my personality

4569
02:59:40,160 --> 02:59:42,000
there's this gut this other guy that

4570
02:59:42,000 --> 02:59:44,640
that trades on here um

4571
02:59:44,640 --> 02:59:46,319
i was gonna go get his video but let me

4572
02:59:46,319 --> 02:59:47,920
not

4573
02:59:47,920 --> 02:59:49,760
stop being problematic

4574
02:59:49,760 --> 02:59:51,600
um

4575
02:59:51,600 --> 02:59:56,000
he says that you should look at um

4576
02:59:56,000 --> 02:59:57,920
let me actually see if i could find it

4577
02:59:57,920 --> 03:00:00,240
um

4578
03:00:01,040 --> 03:00:03,600
what was it

4579
03:00:04,000 --> 03:00:07,279
ig market

4580
03:00:07,760 --> 03:00:10,920
is it

4581
03:00:11,840 --> 03:00:15,279
so he he goes here

4582
03:00:15,439 --> 03:00:17,680
and

4583
03:00:21,760 --> 03:00:25,840
i don't know where exactly

4584
03:00:26,319 --> 03:00:27,840
it is

4585
03:00:27,840 --> 03:00:30,160
um

4586
03:00:30,640 --> 03:00:33,040
it's like somewhere within one of these

4587
03:00:33,040 --> 03:00:35,520
things

4588
03:00:37,359 --> 03:00:39,359
he goes to this

4589
03:00:39,359 --> 03:00:41,600
uh

4590
03:00:42,800 --> 03:00:44,399
yeah i don't know where exactly it is

4591
03:00:44,399 --> 03:00:48,240
but he goes here and he goes to

4592
03:00:49,520 --> 03:00:51,279
here

4593
03:00:51,279 --> 03:00:53,840
um

4594
03:00:54,680 --> 03:00:58,960
msnbc what is it um

4595
03:00:59,359 --> 03:01:00,319
dao

4596
03:01:00,319 --> 03:01:03,960
so he goes here

4597
03:01:07,439 --> 03:01:10,080
just like this

4598
03:01:10,800 --> 03:01:13,439
and he goes

4599
03:01:15,279 --> 03:01:16,399
uh

4600
03:01:16,399 --> 03:01:18,479
pop-ups he goes just like this and he

4601
03:01:18,479 --> 03:01:20,479
goes look at the amount of them they're

4602
03:01:20,479 --> 03:01:22,960
red and they're blue

4603
03:01:22,960 --> 03:01:25,520
and i mean red and green

4604
03:01:25,520 --> 03:01:27,520
and it gives you an idea of what you

4605
03:01:27,520 --> 03:01:30,240
should be doing today

4606
03:01:30,240 --> 03:01:33,600
whether you should buy or sell

4607
03:01:33,680 --> 03:01:36,800
and he goes just like this

4608
03:01:38,399 --> 03:01:39,840
he he'll

4609
03:01:39,840 --> 03:01:43,200
click on like something like this

4610
03:01:43,200 --> 03:01:45,920
and he'll look at the whole number 29

4611
03:01:45,920 --> 03:01:49,520
000 and he'll go okay it's

4612
03:01:49,520 --> 03:01:51,439
it's plus

4613
03:01:51,439 --> 03:01:53,760
you know 5.48

4614
03:01:53,760 --> 03:01:55,439
so this is letting us know it's bullish

4615
03:01:55,439 --> 03:01:56,960
we should buy

4616
03:01:56,960 --> 03:01:59,680
he does that now this has dax on it this

4617
03:01:59,680 --> 03:02:02,080
is shanghai this has the japan exchange

4618
03:02:02,080 --> 03:02:03,359
this is

4619
03:02:03,359 --> 03:02:05,680
um hong kong

4620
03:02:05,680 --> 03:02:07,200
some of our exchanges the london

4621
03:02:07,200 --> 03:02:08,399
exchange

4622
03:02:08,399 --> 03:02:11,040
you know german it has all of that there

4623
03:02:11,040 --> 03:02:13,920
but this is useless

4624
03:02:13,920 --> 03:02:17,359
for us when it comes to charting

4625
03:02:17,359 --> 03:02:19,200
this is useless

4626
03:02:19,200 --> 03:02:21,600
because

4627
03:02:22,240 --> 03:02:24,720
when we had that

4628
03:02:24,720 --> 03:02:26,880
and the market opened initially that

4629
03:02:26,880 --> 03:02:29,200
would have been in the green

4630
03:02:29,200 --> 03:02:31,359
when the market had that push-up

4631
03:02:31,359 --> 03:02:32,800
and people would have saw that and

4632
03:02:32,800 --> 03:02:36,080
thought okay our biases to buy

4633
03:02:36,080 --> 03:02:39,359
and immediately after the market opened

4634
03:02:39,359 --> 03:02:40,479
up

4635
03:02:40,479 --> 03:02:43,840
not even half an hour later

4636
03:02:43,840 --> 03:02:46,399
sell-off

4637
03:02:46,960 --> 03:02:49,600
within less than an hour

4638
03:02:49,600 --> 03:02:53,120
and what are people going to say

4639
03:02:53,120 --> 03:02:55,520
with this

4640
03:02:55,920 --> 03:02:58,399
oh what happened you you said to look at

4641
03:02:58,399 --> 03:03:00,640
that and and look at this and then you

4642
03:03:00,640 --> 03:03:02,880
know what you'll be doing for the day

4643
03:03:02,880 --> 03:03:04,960
but

4644
03:03:04,960 --> 03:03:06,560
it failed

4645
03:03:06,560 --> 03:03:08,240
what's the explanation behind that do

4646
03:03:08,240 --> 03:03:11,279
you know i heard this guy tell

4647
03:03:11,279 --> 03:03:12,800
the person

4648
03:03:12,800 --> 03:03:15,120
that they were wrong

4649
03:03:15,120 --> 03:03:16,720
you were wrong you didn't follow my

4650
03:03:16,720 --> 03:03:18,960
system i told you when it hit this and

4651
03:03:18,960 --> 03:03:22,640
that and i told you when it does this

4652
03:03:22,640 --> 03:03:25,040
you gotta follow my system

4653
03:03:25,040 --> 03:03:26,560
that's that's what he literally said to

4654
03:03:26,560 --> 03:03:28,000
me

4655
03:03:28,000 --> 03:03:30,479
you follow my system

4656
03:03:30,479 --> 03:03:33,840
you didn't follow it correctly

4657
03:03:34,479 --> 03:03:36,880
what

4658
03:03:36,880 --> 03:03:38,800
first of all the system is flawed that

4659
03:03:38,800 --> 03:03:40,479
should have never been something that

4660
03:03:40,479 --> 03:03:42,319
anyone should should have been agreeing

4661
03:03:42,319 --> 03:03:45,359
to to follow

4662
03:03:45,680 --> 03:03:46,960
anyone

4663
03:03:46,960 --> 03:03:50,160
so now these two zones are invalidated

4664
03:03:50,160 --> 03:03:52,080
this one here

4665
03:03:52,080 --> 03:03:54,000
i mean maybe further into this could

4666
03:03:54,000 --> 03:03:56,319
still be validated like the middle area

4667
03:03:56,319 --> 03:03:58,640
of this let me just place this here just

4668
03:03:58,640 --> 03:04:00,399
in case it comes down

4669
03:04:00,399 --> 03:04:02,319
maybe that

4670
03:04:02,319 --> 03:04:04,720
could still be valid but

4671
03:04:04,720 --> 03:04:06,960
the touch of it is about imbalance as

4672
03:04:06,960 --> 03:04:08,640
well as this zone isn't valid because it

4673
03:04:08,640 --> 03:04:11,359
was traded through

4674
03:04:11,920 --> 03:04:13,920
and and what does that what does that do

4675
03:04:13,920 --> 03:04:16,319
for the

4676
03:04:16,319 --> 03:04:18,319
the um

4677
03:04:18,319 --> 03:04:20,960
head and shoulders pattern guy

4678
03:04:20,960 --> 03:04:24,240
with his stops 126 pips right behind the

4679
03:04:24,240 --> 03:04:25,439
shoulder

4680
03:04:25,439 --> 03:04:27,279
and he's targeting

4681
03:04:27,279 --> 03:04:30,800
these areas these zones down here

4682
03:04:30,800 --> 03:04:34,720
he's his stop is 126 pips his target is

4683
03:04:34,720 --> 03:04:37,720
92.

4684
03:04:38,160 --> 03:04:39,200
and then you

4685
03:04:39,200 --> 03:04:41,279
ring it over

4686
03:04:41,279 --> 03:04:43,279
and all they're seeing all they're

4687
03:04:43,279 --> 03:04:46,399
seeing around their entry is this

4688
03:04:46,399 --> 03:04:50,240
they get in oh we were in some profit

4689
03:04:50,240 --> 03:04:52,880
now we're in drawdown now in profit now

4690
03:04:52,880 --> 03:04:54,080
we're going to draw it out now we're in

4691
03:04:54,080 --> 03:04:56,080
profit now we enjoy that now we're

4692
03:04:56,080 --> 03:04:58,080
profit that we're enjoying that that

4693
03:04:58,080 --> 03:05:02,760
we're profit now we're out

4694
03:05:10,720 --> 03:05:11,840
so

4695
03:05:11,840 --> 03:05:13,920
this could have took the equal highs

4696
03:05:13,920 --> 03:05:16,399
that were created

4697
03:05:16,399 --> 03:05:18,479
tapped up into an area

4698
03:05:18,479 --> 03:05:21,439
and then come down and run the equilos

4699
03:05:21,439 --> 03:05:23,279
that it created also

4700
03:05:23,279 --> 03:05:27,439
but this is the creation of liquidity

4701
03:05:27,439 --> 03:05:30,800
this back and forth movement

4702
03:05:30,800 --> 03:05:33,120
between two zones

4703
03:05:33,120 --> 03:05:34,880
back and forth movement

4704
03:05:34,880 --> 03:05:37,359
between a higher time frame zone

4705
03:05:37,359 --> 03:05:40,880
and a one minute time frame zone

4706
03:05:41,520 --> 03:05:43,279
rips up

4707
03:05:43,279 --> 03:05:45,279
runs everybody's stops that are back

4708
03:05:45,279 --> 03:05:46,960
here

4709
03:05:46,960 --> 03:05:48,880
rips up

4710
03:05:48,880 --> 03:05:51,359
comes up maybe establishes equal highs

4711
03:05:51,359 --> 03:05:53,920
or runs it

4712
03:05:53,920 --> 03:05:56,240
and then sometimes has the propensity to

4713
03:05:56,240 --> 03:05:58,840
run it and then come down and run all of

4714
03:05:58,840 --> 03:06:01,600
this you got trend line liquidity here

4715
03:06:01,600 --> 03:06:05,120
you got equal lows here

4716
03:06:05,200 --> 03:06:07,439
and then we ran the equal lows here

4717
03:06:07,439 --> 03:06:09,920
along with the trend line liquidity here

4718
03:06:09,920 --> 03:06:12,720
we ran all of that going up to the very

4719
03:06:12,720 --> 03:06:14,560
t of it

4720
03:06:14,560 --> 03:06:16,000
and there's a possibility that we could

4721
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:18,240
still take this high

4722
03:06:18,240 --> 03:06:21,359
and just start to melt down

4723
03:06:21,359 --> 03:06:24,080
run these lows run these lows

4724
03:06:24,080 --> 03:06:26,640
back into the area that we may be

4725
03:06:26,640 --> 03:06:29,520
actually buying from

4726
03:06:29,520 --> 03:06:31,920
we tap into this area

4727
03:06:31,920 --> 03:06:34,560
and then to be continue

4728
03:06:34,560 --> 03:06:37,200
for sunday into monday

4729
03:06:37,200 --> 03:06:38,560
and that could be the trajectory of the

4730
03:06:38,560 --> 03:06:42,040
rest of the day

4731
03:06:42,560 --> 03:06:43,920
that could be what would happen for the

4732
03:06:43,920 --> 03:06:45,600
rest of the day so we just did the top

4733
03:06:45,600 --> 03:06:46,880
down right

4734
03:06:46,880 --> 03:06:49,520
and the top down we have mentioned

4735
03:06:49,520 --> 03:06:51,200
i believe we mentioned that this was an

4736
03:06:51,200 --> 03:06:53,600
area i don't want to lie about it

4737
03:06:53,600 --> 03:06:57,120
but i do remember that we mentioned that

4738
03:06:57,120 --> 03:06:58,640
they could potentially be looking to

4739
03:06:58,640 --> 03:07:01,840
take some of these highs

4740
03:07:02,560 --> 03:07:04,080
let me go back and check if this is the

4741
03:07:04,080 --> 03:07:06,479
area because i don't want to

4742
03:07:06,479 --> 03:07:08,720
say that i'm lying yes this was an area

4743
03:07:08,720 --> 03:07:10,399
i said if we came up

4744
03:07:10,399 --> 03:07:12,640
we could run this first

4745
03:07:12,640 --> 03:07:14,640
and after we run this we want to watch

4746
03:07:14,640 --> 03:07:17,760
and see what could potentially happen

4747
03:07:17,760 --> 03:07:19,680
because we could run this and have a

4748
03:07:19,680 --> 03:07:22,399
fall back down but we could also come to

4749
03:07:22,399 --> 03:07:23,520
this

4750
03:07:23,520 --> 03:07:25,120
here

4751
03:07:25,120 --> 03:07:27,600
this area as well

4752
03:07:27,600 --> 03:07:29,279
and if we run this high there could

4753
03:07:29,279 --> 03:07:31,680
potentially be a rejection here so these

4754
03:07:31,680 --> 03:07:34,080
are all targets but these are all areas

4755
03:07:34,080 --> 03:07:37,439
to pay attention to because when price

4756
03:07:37,439 --> 03:07:38,880
takes them

4757
03:07:38,880 --> 03:07:40,240
when it

4758
03:07:40,240 --> 03:07:42,240
cuts above that area

4759
03:07:42,240 --> 03:07:43,120
then

4760
03:07:43,120 --> 03:07:45,760
there's a possibility that

4761
03:07:45,760 --> 03:07:47,120
it

4762
03:07:47,120 --> 03:07:49,520
falls

4763
03:07:49,680 --> 03:07:51,600
activating the buy stop cell stops in

4764
03:07:51,600 --> 03:07:53,680
those areas

4765
03:07:53,680 --> 03:07:56,160
so this is why when i do the top down i

4766
03:07:56,160 --> 03:07:58,319
tell people like hey pay attention to

4767
03:07:58,319 --> 03:08:00,560
this stuff like

4768
03:08:00,560 --> 03:08:04,319
this stuff is is is wild it's like the

4769
03:08:04,319 --> 03:08:06,800
way that it actually happens there's

4770
03:08:06,800 --> 03:08:09,120
nothing else that should ever be taught

4771
03:08:09,120 --> 03:08:12,240
in finance other than this

4772
03:08:12,240 --> 03:08:13,840
in terms of trading

4773
03:08:13,840 --> 03:08:16,000
there's nothing else that should be

4774
03:08:16,000 --> 03:08:18,240
taught

4775
03:08:18,240 --> 03:08:20,640
other than this

4776
03:08:20,640 --> 03:08:22,319
so let me remove this so nobody's

4777
03:08:22,319 --> 03:08:23,920
mistaken by it

4778
03:08:23,920 --> 03:08:25,439
um

4779
03:08:25,439 --> 03:08:28,560
this would have been a loss for

4780
03:08:28,560 --> 03:08:30,319
the head and shoulders pattern guy

4781
03:08:30,319 --> 03:08:32,160
whether he put his stop-loss here or

4782
03:08:32,160 --> 03:08:34,560
whether you put his loss behind here

4783
03:08:34,560 --> 03:08:36,399
that would have been a major loss for

4784
03:08:36,399 --> 03:08:38,800
that guy

4785
03:08:39,200 --> 03:08:41,279
but we get into optimal areas what's

4786
03:08:41,279 --> 03:08:45,279
this area imbalance from the left side

4787
03:08:45,279 --> 03:08:46,880
you guys want to learn about zones and

4788
03:08:46,880 --> 03:08:48,800
all that other stuff take them they're

4789
03:08:48,800 --> 03:08:50,880
here take them baby

4790
03:08:50,880 --> 03:08:52,240
i'll see you when it gets there and i

4791
03:08:52,240 --> 03:08:55,359
hope you're faster than me

4792
03:08:56,720 --> 03:08:58,160
just like that

4793
03:08:58,160 --> 03:09:00,000
craig what's up how's everything man

4794
03:09:00,000 --> 03:09:01,520
good seeing you

4795
03:09:01,520 --> 03:09:03,600
craig he he's

4796
03:09:03,600 --> 03:09:06,160
this guy is his bull running through

4797
03:09:06,160 --> 03:09:08,319
through the charts like

4798
03:09:08,319 --> 03:09:11,200
like he's he's learning it at just

4799
03:09:11,200 --> 03:09:13,760
a different rate than than most people

4800
03:09:13,760 --> 03:09:14,560
that

4801
03:09:14,560 --> 03:09:16,640
that i've seen and taught

4802
03:09:16,640 --> 03:09:19,200
like let me let me show you guys this

4803
03:09:19,200 --> 03:09:20,399
um

4804
03:09:20,399 --> 03:09:21,920
i told him i was gonna mention it on

4805
03:09:21,920 --> 03:09:22,880
stream

4806
03:09:22,880 --> 03:09:24,399
um

4807
03:09:24,399 --> 03:09:27,439
but let me show you guys

4808
03:09:28,560 --> 03:09:31,840
he's he's been doing pretty good

4809
03:09:31,840 --> 03:09:34,560
and and this is coming from like no

4810
03:09:34,560 --> 03:09:37,760
knowledge of forex at all like

4811
03:09:37,760 --> 03:09:38,560
none

4812
03:09:38,560 --> 03:09:39,439
to

4813
03:09:39,439 --> 03:09:42,239
starting to learn and try to utilize my

4814
03:09:42,239 --> 03:09:44,960
techniques that i'm i'm teaching him

4815
03:09:44,960 --> 03:09:48,080
you know this is this is um a

4816
03:09:48,080 --> 03:09:49,840
demo by the way i know some of y'all be

4817
03:09:49,840 --> 03:09:51,439
hating on demo but that's where you

4818
03:09:51,439 --> 03:09:53,520
learn that's where i started learning

4819
03:09:53,520 --> 03:09:55,279
from demo and then i was able to but

4820
03:09:55,279 --> 03:09:57,680
look at this

4821
03:09:57,680 --> 03:09:59,200
you see this

4822
03:09:59,200 --> 03:10:02,560
this us dollar is that that

4823
03:10:03,040 --> 03:10:06,000
so if he had 500 in his account

4824
03:10:06,000 --> 03:10:07,840
just learning and yeah some people might

4825
03:10:07,840 --> 03:10:09,600
look at this and be like oh it's over

4826
03:10:09,600 --> 03:10:11,600
leveraging lot size too high blah blah

4827
03:10:11,600 --> 03:10:12,720
blah

4828
03:10:12,720 --> 03:10:15,760
sometimes accurate techniques do not

4829
03:10:15,760 --> 03:10:17,920
use the same rules for

4830
03:10:17,920 --> 03:10:19,439
for um

4831
03:10:19,439 --> 03:10:21,600
you know just lot size and things like

4832
03:10:21,600 --> 03:10:23,439
that if you can get the perfect touch of

4833
03:10:23,439 --> 03:10:25,120
certain areas and you're just scalping

4834
03:10:25,120 --> 03:10:28,000
on those areas or scalps turn into long

4835
03:10:28,000 --> 03:10:31,359
longer moves you know like look at this

4836
03:10:31,359 --> 03:10:33,920
this is this is remarkable like somebody

4837
03:10:33,920 --> 03:10:35,520
taking the basic stuff of what i'm

4838
03:10:35,520 --> 03:10:36,960
telling them

4839
03:10:36,960 --> 03:10:39,359
with no knowledge of charting no

4840
03:10:39,359 --> 03:10:42,640
knowledge of none of that

4841
03:10:42,640 --> 03:10:44,960
to basic

4842
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:47,040
things that i'm teaching them

4843
03:10:47,040 --> 03:10:49,040
i give people a beginner track to go

4844
03:10:49,040 --> 03:10:50,080
through

4845
03:10:50,080 --> 03:10:52,000
i tell them to

4846
03:10:52,000 --> 03:10:54,960
you know learn um the one hour video

4847
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:57,040
with adam kuh it's a good explanation

4848
03:10:57,040 --> 03:10:58,800
for the basics or the foundation of

4849
03:10:58,800 --> 03:10:59,840
forex

4850
03:10:59,840 --> 03:11:01,680
and then i bring them into beginner

4851
03:11:01,680 --> 03:11:03,200
charting videos

4852
03:11:03,200 --> 03:11:05,439
that smart money source has a playlist

4853
03:11:05,439 --> 03:11:08,399
for those beginner videos

4854
03:11:08,399 --> 03:11:10,160
and then after that

4855
03:11:10,160 --> 03:11:11,920
try to get them into understanding

4856
03:11:11,920 --> 03:11:13,760
supply and demand

4857
03:11:13,760 --> 03:11:16,479
then get them to understand and wipe off

4858
03:11:16,479 --> 03:11:17,840
and then

4859
03:11:17,840 --> 03:11:20,160
get them to understand my zones

4860
03:11:20,160 --> 03:11:22,479
and

4861
03:11:22,479 --> 03:11:24,319
then the the more you're hungry for it

4862
03:11:24,319 --> 03:11:26,560
the more you want to learn the faster

4863
03:11:26,560 --> 03:11:29,120
you accelerate in learning and look look

4864
03:11:29,120 --> 03:11:30,720
at this

4865
03:11:30,720 --> 03:11:33,920
this is 500 and he almost 100 his

4866
03:11:33,920 --> 03:11:36,000
account

4867
03:11:36,000 --> 03:11:37,840
just utilizing what i'm teaching

4868
03:11:37,840 --> 03:11:39,680
entirely different from what people

4869
03:11:39,680 --> 03:11:42,560
teach you but entirely doable

4870
03:11:42,560 --> 03:11:44,880
that's why i said i could take 600 to 20

4871
03:11:44,880 --> 03:11:47,279
000 in one week if i wanted to

4872
03:11:47,279 --> 03:11:48,840
entirely

4873
03:11:48,840 --> 03:11:50,800
doable

4874
03:11:50,800 --> 03:11:53,120
entirely doable

4875
03:11:53,120 --> 03:11:55,279
this is somebody just just trading just

4876
03:11:55,279 --> 03:11:56,399
learning

4877
03:11:56,399 --> 03:11:58,479
they continue to apply these same

4878
03:11:58,479 --> 03:12:00,560
principles and techniques

4879
03:12:00,560 --> 03:12:01,520
and

4880
03:12:01,520 --> 03:12:04,160
it will take their trading

4881
03:12:04,160 --> 03:12:07,600
to to a different direction

4882
03:12:07,600 --> 03:12:08,880
take the trade to a whole different

4883
03:12:08,880 --> 03:12:10,640
level

4884
03:12:10,640 --> 03:12:14,560
so look you get the rejection from here

4885
03:12:15,200 --> 03:12:17,200
you get the rejection at this line

4886
03:12:17,200 --> 03:12:19,840
here

4887
03:12:20,239 --> 03:12:22,160
we get rejected we come down look at

4888
03:12:22,160 --> 03:12:23,520
that

4889
03:12:23,520 --> 03:12:26,160
30 pips down off of just

4890
03:12:26,160 --> 03:12:29,200
a little tap in a rejection

4891
03:12:29,200 --> 03:12:30,399
but we would have got out a little

4892
03:12:30,399 --> 03:12:32,080
earlier because what we would have got

4893
03:12:32,080 --> 03:12:34,720
out the fractal

4894
03:12:34,720 --> 03:12:36,399
yeah there was a fractal directly above

4895
03:12:36,399 --> 03:12:39,840
it but it just made that fractal

4896
03:12:40,080 --> 03:12:42,560
well look

4897
03:12:44,160 --> 03:12:48,160
27 pips one minute

4898
03:12:48,160 --> 03:12:51,200
tap into a fractal then you know the tap

4899
03:12:51,200 --> 03:12:52,880
into the fractal can also be the

4900
03:12:52,880 --> 03:12:57,439
rejection to take you up past the high

4901
03:12:57,439 --> 03:12:58,960
where do we go to the next line that we

4902
03:12:58,960 --> 03:13:00,720
have established 71 pips from the

4903
03:13:00,720 --> 03:13:03,520
fractal to the next line

4904
03:13:03,520 --> 03:13:05,279
where do we tap

4905
03:13:05,279 --> 03:13:08,960
from the next line here

4906
03:13:09,600 --> 03:13:11,520
back into this area

4907
03:13:11,520 --> 03:13:13,920
maybe on the fractal maybe possibly

4908
03:13:13,920 --> 03:13:17,359
within the imbalance that's here

4909
03:13:17,359 --> 03:13:19,600
yeah i think this is imbalance

4910
03:13:19,600 --> 03:13:21,760
but usually this little short movement

4911
03:13:21,760 --> 03:13:24,239
like up here and then it stops here and

4912
03:13:24,239 --> 03:13:26,239
pushes down usually gives me a short

4913
03:13:26,239 --> 03:13:27,600
from there

4914
03:13:27,600 --> 03:13:30,640
but look at this

4915
03:13:33,840 --> 03:13:37,359
i know sorry i was doing the imbalance

4916
03:13:40,399 --> 03:13:43,399
here

4917
03:13:45,680 --> 03:13:46,880
and here

4918
03:13:46,880 --> 03:13:50,960
look at that tapped into the imbalance

4919
03:13:53,040 --> 03:13:55,359
tapped into the imbalance pushed you up

4920
03:13:55,359 --> 03:13:57,840
to here 28 pips

4921
03:13:57,840 --> 03:14:01,120
what did i say about this movement up

4922
03:14:01,120 --> 03:14:03,040
and then back down

4923
03:14:03,040 --> 03:14:05,040
i said that for some reason

4924
03:14:05,040 --> 03:14:07,120
whenever price retraces back up to this

4925
03:14:07,120 --> 03:14:08,960
area it rejects out of it whether it's

4926
03:14:08,960 --> 03:14:10,880
the top side or the bottom side and a

4927
03:14:10,880 --> 03:14:13,520
lot of it has to do with

4928
03:14:13,520 --> 03:14:14,720
um

4929
03:14:14,720 --> 03:14:16,880
you know like big like he mentioned it

4930
03:14:16,880 --> 03:14:17,920
could be

4931
03:14:17,920 --> 03:14:20,720
an order block within here ict order

4932
03:14:20,720 --> 03:14:23,520
block within here

4933
03:14:23,520 --> 03:14:25,279
you know and if there's an ict autoblock

4934
03:14:25,279 --> 03:14:27,120
width in here that could be responsible

4935
03:14:27,120 --> 03:14:29,200
for this rejection but that's on a lower

4936
03:14:29,200 --> 03:14:30,479
time frame

4937
03:14:30,479 --> 03:14:32,160
that's not even on this time frame

4938
03:14:32,160 --> 03:14:34,479
that's on a lower time frame

4939
03:14:34,479 --> 03:14:37,279
but according to candlestick structure

4940
03:14:37,279 --> 03:14:39,520
this also makes it

4941
03:14:39,520 --> 03:14:41,439
you know possible as well

4942
03:14:41,439 --> 03:14:42,560
to be

4943
03:14:42,560 --> 03:14:44,080
a rejection because look we get this

4944
03:14:44,080 --> 03:14:46,399
high we take this low then we trade back

4945
03:14:46,399 --> 03:14:48,160
above this high

4946
03:14:48,160 --> 03:14:50,560
and then we run the low so after we run

4947
03:14:50,560 --> 03:14:52,239
the low what are we looking for a

4948
03:14:52,239 --> 03:14:54,560
retracement within this area and then a

4949
03:14:54,560 --> 03:14:57,040
short from it to the next area

4950
03:14:57,040 --> 03:14:58,560
and where's where's the next area that

4951
03:14:58,560 --> 03:15:00,720
we're shorting to the s d that's down

4952
03:15:00,720 --> 03:15:01,430
here

4953
03:15:01,430 --> 03:15:03,760
[Music]

4954
03:15:03,760 --> 03:15:05,600
and i get this is this is you know

4955
03:15:05,600 --> 03:15:07,279
probably coming in fast and coming in

4956
03:15:07,279 --> 03:15:10,239
hot for you guys you know who who may be

4957
03:15:10,239 --> 03:15:13,279
new or who may not really understand

4958
03:15:13,279 --> 03:15:16,239
all of the different concepts together

4959
03:15:16,239 --> 03:15:19,359
that i'm teaching in one i i get that it

4960
03:15:19,359 --> 03:15:22,479
it could be difficult but you guys are

4961
03:15:22,479 --> 03:15:24,560
literally watching me show you price

4962
03:15:24,560 --> 03:15:26,800
movement and why everything is happening

4963
03:15:26,800 --> 03:15:28,560
the way it's happening

4964
03:15:28,560 --> 03:15:30,960
there's a reason for everything the

4965
03:15:30,960 --> 03:15:33,279
reason for everywhere that price start

4966
03:15:33,279 --> 03:15:36,319
stops on the chart there's a reason for

4967
03:15:36,319 --> 03:15:37,760
all of it

4968
03:15:37,760 --> 03:15:39,520
everywhere

4969
03:15:39,520 --> 03:15:41,439
there's a reason for it

4970
03:15:41,439 --> 03:15:42,319
so

4971
03:15:42,319 --> 03:15:43,920
i continue to try and teach you guys

4972
03:15:43,920 --> 03:15:45,680
this and help you guys understand this

4973
03:15:45,680 --> 03:15:47,600
because

4974
03:15:47,600 --> 03:15:48,960
this is

4975
03:15:48,960 --> 03:15:50,560
the only

4976
03:15:50,560 --> 03:15:53,680
way to trade the only way

4977
03:15:53,680 --> 03:15:55,840
to trade once you start trading this way

4978
03:15:55,840 --> 03:15:58,319
you will never go back to whatever way

4979
03:15:58,319 --> 03:16:00,640
you were trading before

4980
03:16:00,640 --> 03:16:03,200
once you learn this there's there's like

4981
03:16:03,200 --> 03:16:06,000
there's no going back

4982
03:16:06,000 --> 03:16:08,000
because all of this looks like lines but

4983
03:16:08,000 --> 03:16:09,200
all of them

4984
03:16:09,200 --> 03:16:11,120
exactly had a touch and gave you

4985
03:16:11,120 --> 03:16:12,800
something

4986
03:16:12,800 --> 03:16:15,040
all of them gave a reason for why it was

4987
03:16:15,040 --> 03:16:17,920
tapping there why it was rejecting there

4988
03:16:17,920 --> 03:16:19,840
all of it

4989
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:22,560
it all like just worked out that way it

4990
03:16:22,560 --> 03:16:24,640
told that story to you

4991
03:16:24,640 --> 03:16:25,760
you know so

4992
03:16:25,760 --> 03:16:26,960
um

4993
03:16:26,960 --> 03:16:30,000
i definitely want you guys to

4994
03:16:30,000 --> 03:16:32,640
to really like learn this

4995
03:16:32,640 --> 03:16:35,200
and really take this in

4996
03:16:35,200 --> 03:16:37,439
because it's it is a lot of teaching it

4997
03:16:37,439 --> 03:16:38,319
is like

4998
03:16:38,319 --> 03:16:40,640
our videos three hour videos this is

4999
03:16:40,640 --> 03:16:42,960
three hours now you know i'm thankful

5000
03:16:42,960 --> 03:16:45,120
for whoever sat through and listened to

5001
03:16:45,120 --> 03:16:46,560
what i had to say but this is three

5002
03:16:46,560 --> 03:16:47,680
hours

5003
03:16:47,680 --> 03:16:49,840
i don't take this lightly

5004
03:16:49,840 --> 03:16:52,000
you know like i do this as long as i do

5005
03:16:52,000 --> 03:16:53,520
it because

5006
03:16:53,520 --> 03:16:56,560
i know how much it's badly needed within

5007
03:16:56,560 --> 03:16:58,479
this industry

5008
03:16:58,479 --> 03:16:59,520
and

5009
03:16:59,520 --> 03:17:02,160
you know just

5010
03:17:02,560 --> 03:17:04,960
what good is it if i enjoy myself in in

5011
03:17:04,960 --> 03:17:05,950
greece

5012
03:17:05,950 --> 03:17:07,520
[Music]

5013
03:17:07,520 --> 03:17:08,319
and

5014
03:17:08,319 --> 03:17:10,800
people don't even have peace

5015
03:17:10,800 --> 03:17:12,479
i'm not a rapper though you know but

5016
03:17:12,479 --> 03:17:15,279
what good is it you know

5017
03:17:15,279 --> 03:17:17,120
like look we just placed this line here

5018
03:17:17,120 --> 03:17:20,080
we just placed this line here

5019
03:17:20,080 --> 03:17:22,479
just placed it

5020
03:17:22,479 --> 03:17:24,560
and we're already down

5021
03:17:24,560 --> 03:17:28,239
29 pips almost 30 pips

5022
03:17:28,239 --> 03:17:30,640
after just the top of that line we like

5023
03:17:30,640 --> 03:17:32,479
to see this little candlestick structure

5024
03:17:32,479 --> 03:17:34,720
that we talk about with

5025
03:17:34,720 --> 03:17:36,080
the um

5026
03:17:36,080 --> 03:17:37,760
the wick trades above

5027
03:17:37,760 --> 03:17:39,520
that and then comes back into the body

5028
03:17:39,520 --> 03:17:41,840
of it we love to see that because that

5029
03:17:41,840 --> 03:17:43,520
gives us an indication that we're in a

5030
03:17:43,520 --> 03:17:45,520
right trade

5031
03:17:45,520 --> 03:17:47,439
even if even if it's for a scalp this

5032
03:17:47,439 --> 03:17:50,080
can continue to push up and go

5033
03:17:50,080 --> 03:17:51,760
but even if this is for a scalp let me

5034
03:17:51,760 --> 03:17:53,840
see where can this go if it does come up

5035
03:17:53,840 --> 03:17:55,520
above

5036
03:17:55,520 --> 03:17:56,960
it already hit yeah it already came

5037
03:17:56,960 --> 03:17:59,840
there if it does come above already tap

5038
03:17:59,840 --> 03:18:02,080
i went below tapped right into this area

5039
03:18:02,080 --> 03:18:05,600
and then yeah so

5040
03:18:06,080 --> 03:18:09,080

i use a 10 lot size this is a 100 lot on

5076
03:19:23,439 --> 03:19:26,000
my broker that 45 pips would have been 4

03:19:26,000 --> 03:19:27,520
500.

these simple things

5104
03:20:36,479 --> 03:20:38,399
you see i'm not clicking on into all

5105
03:20:38,399 --> 03:20:40,479
these different pages and saying oh you

5106
03:20:40,479 --> 03:20:41,760
gotta look at this and then we get the

5107
03:20:41,760 --> 03:20:43,120
fundamentals from here and then we take

5108
03:20:43,120 --> 03:20:44,800
the numbers from there and then then if

5109
03:20:44,800 --> 03:20:46,399
we pass this resort oh there's some

5110
03:20:46,399 --> 03:20:48,640
strong resistance here this like people

5111
03:20:48,640 --> 03:20:50,800
get all animated to make it seem like

5112
03:20:50,800 --> 03:20:51,600
they know what they're talking about

5113
03:20:51,600 --> 03:20:52,399
they don't know what the hell are they

5114
03:20:52,399 --> 03:20:53,760
talking about

5115
03:20:53,760 --> 03:20:54,720
at all

5116
03:20:54,720 --> 03:20:56,880
they don't i've seen it

5117
03:20:56,880 --> 03:20:59,200
at all they don't know about it yeah i'm

5118
03:20:59,200 --> 03:21:01,040
telling you the way we think it got to

5119
03:21:01,040 --> 03:21:02,399
be

5120
03:21:02,399 --> 03:21:05,200
it got to be familiar bro i got it

5121
03:21:05,200 --> 03:21:06,720
but look i said

5122
03:21:06,720 --> 03:21:09,600
you know potentially equal highs on a on

5123
03:21:09,600 --> 03:21:12,399
a higher time frame

5124
03:21:12,399 --> 03:21:16,399
so if we didn't get the rejection here

5125
03:21:16,479 --> 03:21:18,880
that brought us down here 80 pips

5126
03:21:18,880 --> 03:21:20,399
then we had the opportunity to get the

5127
03:21:20,399 --> 03:21:22,000
rejection here

5128
03:21:22,000 --> 03:21:23,680
because we saw that one of our lows were

5129
03:21:23,680 --> 03:21:26,479
ran according to candlestick structure

5130
03:21:26,479 --> 03:21:28,800
and then price traded back up into here

5131
03:21:28,800 --> 03:21:31,680
and then took us down here

5132
03:21:31,680 --> 03:21:34,880
72 pips let's say we didn't get that we

5133
03:21:34,880 --> 03:21:37,439
talked about tapping here

5134
03:21:37,439 --> 03:21:39,760
we get down into here

5135
03:21:39,760 --> 03:21:41,439
60 pips

5136
03:21:41,439 --> 03:21:42,399
cool

5137
03:21:42,399 --> 03:21:44,479
why are we stopping there

5138
03:21:44,479 --> 03:21:47,600
why are we considering that as a tp

5139
03:21:47,600 --> 03:21:49,760
ah you guessed it right you guessed it

5140
03:21:49,760 --> 03:21:51,439
right

5141
03:21:51,439 --> 03:21:52,640
um

5142
03:21:52,640 --> 03:21:55,279
yeah you guessed it right

5143
03:21:55,279 --> 03:21:57,200
um

5144
03:21:57,200 --> 03:22:00,239
come on look at this imbalance

5145
03:22:00,239 --> 03:22:03,239
imbalance

5146
03:22:04,239 --> 03:22:08,080
like this is yo this is sauce

5147
03:22:08,080 --> 03:22:10,880
to create a new generation of advanced

5148
03:22:10,880 --> 03:22:13,279
traders

5149
03:22:13,279 --> 03:22:16,000
to be able to shift and change this

5150
03:22:16,000 --> 03:22:17,439
industry give

5151
03:22:17,439 --> 03:22:20,880
quality back to this industry

5152
03:22:20,880 --> 03:22:23,520
so you get a tap down there

5153
03:22:23,520 --> 03:22:25,600
then you got to tap from here

5154
03:22:25,600 --> 03:22:28,640
to possibly head back up

5155
03:22:28,640 --> 03:22:30,960
where into somebody's smds maybe that

5156
03:22:30,960 --> 03:22:33,120
they still have no mitigation and maybe

5157
03:22:33,120 --> 03:22:34,800
this one here

5158
03:22:34,800 --> 03:22:38,080
i don't know maybe this one i don't know

5159
03:22:38,080 --> 03:22:40,000
but i gave you your start

5160
03:22:40,000 --> 03:22:42,239
here

5161
03:22:42,960 --> 03:22:44,239
and that's why we don't have take

5162
03:22:44,239 --> 03:22:46,319
profits really we just look at what

5163
03:22:46,319 --> 03:22:48,160
price does in certain areas if you want

5164
03:22:48,160 --> 03:22:49,840
to use these zones just take profits

5165
03:22:49,840 --> 03:22:51,200
cool

5166
03:22:51,200 --> 03:22:53,520
you know you can

5167
03:22:53,520 --> 03:22:56,000
but we also know that that

5168
03:22:56,000 --> 03:22:58,080
we use these as

5169
03:22:58,080 --> 03:22:59,920
zones to trade from we use these as

5170
03:22:59,920 --> 03:23:02,160
entries we use these as targets we use

5171
03:23:02,160 --> 03:23:04,399
these as you know possible reversal

5172
03:23:04,399 --> 03:23:07,840
points not just imbalances smds too we

5173
03:23:07,840 --> 03:23:09,359
talk about the different smds the

5174
03:23:09,359 --> 03:23:12,479
candles the one with the wicks the

5175
03:23:12,479 --> 03:23:14,960
you know the fractals s and d's too all

5176
03:23:14,960 --> 03:23:17,040
of that all of that is here i'm giving

5177

5193
03:23:54,880 --> 03:23:57,840
to garner an audience or garner like or

5194
03:23:57,840 --> 03:24:00,319
foster a group of just like people who

5195
03:24:00,319 --> 03:24:03,680
love quality and people who enjoy that

5196
03:24:03,680 --> 03:24:04,880
nobody's going to come in here and

5197
03:24:04,880 --> 03:24:07,120
really get oh what you taught it caused

5198
03:24:07,120 --> 03:24:09,279
me to lose because okay if you lost then

5199
03:24:09,279 --> 03:24:10,800
you can still make it back still

5200
03:24:10,800 --> 03:24:12,800
opportunity to make it back

5201
03:24:12,800 --> 03:24:15,680
if you lost then

5202
03:24:15,760 --> 03:24:18,160
you know but i i know that this is is

5203
03:24:18,160 --> 03:24:20,880
such quality such quality in terms of

5204
03:24:20,880 --> 03:24:23,359
learning look at this imbalance tapped

5205
03:24:23,359 --> 03:24:26,800
up 50 pips up just off of the imbalance

5206
03:24:26,800 --> 03:24:29,520
where did we tap the middle of the s d

5207
03:24:29,520 --> 03:24:32,000
that i said was here we came back down

5208
03:24:32,000 --> 03:24:35,200
again come on

5209
03:24:36,000 --> 03:24:38,640
crazy

5210
03:24:38,640 --> 03:24:41,680
information these last two days

5211
03:24:41,680 --> 03:24:43,600
that i've taught i went over three hours

5212
03:24:43,600 --> 03:24:45,920
these last two days thursdays and

5213
03:24:45,920 --> 03:24:48,560
fridays are always the best

5214
03:24:48,560 --> 03:24:50,640
day in the market for me

5215
03:24:50,640 --> 03:24:52,800
people talk about oh friday's no volume

5216
03:24:52,800 --> 03:24:54,479
get out of here with that yeah there's

5217
03:24:54,479 --> 03:24:56,960
no volume but price still is going to do

5218
03:24:56,960 --> 03:24:58,000
what it does

5219
03:24:58,000 --> 03:25:00,160
so look watch you may have a rejection

5220
03:25:00,160 --> 03:25:02,800
from this area here um

5221
03:25:02,800 --> 03:25:03,920
could be a

5222
03:25:03,920 --> 03:25:06,239
sizable rejection maybe not not too sure

5223
03:25:06,239 --> 03:25:07,680
you know like

5224
03:25:07,680 --> 03:25:09,439
this is a possibility

5225
03:25:09,439 --> 03:25:10,560
um

5226
03:25:10,560 --> 03:25:13,439
because this actually was the s d that

5227
03:25:13,439 --> 03:25:15,520
shifted price above this but then we

5228
03:25:15,520 --> 03:25:18,399
also have this area still here

5229
03:25:18,399 --> 03:25:21,040
so with this area still being here this

5230
03:25:21,040 --> 03:25:23,279
is the most recent high remember what i

5231
03:25:23,279 --> 03:25:26,000
said to you guys i said between the last

5232
03:25:26,000 --> 03:25:27,680
low and high

5233
03:25:27,680 --> 03:25:29,920
price can do whatever it wants in

5234
03:25:29,920 --> 03:25:31,760
between these areas

5235
03:25:31,760 --> 03:25:32,479
so

5236
03:25:32,479 --> 03:25:34,800
this is the major structural high and

5237
03:25:34,800 --> 03:25:36,720
low but you got to know how to trade

5238
03:25:36,720 --> 03:25:38,319
intermediary structure you got to know

5239
03:25:38,319 --> 03:25:40,319
how to trade minor structure

5240
03:25:40,319 --> 03:25:42,319
you know and those things

5241
03:25:42,319 --> 03:25:44,239
help you with look at this candlestick

5242
03:25:44,239 --> 03:25:45,840
pattern i told you about

5243
03:25:45,840 --> 03:25:48,479
sauce man so even if this comes back and

5244
03:25:48,479 --> 03:25:51,520
goes down sauce

5245
03:25:51,520 --> 03:25:55,359
sauce this is that jerk sauce come on

5246
03:25:55,359 --> 03:25:58,000
the jerk sauce

5247
03:25:58,000 --> 03:25:59,040
mmm

5248
03:25:59,040 --> 03:26:01,680
sauce

5249
03:26:01,760 --> 03:26:03,600
yeah traveling that would be dope meet

5250
03:26:03,600 --> 03:26:05,920
up with dave the ea teacher

5251
03:26:05,920 --> 03:26:09,040
yeah gems exactly all of it

5252
03:26:09,040 --> 03:26:13,040
i'm showing it all in real time

5253
03:26:13,040 --> 03:26:15,439
because i want people to learn that way

5254
03:26:15,439 --> 03:26:17,439
all in real time i'm showing this to

5255
03:26:17,439 --> 03:26:19,120
people

5256
03:26:19,120 --> 03:26:20,800
because i know that there's a bunch of

5257
03:26:20,800 --> 03:26:23,120
garbage information out there and i want

5258
03:26:23,120 --> 03:26:26,319
you guys to understand the right way

5259
03:26:26,319 --> 03:26:28,800
so this is taken somebody asked me how

5260
03:26:28,800 --> 03:26:32,000
does the retail trader win

5261
03:26:32,000 --> 03:26:34,720
and i saw on jon stewart he actually has

5262
03:26:34,720 --> 03:26:37,040
a set a segment called the problem and

5263
03:26:37,040 --> 03:26:39,439
he talks about the finance industry and

5264
03:26:39,439 --> 03:26:41,680
how rigged and corrupt it is and he asks

5265
03:26:41,680 --> 03:26:44,319
how can retail traders win

5266
03:26:44,319 --> 03:26:45,680
the truth is

5267
03:26:45,680 --> 03:26:47,359
retail traders can win if they study

5268
03:26:47,359 --> 03:26:49,279
technical analysis that's it that's the

5269
03:26:49,279 --> 03:26:50,880
only thing i have to offer

5270
03:26:50,880 --> 03:26:52,880
maybe maybe money you know like if they

5271
03:26:52,880 --> 03:26:54,720
had access to more capital the way some

5272
03:26:54,720 --> 03:26:56,080
of these places do

5273
03:26:56,080 --> 03:26:57,600
but

5274
03:26:57,600 --> 03:26:59,520
technical analysis maybe

5275
03:26:59,520 --> 03:27:02,000
that's how retail traders can win

5276
03:27:02,000 --> 03:27:04,080
period there's no

5277
03:27:04,080 --> 03:27:07,600
other way for retail traders to win than

5278
03:27:07,600 --> 03:27:09,600
with technical analysis

5279
03:27:09,600 --> 03:27:12,080
no i do not believe in any other way

5280
03:27:12,080 --> 03:27:14,399
the guys in gamestop amc great work that

5281
03:27:14,399 --> 03:27:16,080
they did exposed in the industry but

5282
03:27:16,080 --> 03:27:19,040
that was a losing battle

5283
03:27:19,040 --> 03:27:21,040
that was a a

5284
03:27:21,040 --> 03:27:21,840
a

5285
03:27:21,840 --> 03:27:24,239
you know pump in the market to stick it

5286
03:27:24,239 --> 03:27:25,760
to the big guys but it was still a

5287
03:27:25,760 --> 03:27:27,279
losing battle they went in knowing they

5288
03:27:27,279 --> 03:27:29,840
were going to lose

5289
03:27:29,920 --> 03:27:31,840
so yeah they shifted the system did what

5290
03:27:31,840 --> 03:27:34,080
the system did to us but there are ways

5291
03:27:34,080 --> 03:27:36,479
to read and look at the footprints

5292
03:27:36,479 --> 03:27:38,960
that's within that

5293
03:27:38,960 --> 03:27:41,200
so i you know with me i teach these

5294
03:27:41,200 --> 03:27:43,279
things like these are my last

5295
03:27:43,279 --> 03:27:45,680

to me and i say that all the time not

5299
03:27:50,399 --> 03:27:52,239
not feeling like oh you know something

5300
03:27:52,239 --> 03:27:54,319
happened to me i'm losing my mind i'm

5301
03:27:54,319 --> 03:27:56,640
gonna get the last secrets out you guys

5302
03:27:56,640 --> 03:27:59,279
must notice if i died

5303
03:27:59,279 --> 03:28:00,720
the federal government killed me you

5304
03:28:00,720 --> 03:28:03,680

5305
03:28:03,680 --> 03:28:06,319
but but i teach with the quality

5306
03:28:06,319 --> 03:28:08,800
you know just so

5307
03:28:08,800 --> 03:28:10,319
you guys could take this and make

5308
03:28:10,319 --> 03:28:12,960
something of of yourselves and and and

5309
03:28:12,960 --> 03:28:14,880
who you teach this to

5310
03:28:14,880 --> 03:28:17,439
and who learns from this with you

5311
03:28:17,439 --> 03:28:19,359
you know that that's why i

5312
03:28:19,359 --> 03:28:21,120
i teach the things that i do that's why

5313
03:28:21,120 --> 03:28:22,000
i teach

5314
03:28:22,000 --> 03:28:24,800
the way that i do because i want you

5315
03:28:24,800 --> 03:28:26,000
guys to

5316
03:28:26,000 --> 03:28:29,120
to get that to to understand that and

5317
03:28:29,120 --> 03:28:31,279
and to pass it home pay it forward i

5318
03:28:31,279 --> 03:28:32,800
used to watch little movies like that

5319
03:28:32,800 --> 03:28:34,720
moment a movie pay it forward you guys

5320
03:28:34,720 --> 03:28:37,359
haven't watched a great movie

5321
03:28:37,359 --> 03:28:38,479
that's

5322
03:28:38,479 --> 03:28:41,120
my beliefs you know and i'm sorry that

5323
03:28:41,120 --> 03:28:43,840
they may not align with other people um

5324
03:28:43,840 --> 03:28:46,399
but that's my beliefs

5325
03:28:46,399 --> 03:28:48,880
and it's just

5326
03:28:48,880 --> 03:28:50,960
like i worked hard for this you know

5327
03:28:50,960 --> 03:28:54,560
like i abnormal amount of hours

5328
03:28:54,560 --> 03:28:56,560
paid less

5329
03:28:56,560 --> 03:28:59,040
no one paid me

5330
03:28:59,040 --> 03:29:00,880
abnormal so this might have been this

5331
03:29:00,880 --> 03:29:04,560
little s and d zone down here

5332
03:29:04,560 --> 03:29:07,600
right here you see i said most times you

5333
03:29:07,600 --> 03:29:09,920
got to pay attention to at least 50 or

5334
03:29:09,920 --> 03:29:13,359
more this probably went like 61 or so

5335
03:29:13,359 --> 03:29:14,319
yeah

5336
03:29:14,319 --> 03:29:17,760
yeah it's about 61 percent or so

5337
03:29:17,760 --> 03:29:19,200
but you see what i say paying attention

5338
03:29:19,200 --> 03:29:20,640
to these s and d's yeah there's a full

5339
03:29:20,640 --> 03:29:23,279
body smd here but the wick sometimes are

5340
03:29:23,279 --> 03:29:24,880
the hidden zones

5341
03:29:24,880 --> 03:29:26,880
and if you got a tap on the hidden zone

5342
03:29:26,880 --> 03:29:29,120
that hit an snd

5343
03:29:29,120 --> 03:29:30,880
tapped right here

5344
03:29:30,880 --> 03:29:33,680
pushed up look at that gave you 23 pips

5345
03:29:33,680 --> 03:29:35,680
just off of that

5346
03:29:35,680 --> 03:29:38,239
and if you took the regular snd

5347
03:29:38,239 --> 03:29:41,279
just with this alone

5348
03:29:41,580 --> 03:29:43,279
[Music]

5349
03:29:43,279 --> 03:29:45,359
you got to tap in here and i believe

5350
03:29:45,359 --> 03:29:47,359
this had pushed up to here

5351
03:29:47,359 --> 03:29:49,279
29 pips

5352
03:29:49,279 --> 03:29:50,640
and just off of

5353
03:29:50,640 --> 03:29:54,800
the two choices within the same zone

5354
03:29:55,439 --> 03:29:58,000
two choices within the same zone

5355
03:29:58,000 --> 03:30:00,000
we end up running this high

5356
03:30:00,000 --> 03:30:02,319
and running this high made us do what

5357
03:30:02,319 --> 03:30:05,840
tap further into this smd up here

5358
03:30:05,840 --> 03:30:08,080
maybe it was

5359
03:30:08,080 --> 03:30:09,840
this here

5360
03:30:09,840 --> 03:30:11,600
if this hits i'm out

5361
03:30:11,600 --> 03:30:14,800
i'm out i'm out

5362
03:30:15,279 --> 03:30:18,880
i gotta get out of here i gotta

5363
03:30:22,160 --> 03:30:23,840
this is why you i said you could

5364
03:30:23,840 --> 03:30:25,359
literally trade everything like you

5365
03:30:25,359 --> 03:30:26,560
could

5366
03:30:26,560 --> 03:30:28,160
you might encourage some losses a little

5367
03:30:28,160 --> 03:30:30,000
drawdown whatever it is but this is way

5368
03:30:30,000 --> 03:30:32,160
too accurate for you to fail this is

5369
03:30:32,160 --> 03:30:33,279
fail proof

5370
03:30:33,279 --> 03:30:34,880
this is what this is

5371
03:30:34,880 --> 03:30:37,200
the problem is 90 of people won't spend

5372
03:30:37,200 --> 03:30:39,040
time going through these three hour

5373
03:30:39,040 --> 03:30:41,279
videos to learn this and that's why i

5374
03:30:41,279 --> 03:30:42,800
teach the way i do

5375
03:30:42,800 --> 03:30:44,160
i want you to get through these three

5376
03:30:44,160 --> 03:30:45,520
hour videos

5377
03:30:45,520 --> 03:30:47,279
because sometimes all it takes is

5378
03:30:47,279 --> 03:30:49,600
patience watching the market

5379
03:30:49,600 --> 03:30:51,920
like to watch the market this long we

5380
03:30:51,920 --> 03:30:54,640
this was this was three and a half hours

5381
03:30:54,640 --> 03:30:56,000
you guys didn't seem to take a break and

5382
03:30:56,000 --> 03:30:59,520
walk away watching the market this long

5383
03:30:59,520 --> 03:31:02,160
is what taught me this being able to sit

5384
03:31:02,160 --> 03:31:04,080
for a video this

5385
03:31:04,080 --> 03:31:05,279
long

5386
03:31:05,279 --> 03:31:07,600
is what taught me this

5387
03:31:07,600 --> 03:31:09,600
so i'm not telling you guys to do things

5388
03:31:09,600 --> 03:31:12,080
that i haven't done myself

5389
03:31:12,080 --> 03:31:15,439
but this is what taught me this

5390
03:31:15,439 --> 03:31:18,000
i was able to sit here for hours and pay

5391
03:31:18,000 --> 03:31:19,760
attention to this

5392
03:31:19,760 --> 03:31:21,840
pay attention to what's happening for

5393
03:31:21,840 --> 03:31:24,000
hours

5394
03:31:24,000 --> 03:31:26,000
and if you guys can do that too it will

5395
03:31:26,000 --> 03:31:28,080
change your life forever it's the

5396
03:31:28,080 --> 03:31:32,080
discipline factor it's the discipline

5397
03:31:32,080 --> 03:31:34,640
the money is in the information

5398
03:31:34,640 --> 03:31:36,560
but the information can only be

5399
03:31:36,560 --> 03:31:40,399
extracted through one access to it and

5400
03:31:40,399 --> 03:31:41,200
two

5401
03:31:41,200 --> 03:31:43,359
discipline

5402
03:31:43,359 --> 03:31:45,760
discipline

5403
03:31:45,760 --> 03:31:47,840
kamali i love your enthusiasm but you

5404
03:31:47,840 --> 03:31:49,359
gotta learn

5405
03:31:49,359 --> 03:31:50,960
how to

5406
03:31:50,960 --> 03:31:52,880
work this thing you gotta learn how to

5407
03:31:52,880 --> 03:31:55,840
learn this

5408
03:31:57,820 --> 03:31:59,120
[Music]

5409
03:31:59,120 --> 03:32:01,040
look at this it tapped into what this

5410
03:32:01,040 --> 03:32:03,600
fractal

5411
03:32:03,600 --> 03:32:07,200
pushed up back into this area

5412
03:32:07,200 --> 03:32:09,279
might close the imbalance may not but

5413
03:32:09,279 --> 03:32:11,520
may continue up to either further

5414
03:32:11,520 --> 03:32:13,359
mitigate this area

5415
03:32:13,359 --> 03:32:16,800
or to possibly tap into what our special

5416
03:32:16,800 --> 03:32:19,200
area remember what we talked about

5417
03:32:19,200 --> 03:32:22,319
we talked about this area

5418
03:32:22,319 --> 03:32:23,760
where a lot of the times you have a

5419
03:32:23,760 --> 03:32:26,640
rejection coming out of this

5420
03:32:26,640 --> 03:32:29,200
push-up push down straight away

5421
03:32:29,200 --> 03:32:30,640
a lot of times you could have a

5422
03:32:30,640 --> 03:32:34,160
rejection within this area

5423
03:32:34,319 --> 03:32:37,680
there's still not not enough mitigation

5424
03:32:37,680 --> 03:32:40,239
within this but this could be an equal

5425
03:32:40,239 --> 03:32:41,760
high

5426
03:32:41,760 --> 03:32:44,560
only being created to run the low that's

5427
03:32:44,560 --> 03:32:46,399
a possibility

5428
03:32:46,399 --> 03:32:49,120
but you wait and you see what happens

5429
03:32:49,120 --> 03:32:51,359
within these areas yeah this is an equal

5430
03:32:51,359 --> 03:32:54,000
high or this could be an equal high

5431
03:32:54,000 --> 03:32:56,399
but why not learn to trade from the

5432
03:32:56,399 --> 03:32:58,880
zones first

5433
03:32:58,880 --> 03:33:00,880
why not learn to trade from

5434
03:33:00,880 --> 03:33:02,880
fractal from an imbalance

5435
03:33:02,880 --> 03:33:05,359
from the s and d why not trade from

5436
03:33:05,359 --> 03:33:08,960
those those are those are more optimal

5437
03:33:08,960 --> 03:33:10,399
than trying to see if this is going to

5438
03:33:10,399 --> 03:33:13,040
create an equal high

5439
03:33:13,040 --> 03:33:16,080
or if it's going to make an equal low

5440
03:33:16,080 --> 03:33:18,560
these things are more optimal zones

5441
03:33:18,560 --> 03:33:20,560
and when you factor in imbalance and

5442
03:33:20,560 --> 03:33:22,399
when you factor in displacement and when

5443
03:33:22,399 --> 03:33:25,040
you factor in y golf and when you factor

5444
03:33:25,040 --> 03:33:27,520
in supply and demand areas when you

5445
03:33:27,520 --> 03:33:31,279
factor all of this together you get this

5446
03:33:31,279 --> 03:33:32,720
you get this

5447
03:33:32,720 --> 03:33:34,560
so as i mentioned we could

5448
03:33:34,560 --> 03:33:36,640
end up running the high here

5449
03:33:36,640 --> 03:33:38,479
but then we could also come back and run

5450
03:33:38,479 --> 03:33:39,680
the low

5451
03:33:39,680 --> 03:33:41,920
there's a possibility of that too

5452
03:33:41,920 --> 03:33:43,439
and on a higher time frame that would

5453
03:33:43,439 --> 03:33:45,600
make this consistent with an equal low i

5454
03:33:45,600 --> 03:33:47,040
mean an equal high

5455
03:33:47,040 --> 03:33:48,399
that ends up

5456
03:33:48,399 --> 03:33:50,560
taking us back down then we could find

5457
03:33:50,560 --> 03:33:52,640
an equal low somewhere down here and end

5458
03:33:52,640 --> 03:33:54,399
up running the high

5459
03:33:54,399 --> 03:33:56,080
and that could be

5460
03:33:56,080 --> 03:33:58,239
the flow of it

5461
03:33:58,239 --> 03:34:00,800
but you just have to know

5462
03:34:00,800 --> 03:34:01,760
what

5463
03:34:01,760 --> 03:34:04,479
what the order flow is first before

5464
03:34:04,479 --> 03:34:06,560
engaging into the market

5465
03:34:06,560 --> 03:34:07,520
learn

5466
03:34:07,520 --> 03:34:09,040
order flow

5467
03:34:09,040 --> 03:34:10,399
first

5468
03:34:10,399 --> 03:34:12,640
once you learn order flow it helps you

5469
03:34:12,640 --> 03:34:14,800
look at this i have mentioned that this

5470
03:34:14,800 --> 03:34:16,880
wasn't mitigated as much

5471
03:34:16,880 --> 03:34:19,040
this still could be further mitigated

5472
03:34:19,040 --> 03:34:22,160
what did we do we got a tap right on

5473
03:34:22,160 --> 03:34:24,239
here

5474
03:34:24,239 --> 03:34:26,560
within this area to further mitigate and

5475
03:34:26,560 --> 03:34:28,479
what we started pushing down

5476
03:34:28,479 --> 03:34:31,040
to where maybe this imbalance who knows

5477
03:34:31,040 --> 03:34:33,200
maybe it just rips through that area or

5478
03:34:33,200 --> 03:34:35,200
maybe it just pushes back up to the

5479
03:34:35,200 --> 03:34:37,760
actual snd that's above we don't know

5480
03:34:37,760 --> 03:34:40,560
that but what we do know is

5481
03:34:40,560 --> 03:34:41,439
that

5482
03:34:41,439 --> 03:34:44,560
price has these rules that it follows

5483
03:34:44,560 --> 03:34:46,239
look this is getting rejected from a

5484
03:34:46,239 --> 03:34:48,800
mini imbalance that's within here tapped

5485
03:34:48,800 --> 03:34:51,840
up got a quick rejection away from it

5486
03:34:51,840 --> 03:34:52,640
from

5487
03:34:52,640 --> 03:34:55,120
right in between these two candles tiny

5488
03:34:55,120 --> 03:34:57,359
imbalance in there tap there quickly

5489
03:34:57,359 --> 03:34:59,359
reject it away now you have another

5490
03:34:59,359 --> 03:35:01,680
push-up where possibly to this s and d

5491
03:35:01,680 --> 03:35:03,600
and mind you we have one hidden right up

5492
03:35:03,600 --> 03:35:05,120
above

5493
03:35:05,120 --> 03:35:09,800
most people don't don't look at these

5494
03:35:11,200 --> 03:35:13,600
one hidden up above will price get

5495
03:35:13,600 --> 03:35:15,120
there's a possibility price guess

5496
03:35:15,120 --> 03:35:18,160
there's a possibility price doesn't

5497
03:35:18,160 --> 03:35:18,960
but

5498
03:35:18,960 --> 03:35:21,359
hidden s d zones

5499
03:35:21,359 --> 03:35:25,120
why not trade from the zones

5500
03:35:25,120 --> 03:35:29,200
why try to chase why try to you know

5501
03:35:29,200 --> 03:35:31,200
jump in when it's going to or coming

5502
03:35:31,200 --> 03:35:33,279
from when zones are more optimal they

5503
03:35:33,279 --> 03:35:35,680
have faster reactions

5504
03:35:35,680 --> 03:35:37,439
so if you jump in you can be in drawdown

5505
03:35:37,439 --> 03:35:39,600
a little bit you can be you know sitting

5506
03:35:39,600 --> 03:35:41,600
around that area because you jumped in

5507
03:35:41,600 --> 03:35:43,040
price is waiting

5508
03:35:43,040 --> 03:35:45,200
to go wherever it's going

5509
03:35:45,200 --> 03:35:47,680
but you jumped in

5510
03:35:47,680 --> 03:35:50,399
and you can jump in and you see that you

5511
03:35:50,399 --> 03:35:52,080
get some profit or you could jump in and

5512
03:35:52,080 --> 03:35:53,840
price can just sit around that area the

5513
03:35:53,840 --> 03:35:55,439
entire time

5514
03:35:55,439 --> 03:35:57,600
but with these areas price quickly

5515
03:35:57,600 --> 03:36:00,800
rejects away from them quickly

5516
03:36:00,800 --> 03:36:03,120
there's another i told you guys s and d

5517
03:36:03,120 --> 03:36:04,080
zone

5518
03:36:04,080 --> 03:36:07,040
oftentimes which you have is a tap at

5519
03:36:07,040 --> 03:36:09,120
the bottom of it

5520
03:36:09,120 --> 03:36:11,760
mark these things out on your chart when

5521
03:36:11,760 --> 03:36:14,319
you see them

5522
03:36:14,319 --> 03:36:15,680
look at this tap

5523
03:36:15,680 --> 03:36:17,040
from the zone

5524
03:36:17,040 --> 03:36:18,319
i told you you get a tap from the

5525
03:36:18,319 --> 03:36:19,760
beginning of it you might get a

5526
03:36:19,760 --> 03:36:22,080
mitigation in the middle of it

5527
03:36:22,080 --> 03:36:24,239
or you might get a push through

5528
03:36:24,239 --> 03:36:27,680
depending on the zone above

5529
03:36:28,560 --> 03:36:30,560
and if you just utilize these principles

5530
03:36:30,560 --> 03:36:32,319
y'all like

5531
03:36:32,319 --> 03:36:35,279
your life is changing forever i promise

5532
03:36:35,279 --> 03:36:37,439
that

5533
03:36:37,439 --> 03:36:40,239
that if you take these and apply them to

5534
03:36:40,239 --> 03:36:43,920
your own trading in whatever market you

5535
03:36:43,920 --> 03:36:46,319
trade in whatever market it doesn't

5536
03:36:46,319 --> 03:36:49,600
matter what what is this uh um

5537
03:36:49,600 --> 03:36:53,680
let's see let's find amazon maybe

5538
03:36:57,600 --> 03:37:00,239
whatever market you're in whatever

5539
03:37:00,239 --> 03:37:03,600
market you're trading in whatever market

5540
03:37:03,600 --> 03:37:06,880
you're in tap we go return to the entry

5541
03:37:06,880 --> 03:37:09,840
a second time then we leave so we get a

5542
03:37:09,840 --> 03:37:13,200
scalp on the first one bam here we come

5543
03:37:13,200 --> 03:37:16,720
up we get another entry here we see the

5544
03:37:16,720 --> 03:37:19,439
bullish flip it makes the flip takes us

5545
03:37:19,439 --> 03:37:21,279
back into this zone with our stops

5546
03:37:21,279 --> 03:37:23,200
directly behind here and then what do we

5547
03:37:23,200 --> 03:37:27,279
do we end up in a longer trade

5548
03:37:27,600 --> 03:37:29,120
because we

5549
03:37:29,120 --> 03:37:32,160
got the i told you consolidation is only

5550
03:37:32,160 --> 03:37:33,840
telling you a story of what's happening

5551
03:37:33,840 --> 03:37:35,760
with price

5552
03:37:35,760 --> 03:37:38,160
that have been here exactly immediately

5553
03:37:38,160 --> 03:37:40,239
like that this is this is amazon by the

5554
03:37:40,239 --> 03:37:41,520
way

5555
03:37:41,520 --> 03:37:44,840
this is amazon

5556
03:37:46,880 --> 03:37:48,319
amazon

5557
03:37:48,319 --> 03:37:50,000
we can do it within here too these

5558
03:37:50,000 --> 03:37:51,359
little things here like it doesn't

5559
03:37:51,359 --> 03:37:53,760
matter w wherever we are that that's

5560
03:37:53,760 --> 03:37:55,920
amazon on the stock exchange for for new

5561
03:37:55,920 --> 03:37:58,920
york

5562
03:37:59,200 --> 03:38:01,600
and go to amazon on on other other

5563
03:38:01,600 --> 03:38:03,520
things

5564
03:38:03,520 --> 03:38:05,600
other things

5565
03:38:05,600 --> 03:38:08,160
look at this

5566
03:38:08,720 --> 03:38:12,200
tap my line

5567
03:38:13,600 --> 03:38:16,080
bam

5568
03:38:16,800 --> 03:38:20,000
tapped in for short

5569
03:38:20,000 --> 03:38:22,720
everything it doesn't this is amazon on

5570
03:38:22,720 --> 03:38:24,880
another exchange this ain't even

5571
03:38:24,880 --> 03:38:27,680
new york's exchange

5572
03:38:27,680 --> 03:38:31,040
anything anywhere no matter what it is

5573
03:38:31,040 --> 03:38:33,439
no matter how it moves no matter if it's

5574
03:38:33,439 --> 03:38:35,359
manipulated or not

5575
03:38:35,359 --> 03:38:37,920
anything

5576
03:38:38,080 --> 03:38:38,880
so

5577

i i want you guys to

5578
03:38:42,239 --> 03:38:45,359
i want you guys to allow me

5579
03:38:45,359 --> 03:38:47,920
to finish drinking my coffee when i come

5580
03:38:47,920 --> 03:38:50,239
into the charts okay

5581
03:38:50,239 --> 03:38:51,840
i love you

5582
03:38:51,840 --> 03:38:54,479
i'm kidding i want you guys to to

5583
03:38:54,479 --> 03:38:56,800
like look at this

5584
03:38:56,800 --> 03:38:58,560
see how it moves

5585
03:38:58,560 --> 03:39:00,319
look at what you can do with price look

5586
03:39:00,319 --> 03:39:02,239
at this i mentioned this this morning

5587
03:39:02,239 --> 03:39:04,000
that i just randomly saw this if

5588
03:39:04,000 --> 03:39:06,640
somebody actually traded oil

5589
03:39:06,640 --> 03:39:08,560
and been like where where would you get

5590
03:39:08,560 --> 03:39:10,479
in like obviously you know where to get

5591
03:39:10,479 --> 03:39:12,960
in you know on the top of the line

5592
03:39:12,960 --> 03:39:14,720
but this was the first opportunity to

5593
03:39:14,720 --> 03:39:16,640
get in here

5594
03:39:16,640 --> 03:39:18,880
with a 26 pip stop

5595
03:39:18,880 --> 03:39:20,720
and look at how look at how far down

5596
03:39:20,720 --> 03:39:23,840
this bad boy went

5597
03:39:25,600 --> 03:39:26,720
look at this

5598
03:39:26,720 --> 03:39:29,680
this is outrageous

5599
03:39:30,479 --> 03:39:32,160
just on the one minute

5600
03:39:32,160 --> 03:39:34,880
with this kind of stop

5601
03:39:34,880 --> 03:39:37,120
and if

5602
03:39:37,120 --> 03:39:39,359
if you were in earlier

5603
03:39:39,359 --> 03:39:41,920
we mentioned the top of

5604
03:39:41,920 --> 03:39:44,399
this zone here right behind

5605
03:39:44,399 --> 03:39:45,760
this wick here

5606
03:39:45,760 --> 03:39:47,680
and you're just taking it to see okay

5607
03:39:47,680 --> 03:39:49,600
where it's going i told you once you get

5608
03:39:49,600 --> 03:39:50,960
tapped in and price moves away and it

5609
03:39:50,960 --> 03:39:53,120
starts to consolidate that none of your

5610
03:39:53,120 --> 03:39:54,560
bit this is none of your business down

5611
03:39:54,560 --> 03:39:55,439
here

5612
03:39:55,439 --> 03:39:57,600
where this is consolidating none of your

5613
03:39:57,600 --> 03:39:58,960
business at all

5614
03:39:58,960 --> 03:40:01,040
because you already got in on the tap

5615
03:40:01,040 --> 03:40:03,199
and if it tapped and took you away and

5616
03:40:03,199 --> 03:40:05,040
did not quickly trade back and started

5617
03:40:05,040 --> 03:40:07,600
consolidating it could be moving away

5618
03:40:07,600 --> 03:40:10,560
from that trade so look at this

5619
03:40:10,560 --> 03:40:12,800
if you just held on to this trade this

5620
03:40:12,800 --> 03:40:15,380
is a 1 to 24

5621
03:40:15,380 --> 03:40:16,720
[Music]

5622
03:40:16,720 --> 03:40:21,760
and this one here is a 1 to 83

5623
03:40:21,760 --> 03:40:26,160
oh sorry 81 1 to 81.

5624
03:40:26,160 --> 03:40:27,680
people think that this stuff is fake

5625
03:40:27,680 --> 03:40:29,840
like you you can't really call this this

5626
03:40:29,840 --> 03:40:33,040
type of thing no you can

5627
03:40:33,040 --> 03:40:34,880
it matters about where you start what

5628
03:40:34,880 --> 03:40:37,600
your rules are and and where we're going

5629
03:40:37,600 --> 03:40:38,880
now i didn't know price was going all

5630
03:40:38,880 --> 03:40:40,560
the way down here but price still didn't

5631
03:40:40,560 --> 03:40:42,399
give me any indication within here that

5632
03:40:42,399 --> 03:40:44,160
we were flipping bullish maybe right

5633
03:40:44,160 --> 03:40:45,359
here i would have thought that we were

5634
03:40:45,359 --> 03:40:47,120
flipping bullish but look this i know

5635
03:40:47,120 --> 03:40:48,479
there's an imbalance in here that i got

5636
03:40:48,479 --> 03:40:50,960
rejected from let me go down and see

5637
03:40:50,960 --> 03:40:53,680
let me prove myself wrong real quick

5638
03:40:53,680 --> 03:40:56,479
because i am wrong

5639
03:40:58,840 --> 03:41:01,600
sometimes right here

5640
03:41:01,600 --> 03:41:04,479
you see price almost touches the 50 of

5641
03:41:04,479 --> 03:41:06,720
the imbalance but i told you guys before

5642
03:41:06,720 --> 03:41:08,640
sometimes it would just

5643
03:41:08,640 --> 03:41:11,199
come into the area almost touching and

5644
03:41:11,199 --> 03:41:12,960
leave out of it it doesn't always hit

5645
03:41:12,960 --> 03:41:15,840
the 50 and go

5646
03:41:16,399 --> 03:41:17,600
but

5647
03:41:17,600 --> 03:41:21,040
another imbalance play in here

5648
03:41:21,040 --> 03:41:22,560
right here

5649
03:41:22,560 --> 03:41:24,319
here

5650
03:41:24,319 --> 03:41:26,640
to here another imbalanced play here

5651
03:41:26,640 --> 03:41:29,840
rejected away price pushers up run these

5652
03:41:29,840 --> 03:41:33,920
highs i'm all the way up here if i'm in

5653
03:41:33,920 --> 03:41:36,080
why do i care about what's happening

5654
03:41:36,080 --> 03:41:38,640
here maybe if it came like halfway to

5655
03:41:38,640 --> 03:41:39,760
where i'm at

5656
03:41:39,760 --> 03:41:42,000
but then i'm continuing short once i see

5657
03:41:42,000 --> 03:41:43,359
that there's a breakdown and it goes

5658
03:41:43,359 --> 03:41:45,120
short

5659
03:41:45,120 --> 03:41:46,880
so you could manage

5660
03:41:46,880 --> 03:41:50,479
while you're in a trade and take it at a

5661
03:41:50,479 --> 03:41:52,399
distance you didn't know it was coming

5662
03:41:52,399 --> 03:41:53,760
here you didn't like

5663
03:41:53,760 --> 03:41:55,920
you have any indication oh i know it's

5664
03:41:55,920 --> 03:41:57,279
going to you didn't know it was going

5665
03:41:57,279 --> 03:41:58,080
there

5666
03:41:58,080 --> 03:42:00,000
i didn't know what was going there

5667
03:42:00,000 --> 03:42:02,239
but we found an opportunity and we

5668
03:42:02,239 --> 03:42:04,319
watched price we just looked at what

5669
03:42:04,319 --> 03:42:06,479
price was doing even if it's your full

5670
03:42:06,479 --> 03:42:08,319
tp that went to some of those areas or

5671
03:42:08,319 --> 03:42:09,600
is your runners that went to some of

5672
03:42:09,600 --> 03:42:10,880
those areas

5673
03:42:10,880 --> 03:42:12,960
it doesn't matter what it is

5674
03:42:12,960 --> 03:42:15,279
we didn't have any idea of of that

5675
03:42:15,279 --> 03:42:18,160
actually happening but

5676
03:42:18,160 --> 03:42:20,399
but

5677
03:42:20,479 --> 03:42:23,680
but what did we do

5678
03:42:23,680 --> 03:42:24,820
look at this come on

5679
03:42:24,820 --> 03:42:26,640
[Music]

5680
03:42:26,640 --> 03:42:28,319
i'm done i'm not streaming for the next

5681
03:42:28,319 --> 03:42:30,479
three weeks i'm done

5682
03:42:30,479 --> 03:42:33,040
this video was more than enough

5683
03:42:33,040 --> 03:42:35,279
for people to come and sit and learn so

5684
03:42:35,279 --> 03:42:36,880
much from watching this

5685
03:42:36,880 --> 03:42:40,239
over and over and over again

5686
03:42:40,239 --> 03:42:41,680
look at this

5687
03:42:41,680 --> 03:42:43,199
imbalance fill

5688
03:42:43,199 --> 03:42:45,439
or

5689
03:42:47,120 --> 03:42:49,520
tap into the smd

5690
03:42:49,520 --> 03:42:52,000
the beginning of it

5691
03:42:52,000 --> 03:42:54,720
what do we do go back up where do we go

5692
03:42:54,720 --> 03:42:57,439
back up to remember i mentioned a little

5693
03:42:57,439 --> 03:42:59,520
lovely spot here that we could

5694
03:42:59,520 --> 03:43:02,239
potentially be going to to tap into

5695
03:43:02,239 --> 03:43:05,520
lovely spot bam right there

5696
03:43:05,520 --> 03:43:06,800
look at this

5697
03:43:06,800 --> 03:43:08,239
from s d

5698
03:43:08,239 --> 03:43:09,600
to s d

5699
03:43:09,600 --> 03:43:12,319
68 pips

5700
03:43:12,319 --> 03:43:14,960
you get a tap here

5701
03:43:14,960 --> 03:43:17,120
already 25 pips in profit

5702
03:43:17,120 --> 03:43:19,040
watch it as an imbalance here so it

5703
03:43:19,040 --> 03:43:19,760
could

5704
03:43:19,760 --> 03:43:20,720
you know

5705
03:43:20,720 --> 03:43:22,479
make a u-turn from there there's also a

5706
03:43:22,479 --> 03:43:25,439
fractal here and an s and d within here

5707
03:43:25,439 --> 03:43:28,880
so that makes this area a likely area to

5708
03:43:28,880 --> 03:43:31,199
kind of have a rejection out of with all

5709
03:43:31,199 --> 03:43:33,120
of this stuff going on and it can just

5710
03:43:33,120 --> 03:43:35,120
be a quick rejection

5711
03:43:35,120 --> 03:43:37,600
a quick scout coming out of this area

5712
03:43:37,600 --> 03:43:38,880
here

5713
03:43:38,880 --> 03:43:40,560
because of

5714
03:43:40,560 --> 03:43:43,199
all of these things going on within it

5715
03:43:43,199 --> 03:43:44,960
and the possibility of all of this and

5716
03:43:44,960 --> 03:43:46,479
let's say price just continued to go

5717
03:43:46,479 --> 03:43:47,279
down

5718
03:43:47,279 --> 03:43:49,840
let's say price just just shifted down

5719
03:43:49,840 --> 03:43:52,479
and broke the low within here

5720
03:43:52,479 --> 03:43:55,279
there's also a possibility that if if

5721
03:43:55,279 --> 03:43:58,319
you were buying up into here that price

5722
03:43:58,319 --> 03:44:01,199
would shift back up into this area get

5723
03:44:01,199 --> 03:44:04,960
you out at break even before going

5724
03:44:05,199 --> 03:44:07,359
but this i mean

5725
03:44:07,359 --> 03:44:09,439
is is here for you guys you know like

5726
03:44:09,439 --> 03:44:11,840

videos over the last two days

5730
03:44:18,640 --> 03:44:20,560

than enough

5735
03:44:27,279 --> 03:44:28,560
and look at this

5736
03:44:28,560 --> 03:44:29,600

so we went we went what was this uh uh

5740
03:44:40,239 --> 03:44:43,439
68 pips up

5741
03:44:43,600 --> 03:44:45,920
just for a turnaround

5742
03:44:45,920 --> 03:44:47,840
of

5743
03:44:47,840 --> 03:44:50,960
86 pips down

5744
03:44:54,399 --> 03:44:56,080
crazy

5745
03:44:56,080 --> 03:44:56,880

03:45:31,279 --> 03:45:33,920
highs running the low yeah we got that

5763
03:45:33,920 --> 03:45:36,960
just now you know we got the tap there

5764
03:45:36,960 --> 03:45:38,720
left out of there there's a little

5765
03:45:38,720 --> 03:45:41,120
imbalance within here so be careful of

5766
03:45:41,120 --> 03:45:44,239
that um we just tapped into this small s

5767
03:45:44,239 --> 03:45:46,160
and d zone that's down here the hidden

5768
03:45:46,160 --> 03:45:48,080
one so we got a little reaction off of

5769
03:45:48,080 --> 03:45:50,239
that like this there's always reasons

5770
03:45:50,239 --> 03:45:52,319
why price reacts the way it does

5771
03:45:52,319 --> 03:45:53,920
you know this can try to continue to

5772
03:45:53,920 --> 03:45:55,760
come up and feel the imbalance but if it

5773
03:45:55,760 --> 03:45:57,600
leaves it behind i could feel it later

5774
03:45:57,600 --> 03:45:59,600
after tapping into an area below you

5775
03:45:59,600 --> 03:46:00,720
know like this

5776
03:46:00,720 --> 03:46:03,600
just i see this so many times that that

5777
03:46:03,600 --> 03:46:05,920
like i said if you woke me up at 9 00 am

5778
03:46:05,920 --> 03:46:08,399
no sorry no name if you woke me up at

5779
03:46:08,399 --> 03:46:11,040
3 a.m eastern standard time it's like

5780
03:46:11,040 --> 03:46:13,359
where is price now or else i'm gonna

5781
03:46:13,359 --> 03:46:14,960
shoot you i'll tell you exactly where

5782
03:46:14,960 --> 03:46:17,040
price is

5783
03:46:17,040 --> 03:46:18,560
because i've spent so much time in the

5784
03:46:18,560 --> 03:46:20,239
market to know what

5785
03:46:20,239 --> 03:46:22,800
the movements are even through the night

5786
03:46:22,800 --> 03:46:24,960
you know so

5787
03:46:24,960 --> 03:46:27,920
you're welcome guys um

5788
03:46:27,920 --> 03:46:30,800
i look forward to having you guys back

5789
03:46:30,800 --> 03:46:32,960
you know on monday

5790
03:46:32,960 --> 03:46:34,880
i might consider on sunday start doing

5791
03:46:34,880 --> 03:46:36,560
like weekly outlooks from the higher

5792
03:46:36,560 --> 03:46:39,680
time frames i don't know i'll see but um

5793
03:46:39,680 --> 03:46:40,960
i was

5794
03:46:40,960 --> 03:46:42,800
glad to be able to do this with you guys

5795
03:46:42,800 --> 03:46:45,439
i'm always happy to to do this with you

5796
03:46:45,439 --> 03:46:47,520
guys i'm always grateful that you guys

5797
03:46:47,520 --> 03:46:49,040
come and listen to me i told you my own

5798
03:46:49,040 --> 03:46:50,880
kids don't listen to me so i'm happy

5799
03:46:50,880 --> 03:46:52,640
about that um

5800
03:46:52,640 --> 03:46:53,840
and uh

5801
03:46:53,840 --> 03:46:56,800
i just want us to to become profitable

5802
03:46:56,800 --> 03:46:58,399
together you know

5803
03:46:58,399 --> 03:46:59,760
so hopefully when we get this group

5804
03:46:59,760 --> 03:47:02,640
started we could definitely um

5805
03:47:02,640 --> 03:47:05,920
uh analyze can you analyze btc

5806
03:47:05,920 --> 03:47:08,000
oh i i do everything you want me to

5807
03:47:08,000 --> 03:47:09,840
analyze a rock i will

5808
03:47:09,840 --> 03:47:11,359
i do everything what time frame do you

5809
03:47:11,359 --> 03:47:13,760
want me to analyze bitcoin on

5810
03:47:13,760 --> 03:47:15,199
because we have we actually went through

5811
03:47:15,199 --> 03:47:17,760
an analysis during this video um for a

5812
03:47:17,760 --> 03:47:19,439
bitcoin actually

5813
03:47:19,439 --> 03:47:22,319
i think um

5814
03:47:22,479 --> 03:47:24,560
is this still here let me just double

5815
03:47:24,560 --> 03:47:27,199
check and see

5816
03:47:30,640 --> 03:47:33,040
yeah we we had this bounce here from

5817
03:47:33,040 --> 03:47:34,720
across the way

5818
03:47:34,720 --> 03:47:36,160
something about oh the imbalance that

5819
03:47:36,160 --> 03:47:38,080
was here so it bounced off of the

5820
03:47:38,080 --> 03:47:40,319
imbalance but then we also talked about

5821
03:47:40,319 --> 03:47:42,880
the s and d that's down here too

5822
03:47:42,880 --> 03:47:45,680
and this s d was responsible for

5823
03:47:45,680 --> 03:47:48,640
the structural break above so that's why

5824
03:47:48,640 --> 03:47:50,640
we kind of signal that out

5825
03:47:50,640 --> 03:47:52,239
um

5826
03:47:52,239 --> 03:47:54,720
so that's here

5827
03:47:54,720 --> 03:47:56,720
somewhere within here

5828
03:47:56,720 --> 03:47:58,239
um

5829
03:47:58,239 --> 03:47:59,680
you know we talked about this hitting

5830
03:47:59,680 --> 03:48:02,319
the imbalance it already did here oh

5831
03:48:02,319 --> 03:48:03,920
what am i doing

5832
03:48:03,920 --> 03:48:07,520
hitting the imbalance here

5833
03:48:08,319 --> 03:48:11,520
and um after the imbalance we had a huge

5834
03:48:11,520 --> 03:48:12,840
push up

5835
03:48:12,840 --> 03:48:15,760
into um this area up here i don't

5836
03:48:15,760 --> 03:48:18,160
remember if this was a daily or a four

5837
03:48:18,160 --> 03:48:19,359
hour

5838
03:48:19,359 --> 03:48:21,600
um

5839
03:48:23,120 --> 03:48:26,000
smd zone yeah it was a four hour s d

5840
03:48:26,000 --> 03:48:29,800
zone right here

5841
03:48:30,479 --> 03:48:32,479
you see a perfect tap got a rejection

5842
03:48:32,479 --> 03:48:33,439
away

5843
03:48:33,439 --> 03:48:35,439
um

5844
03:48:35,439 --> 03:48:38,000
so this could be coming down

5845
03:48:38,000 --> 03:48:40,560
tap into the area again

5846
03:48:40,560 --> 03:48:43,120
to try and make its way back up

5847
03:48:43,120 --> 03:48:44,640
um

5848
03:48:44,640 --> 03:48:46,479
if it doesn't then it ends up just

5849
03:48:46,479 --> 03:48:48,399
falling down to this area you possibly

5850
03:48:48,399 --> 03:48:51,040
have another tap within this area but

5851
03:48:51,040 --> 03:48:53,520
you do have a you do have quite a bit of

5852
03:48:53,520 --> 03:48:56,800
imbalance um within this area here

5853
03:48:56,800 --> 03:48:59,040
so um price could try to make a reach

5854
03:48:59,040 --> 03:49:01,439
back up into this area

5855
03:49:01,439 --> 03:49:03,920
before continuing short

5856
03:49:03,920 --> 03:49:06,960
um so i had this marked out a lot a very

5857
03:49:06,960 --> 03:49:10,560
very long time ago um this area here

5858
03:49:10,560 --> 03:49:12,800
um

5859
03:49:13,840 --> 03:49:15,359
look

5860
03:49:15,359 --> 03:49:19,359
so i this was a long time ago that i i

5861
03:49:19,359 --> 03:49:23,359
drew this like months back you know

5862
03:49:23,359 --> 03:49:25,120
but i talked about bitcoin coming down

5863
03:49:25,120 --> 03:49:27,600
to 11 000 possibly and

5864
03:49:27,600 --> 03:49:30,319
um even possibly a little lower but i

5865
03:49:30,319 --> 03:49:32,239
had this area because this area is

5866
03:49:32,239 --> 03:49:34,640
responsible for the highs being ran

5867
03:49:34,640 --> 03:49:37,199
um there's also this slight area here

5868
03:49:37,199 --> 03:49:40,080
too which is in the 13 14 000 range but

5869
03:49:40,080 --> 03:49:43,199
um i drew this months ago like a bunch

5870
03:49:43,199 --> 03:49:45,199
of months ago i can't even remember when

5871
03:49:45,199 --> 03:49:47,840
did i write the date or anything this is

5872
03:49:47,840 --> 03:49:51,520
off the monthly chart actually

5873
03:49:51,520 --> 03:49:53,680
yeah

5874
03:49:53,680 --> 03:49:55,920
yeah so i drew this months ago you see

5875
03:49:55,920 --> 03:49:57,359
snd down here

5876
03:49:57,359 --> 03:49:58,560
months ago

5877
03:49:58,560 --> 03:50:00,399
and i said that um

5878
03:50:00,399 --> 03:50:02,319
monthly demand i expect bitcoin to

5879
03:50:02,319 --> 03:50:05,120
rebalance in this area for new highs

5880
03:50:05,120 --> 03:50:06,320
and um we've

5881
03:50:06,320 --> 03:50:07,520
[Music]

5882
03:50:07,520 --> 03:50:09,120
we were like

5883
03:50:09,120 --> 03:50:10,960
up here maybe

5884
03:50:10,960 --> 03:50:13,920
we started going bearish up here

5885
03:50:13,920 --> 03:50:14,960
but look

5886
03:50:14,960 --> 03:50:16,720
equal highs

5887
03:50:16,720 --> 03:50:18,560
ran the first low

5888
03:50:18,560 --> 03:50:21,040
we just want to be careful of this area

5889
03:50:21,040 --> 03:50:23,359
not to have to possibly run the next low

5890
03:50:23,359 --> 03:50:24,399
at

5891
03:50:24,399 --> 03:50:27,199
you know pandemic levels 3 000.

5892
03:50:27,199 --> 03:50:29,920
so um yeah this this was my analysis on

5893
03:50:29,920 --> 03:50:31,120
it you know

5894
03:50:31,120 --> 03:50:32,640
and

5895
03:50:32,640 --> 03:50:35,040
it's it's been it's been delivering

5896
03:50:35,040 --> 03:50:36,960
you know since i've i've

5897
03:50:36,960 --> 03:50:39,520
been that way since i i haven't

5898
03:50:39,520 --> 03:50:41,040
you know really mentioned anything

5899
03:50:41,040 --> 03:50:42,720
different i did think that we were gonna

5900
03:50:42,720 --> 03:50:44,479
make it make it up to some of these

5901
03:50:44,479 --> 03:50:46,800
areas but um this is where fundamentals

5902
03:50:46,800 --> 03:50:49,199
come in you had um

5903
03:50:49,199 --> 03:50:51,760
celsius and all these other companies

5904
03:50:51,760 --> 03:50:53,920
doing certain things um certain shady

5905
03:50:53,920 --> 03:50:56,080
practices that caused the sell-off in

5906
03:50:56,080 --> 03:50:57,520
price

5907
03:50:57,520 --> 03:51:00,960
bitcoin is still um useful crypto is

5908
03:51:00,960 --> 03:51:02,960
useful in general it's just that it

5909
03:51:02,960 --> 03:51:05,199
needs some regulation and and

5910
03:51:05,199 --> 03:51:07,439
structuring to it and

5911
03:51:07,439 --> 03:51:09,520
you know once we get that then

5912
03:51:09,520 --> 03:51:10,960
it's it's essentially going to be the

5913
03:51:10,960 --> 03:51:12,880
future regardless of what people want to

5914
03:51:12,880 --> 03:51:15,439
think now um it may not be bitcoin but

5915
03:51:15,439 --> 03:51:18,000
it could definitely be crypto um it

5916
03:51:18,000 --> 03:51:20,640
certainly is crypto ethereum has a space

5917
03:51:20,640 --> 03:51:23,600
in it uh xrp has a space in corporate

5918
03:51:23,600 --> 03:51:25,199
and corporate always drives a lot of

5919
03:51:25,199 --> 03:51:27,120
money so you want to you know look out

5920
03:51:27,120 --> 03:51:28,399
for that and

5921
03:51:28,399 --> 03:51:30,000
you know speak with your financial

5922
03:51:30,000 --> 03:51:32,239
advisor about owning some of it and by

5923
03:51:32,239 --> 03:51:34,160
the way this is a great segue into this

5924
03:51:34,160 --> 03:51:36,239
is not financial advice nothing i teach

5925
03:51:36,239 --> 03:51:38,000
on this channel is financial advice it's

5926
03:51:38,000 --> 03:51:40,720
just strictly teaching you about

5927
03:51:40,720 --> 03:51:41,600
um

5928
03:51:41,600 --> 03:51:44,319
the education of market analysis that's

5929
03:51:44,319 --> 03:51:46,239
it whatever decisions you make is the

5930
03:51:46,239 --> 03:51:48,239
risk that you choose to take

5931
03:51:48,239 --> 03:51:50,479
and that's on you but there's no

5932
03:51:50,479 --> 03:51:52,319
financial advice here the discord won't

5933
03:51:52,319 --> 03:51:54,880
be any financial advice not now not ever

5934
03:51:54,880 --> 03:51:56,479
we will never be offering financial

5935
03:51:56,479 --> 03:51:58,239
advice to anyone unless we become

5936
03:51:58,239 --> 03:51:59,840
financial advisors

5937
03:51:59,840 --> 03:52:00,720
uh

5938
03:52:00,720 --> 03:52:04,080
the lady name that is on you

5939
03:52:04,080 --> 03:52:06,720
100 bill

5940
03:52:06,720 --> 03:52:09,600
oh wow i didn't know that i had no idea

5941
03:52:09,600 --> 03:52:11,840
that the lady's name that was on the 100

5942
03:52:11,840 --> 03:52:13,600
bills on ripple she's on the board of

5943
03:52:13,600 --> 03:52:16,080
ripple i didn't know that but ripple

5944
03:52:16,080 --> 03:52:17,840
i've been saying that it's the future

5945
03:52:17,840 --> 03:52:19,359
like i've been saying that since the

5946
03:52:19,359 --> 03:52:21,439
conception of it since it's like at 14

5947
03:52:21,439 --> 03:52:23,920
cents or five cents or whatever i've

5948
03:52:23,920 --> 03:52:26,239
been screaming about ripple since long

5949
03:52:26,239 --> 03:52:28,080
ago

5950
03:52:28,080 --> 03:52:30,720
taking pictures yeah

5951
03:52:30,720 --> 03:52:32,640
no but for us that's it you know like

5952
03:52:32,640 --> 03:52:34,000
that

5953
03:52:34,000 --> 03:52:36,160
this is the analysis that i have on on

5954
03:52:36,160 --> 03:52:38,560
bitcoin um like i said if we get a

5955
03:52:38,560 --> 03:52:40,239
double bottom within this area then we

5956
03:52:40,239 --> 03:52:42,319
could potentially push back up to fill

5957
03:52:42,319 --> 03:52:44,479
some of the imbalances that's within

5958
03:52:44,479 --> 03:52:47,439
this area in a higher time frame um

5959
03:52:47,439 --> 03:52:49,359
but i still have it short and and

5960
03:52:49,359 --> 03:52:51,680
overall you know i have a short

5961
03:52:51,680 --> 03:52:55,279
rebalancing in that area at least so um

5962
03:52:55,279 --> 03:52:56,960

5981
03:53:28,479 --> 03:53:30,560
longer to get his stuff across meanwhile
