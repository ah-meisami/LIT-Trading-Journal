1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,399
you know what got me into trading I

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,799
don't think I shared this with you guys

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,799
what got me into like not not trading

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:08,700
but

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,860
like finding

6
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:12,900
something else

7
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:15,960
is that I was always

8
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:18,900
the Uber Facts guy at work

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,720
so I worked in a cubicle

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,640
there was

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:26,460
five other women in the cubicle one as

12
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:30,240
my supervisor and four others as you my

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:33,660
co-workers colleagues uh whatever you

14
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:35,700
call the people on the same level as you

15
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,680
and um

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,300
I would always come in in the morning

17
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:42,000
and and you know they over there sharing

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,160
their disinformation on different facts

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,200
and stuff like that and and I would come

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,460
in

21
00:00:47,460 --> 00:00:51,000
and I'd be like yeah I'd hear it and I'd

22
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,140
give the actual factual

23
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,620
idea of what was what was going on you

24
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,000
know the stories they were sharing is

25
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,039
like all right listen

26
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:04,140
part of that is true but the other part

27
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:06,659
is wildly exaggerated let's this this is

28
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:08,340
the way it works this is how it happens

29
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:10,680
and you know what my supervisor looked

30
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:15,900
at me one day this was two days before I

31
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:20,479
left she looked at me and she said

32
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,400
she said can you can you tell me what's

33
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,460

34
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:29,220
random you know event in the news at the

35
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:31,020
time I think it was that Predator R

Kelly uh we were she was talking about

37
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:35,460
she wanted to know what went on with

38
00:01:35,460 --> 00:01:38,579
Gayle King and all that so you know I I

39
00:01:38,579 --> 00:01:39,180
um

40
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:42,119
I uh

41
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,060
just off rip told her the whole story of

42
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:48,060
it how how it all worked out what the

43
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:50,460
charges were with you know like all of

44
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:52,920
what the defenses could be would you

45
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,899
know like all that stuff who's involved

46
00:01:54,899 --> 00:01:57,780
and it just just you know

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,820
analyze the whole situation and broke it

48
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:02,460
down to you know she looked at me and

49
00:02:02,460 --> 00:02:03,780
she said

50
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,659
boy I think you missed your calling

51
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,639
because you ain't supposed to be here

52
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,120
that's what she said she was a

53
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,980
African-American lady boy I think you

54
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,140
missed your calling because you ain't

55
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:18,319
supposed to be here

56
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:20,700
and she just laughed at me right back to

57
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,780
work

58
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:23,520
and I sat there in the seat for the rest

59
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,660
of the day and I'm like

60
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,140
she's right

61
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:33,540
what am I doing here

62
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:37,080
if I know that my brain is what and I

63
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:38,520
always used to say this even before I

64
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,800
even got into trading and my brain was

65
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,900
worth millions of dollars

66
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:45,660
if I know that my brain is worth

67
00:02:45,660 --> 00:02:48,720
millions of dollars

68
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,940
what am I doing here

69
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:53,040
settling in this place

70
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,739
and this is why my job history I only

71
00:02:55,739 --> 00:02:57,780
you do about three four years and I'm

72
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:00,060
out you know it should have been less

73
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:02,640
than that I'll tell you that much but

74
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,980
I always said that my brain was worth

75
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:07,080
millions of dollars everywhere I went

76
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,239
people were always like yo you the

77
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:11,400
smartest dude I know or you know all of

78
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:13,920
this all of this Jazz maybe they're just

79
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,300
buttering me up because

80
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,620
I did

81
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:19,739
stuff for everybody you know but

82
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:21,599
um

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:23,340
you know she said that and I was like

84
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,519
she's absolutely correct

85
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,280
what am I doing here I

86
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:31,560
I know that my brain is worth more I

87
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,940
kept thinking to myself you know what

88
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:34,680
I'm gonna walk across the street to the

89
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,239
World Trade Center because I work in

90
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:38,220
downtown Manhattan I was like maybe I'll

91
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:39,780
just go to one of these Office Buildings

92
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,940

93
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:44,659

99
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,060
to be on my my uh uh cover letter

100
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:04,200
anytime I sent a cover letter I'll just

101
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,360
talked about being a fast learner

102
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:09,540
adapting to environments quickly and I

103
00:04:09,540 --> 00:04:12,540

106
00:04:18,839 --> 00:04:21,959
am in my ability to learn it that that's

107
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,060
what that was in my cover letter

108
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,680
um to most of your jobs I applied for

109
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:27,660
now most of the jobs I applied for of

110
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:30,720
course is word of mouth so obviously not

111
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,580
really

112
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,100
really good you need a resume or cover

113
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:37,020
letter for stuff like that well you you

114
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,880
know somebody and you get in like that

115
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,240
you know

116
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:43,680
a different story you know you skip the

117
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,000
line you know

118
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:46,979
but

119
00:04:46,979 --> 00:04:48,960
she said that to me and it really made

120
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,259
me think you know not too long after she

121
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,780
lost the worker yeah her best work at

122
00:04:54,780 --> 00:04:56,639
that you know but

123
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:59,280
but um

124
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,500
yeah I had to take pride in myself and

125
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:04,380
and my ability what I could do yes

126
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:05,820
when I live I didn't have no backup

127
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:08,880
option or anything like that but

128
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,120
for me I knew that

129
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:15,240
I was wasting away in that position

130
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,120
and it was becoming so irritable

131
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,360
to where even when I went home I wasn't

132
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,900
a pleasant person because I became so

133
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,000
uncomfortable

134
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:30,720
with the the salary was fine it was uh

135
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,800
uh 70 80 000 a year you know like for

136
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,440
for you know that stage in my life it

137
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:38,520
was fine

138
00:05:38,520 --> 00:05:40,800
you know but

139
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,960
I was uncomfortable

140
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,919
there was no more room to grow every

141
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:50,699
single job I've ever gotten I knew my

142
00:05:50,699 --> 00:05:52,740
work the next person's work the

143
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:55,320
supervisors work and the person above

144
00:05:55,320 --> 00:05:57,479
them

145
00:05:57,479 --> 00:05:59,639
so when my supervisor is coming to me to

146
00:05:59,639 --> 00:06:01,860
look over something

147
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:04,979
them telling me that that I'm wrong in

148
00:06:04,979 --> 00:06:06,479
something no we're not even gonna waste

149
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,520

00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,940
actually trying to absorb as much

189
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:41,039
information as I can

190
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,220
so I always insulated myself with every

191
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:47,000
single problem that I faced

192
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,919
rarely heard a mum out of me like you

193
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:50,940
know you you

194
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:52,919
couldn't

195
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:54,960
you didn't have anything to review or

196
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,060
check over or anything because it was

197
00:07:57,060 --> 00:07:58,440
all done

198
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:02,340
by the time it got to your desk

199
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,960
but then I realized that

200
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:09,000
no matter

201
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,620
how you know good of a worker I am I'm

202
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:16,139
still a worker

203
00:08:16,139 --> 00:08:17,819
and at any point where they start

204
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,740
passing down budget cuts guess who's

205
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,599
first

206
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,860
guess who's first

207
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,020
when they were

208
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:28,680
um

209
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:31,020
they were planning on furloughing a

210
00:08:31,020 --> 00:08:32,520
bunch of city workers during the

211
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:33,958
pandemic

212
00:08:33,958 --> 00:08:36,179
the first portion of the pandemic I I

213
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:38,279
was outside working

214
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:40,320
investigation still needed to happen I

215
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:41,580
was outside working

216
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:45,080
I dealt with child deaths

217
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,080
deaths d-e-a-t-h-s

218
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:55,019
having small kids and going around

219
00:08:55,019 --> 00:08:56,640
to

220
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,180
observe environments of kids who have

221
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:04,860
died at the hands of their caretakers

222
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:06,240
so that was another thing that was

223
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:07,920
making me uncomfortable

224
00:09:07,920 --> 00:09:09,540
having

225
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:13,260
my kids who I'm taking care of and then

226
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:16,380
showing up to the loss of other people's

227
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:19,200
children you know like it's it's not

228
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,700
gonna go too far into that you know

229
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:24,320
don't want it to be you know

230
00:09:24,680 --> 00:09:27,660
sad moment or anything but that that was

231
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:29,640
that was the paperwork I was filing

232
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,560
that's the stuff that I was going over

233
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:33,360
that's the the environment that I was

234
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,920
going in you know I'll tell you one

235
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,839
story the story of this woman that had a

236
00:09:36,839 --> 00:09:38,820
kid she didn't tell anybody where the

237
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,800
kid was she gave birth to the kid at

238
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:41,880
home

239
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:44,459
and then went to the hospital to go get

240
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:46,980
taken care of for recovery and they were

241
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:48,720
like hey this is consistent with signs

242
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:50,459
of you just going into labor where's the

243
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,019
kid she wouldn't tell anybody where the

244
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:55,620
kid was we go to her house

245
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,920
I opened up the the

246
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:03,480
the the uh little the little cabinets

247
00:10:03,480 --> 00:10:06,839
underneath the sink

248
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:11,220
and there's a dead newborn on top of

249
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:14,519
the the uh cleaning supplies and all

250
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:16,440
that other stuff

251
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:20,220
newborn died of starvation in there

252
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:24,060
you went to the hospital to take care of

253
00:10:24,060 --> 00:10:26,040
yourself

254
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:28,620
and left the kid underneath the

255
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:32,220
when the stone many other services the

256
00:10:32,220 --> 00:10:33,300
the

257
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,580
you could at least gave the kid up you

258
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:37,680
know something you know but

259
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,420
that's the type of stuff that I used to

260
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,540
I used to doing on so um

261
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,760
we all see I'm so direct with certain

262
00:10:44,760 --> 00:10:47,100
things play no games or certain things

263
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,560
you know just just

264
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,079
it's because the the work that I've

265
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:54,120
dealt with

266
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,600
it wasn't time to be theoretical

267
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,240
it was exact it was facts that's it

268
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:01,920
nothing else

269
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,899
that's it

270
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:06,839
so um uh

271
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:09,420
it was it was a lot a lot to deal with

272
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,060
you know so that was part of being

273
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:14,760
frustration at home and stuff too

274
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:15,899
um

275
00:11:15,899 --> 00:11:17,940
you know but when she said that to me it

276
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,740
really made me think and it made me

277
00:11:19,740 --> 00:11:23,160
reconsider what what or maybe even think

278
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:25,500
about what I was worth

279
00:11:25,500 --> 00:11:26,700
you know

280
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:28,620
where I placed

281
00:11:28,620 --> 00:11:31,860
worth Within Myself and um

282
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:35,279
uh on the other side of that

283
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,839
you know here's where I am like I said

284
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:38,220
during the pandemic they were

285
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:40,380
furloughing people they wouldn't pay

286
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,540
them

287
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,700
um for they still had to work still had

288
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:46,440
the requirement to work with they'd be

289
00:11:46,440 --> 00:11:50,040
fired but also was not getting paid

290
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:52,100
so they were getting ready to come down

291
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:55,380
and and cut a lot of the newer people

292
00:11:55,380 --> 00:11:57,839
who came in I was only about like three

293
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,540
years in but they were getting ready to

294
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:01,980
cut staff

295
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:03,420
and

296
00:12:03,420 --> 00:12:05,940
the second portion of that year

297
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:08,940
I had to think every day about

298
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,860
whether my job was going to be cut or

299
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:11,640
not

300
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:15,899
because I was one of the newer

301
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:17,480
uh

302
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:20,339
employees there I came in with a newer

303
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:21,180
class

304
00:12:21,180 --> 00:12:24,899
and our class was looking to get cut

305
00:12:24,899 --> 00:12:27,000
um you know so that that wasn't a great

306
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:27,980
feeling

307
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:30,839
2020 was a

308
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,959
year was just just insane that the last

309
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:36,300
day of the year I got hurt at work

310
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:44,279
last 2020 that was December 31st 2020.

311
00:12:45,540 --> 00:12:48,060
the last day of the year we we had to

312
00:12:48,060 --> 00:12:51,060
and we lose we lost Betty White you know

313
00:12:51,060 --> 00:12:53,579
all these different people that that got

314
00:12:53,579 --> 00:12:56,519
taken away from us and in those years

315
00:12:56,519 --> 00:13:00,480
you know it was it was just just an

316
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:02,279
insane thing

317
00:13:02,279 --> 00:13:03,420
um

318
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:06,000
to to deal with but I said that I'd

319
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:07,620
never ever

320
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:10,320
put the Power

321
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,540
of my kids being able to eat in somebody

322
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,980
else's hand

323
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:16,560
I will never ever do this so when people

324
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:18,839
ask about psychology for trading here's

325
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,519
the psychology

326
00:13:20,519 --> 00:13:24,060
you have no time to waste

327
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:27,839
every second that you give

328
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,779
to things that do not enhance or benefit

329
00:13:30,779 --> 00:13:35,040
your life you're taking away

330
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:38,279
from the time you have

331
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:40,139
to get this

332
00:13:40,139 --> 00:13:43,200
and you're digging yourself deeper

333
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:45,839
and deeper

334
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:50,700
into the hole you currently are in now

335
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,459
but you think nothing of it because it's

336
00:13:53,459 --> 00:13:55,980
not that deep once you become

337
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:57,839
uncomfortable

338
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,540
to the point where you can't even sleep

339
00:14:00,540 --> 00:14:02,040
at night

340
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:06,240
imagine having to study under that type

341
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,180
of atmosphere under that type of mental

342
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,680
capacity

343
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:13,079
so don't wait

344
00:14:13,079 --> 00:14:16,200
don't wait until it gets to that place

345
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:18,720
because I promise you it'll be ten times

346
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,480
harder to grasp this

347
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,040
I don't know who that's for that's a

348
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:24,360
wake-up call for somebody I don't know

349
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,339
who that's for that's what shadow

350
00:14:26,339 --> 00:14:28,800
somebody in the chat

351
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,320
needs to hear that

352
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:33,600
oh somebody in the chat and he said I

353
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,980
ain't a rapper though I ain't a rabbit

354
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:37,260
of somebody in the chat

355
00:14:37,260 --> 00:14:40,500
needs to hear that

356
00:14:40,500 --> 00:14:43,560
and get yourself together all right

357
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,440
that's my trait of psychology there you

358
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,420
already got the strategy that wins every

359
00:14:48,420 --> 00:14:49,220
day

360
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:53,399
it's here we show it we you already got

361
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:55,639
it

362
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,199
all right

363
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:00,540
amen

364
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,740
um

365
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:03,839
you see what I'm saying guys how I'm

366
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,180
expecting it to come about these eyes

367
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,500
here

368
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:08,060
um

369
00:15:08,060 --> 00:15:11,040
if it does

370
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:14,720
a drop I would expect it to

371
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:17,519
Rebound in here and then

372
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,779
trade back above here but I'm expecting

373
00:15:21,779 --> 00:15:24,779
these these highs to be taken out

374
00:15:24,779 --> 00:15:26,880
why particularly because we have this

375
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,620
low here

376
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,440
this here

377
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:34,860
traded down to this low and back up to

378
00:15:34,860 --> 00:15:39,360
the high that brought this here

379
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,420
so this is considered a weak High

380
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,360
this is the high that put in this low

381
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,579
and what we'd end up doing is taking out

382
00:15:47,579 --> 00:15:50,360
the both of them

383
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,660
um

384
00:15:58,220 --> 00:16:00,060
uh

385
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,579
can you rethink your opinion on your

386
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,680
opinion on one-on-one mentorship so what

387
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,440
what I'm considering doing uh for August

388
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,300
at least when I get back

389
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:11,579
is that um I'm probably gonna do a boot

390
00:16:11,579 --> 00:16:14,459
camp where I teach everything straight

391
00:16:14,459 --> 00:16:15,480
through

392
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:19,040
you know like from from Zero to Hero

393
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:22,199
from intro to Market structure

394
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:25,199
from uh Video One

395
00:16:25,199 --> 00:16:27,480
uh video two

396
00:16:27,480 --> 00:16:30,600
three four five and now six that

397
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:31,980
happened yesterday

398
00:16:31,980 --> 00:16:34,800
I'm gonna teach you straight through

399
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:36,600
and um

400
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,380
cream cream made that mix uh Josh cream

401
00:16:40,380 --> 00:16:42,779
that's with a k

402
00:16:42,779 --> 00:16:45,600
um I'm gonna teach all of that straight

403
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,600
through it's gonna go through like a two

404
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:50,279
or three day span

405
00:16:50,279 --> 00:16:52,259
and um

406
00:16:52,259 --> 00:16:55,920
one of the days is going to be a full

407
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,480
Market Day

408
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,600
a full Market Day

409
00:17:00,600 --> 00:17:01,980
so

410
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:05,939
um that that market day is it's probably

411
00:17:05,939 --> 00:17:07,319
going to be a New York session more than

412
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,660
likely but um

413
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,619
I'm going to show you

414
00:17:12,619 --> 00:17:17,040
every single entry that you can possibly

415
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,500
take

416
00:17:18,500 --> 00:17:21,839
every single entry that you can possibly

417
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,400
take whether it's a quick Scout whether

418
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,839
it's something you hold on to or there's

419
00:17:24,839 --> 00:17:26,880
something you add to as well you'll hear

420
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:29,460
that some of you add to as well multiple

421
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:32,340
pairs not just uh futures

422
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:35,400
you know those would be Forex added in

423
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,480
there I don't know if you want a little

424
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:39,600
bit of crypto whatever it is but all the

425
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,820
different entries that you can take that

426
00:17:41,820 --> 00:17:43,980
meets the criteria of what's in the

427
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,600
playlist

428
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,860
um

429
00:17:46,860 --> 00:17:49,500
you know I'm I'm gonna go through that

430
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,419
so I don't know whether it's going to be

431
00:17:51,419 --> 00:17:54,780
a Friday that I do it or whether it's a

432
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:57,600
Monday that I do it but um it's going to

433
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,419
be a three day span and the first

434
00:18:00,419 --> 00:18:03,179
portion is going to start with you know

435
00:18:03,179 --> 00:18:05,880
obviously the the Necessities the basic

436
00:18:05,880 --> 00:18:08,640
structure and end with candlestick

437
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:09,660
structure

438
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:11,700
then the following day is going to begin

439
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:14,160
again with candlestick structure but

440
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,700
then incorporate zones and then

441
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,440
um the third day is just gonna be

442
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,179
literally every single entry you can

443
00:18:21,179 --> 00:18:23,340
take with

444
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:24,600
you know

445
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:26,640
um with everything that's taught so I'm

446
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,740
going to do that sometime and um uh

447
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:33,240
uh

448
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:35,760
what did I say uh uh August due to

449
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,919
sometime in August give me a three-day

450
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:39,960
boot camp

451
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:42,360
but outside of that

452
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:43,320
um

453
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:45,720
you know I I don't want to get into

454
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,020
one-on-one mentoring because with

455
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:51,720
one-on-one mentoring people don't have

456
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:54,240
the same work ethic off-screen that they

457
00:18:54,240 --> 00:18:55,980
say they do on screen

458
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,539
so

459
00:18:57,539 --> 00:19:00,900
to be a mentor to you I need to be

460
00:19:00,900 --> 00:19:02,880
involved in your entire day I need to

461
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,860
know what your routine is I need to know

462
00:19:04,860 --> 00:19:07,200
where your mindset is and you know what

463
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:09,480
level of understanding you have I talk

464
00:19:09,480 --> 00:19:13,200
about for one-on-one I need to know that

465
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,360
I was trying to Mentor some of my

466
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:17,940
siblings until I saw that some of their

467
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:21,660
daily routines were entirely the

468
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,460
opposite of

469
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:27,380
what it took to become profitable

470
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:31,260
what it took to become profitable

471
00:19:31,260 --> 00:19:35,100
you know they're they're uh daily

472
00:19:35,100 --> 00:19:38,520
routines had a lot to do with

473
00:19:38,520 --> 00:19:40,620
knowing who was doing what watching

474
00:19:40,620 --> 00:19:43,740
videos on Instagram you know uh uh

475
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:46,280
watching the latest movie

476
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:50,039
chatting it up with friends and and you

477
00:19:50,039 --> 00:19:52,860
know sitting around drinking and all

478
00:19:52,860 --> 00:19:55,580
these different things

479
00:19:56,940 --> 00:19:58,740
rather than

480
00:19:58,740 --> 00:20:01,740
wanting to focus in on it exactly what I

481
00:20:01,740 --> 00:20:02,940
was teaching

482
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:04,799
exactly what I told him to go back and

483
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,960
do I'll tell you to go watch the video

484
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:10,080
and I'll say something about a video and

485
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:11,940
see what your response is

486
00:20:11,940 --> 00:20:15,900
tell me where it's at in the video

487
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:18,960
oh yeah I said this in video three tell

488
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,799
me where it's at

489
00:20:22,620 --> 00:20:26,700
tell me what video this was in

490
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:30,059
and and I'll start the sentence

491
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:31,740
and figure out if you if you know

492
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:34,500
exactly where it's going

493
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:36,480
yeah you remember that what video was

494
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:37,580
that

495
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:40,860
oh oh okay

496
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:43,020
now you stop giving me the responses

497
00:20:43,020 --> 00:20:44,280
that's just yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

498
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:45,480
yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

499
00:20:45,480 --> 00:20:48,120
yeah when I hear people doing that I

500
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:49,080
know that they don't know what the hell

501
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,500
they're talking about

502
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:57,419
me to death

503
00:20:57,419 --> 00:20:59,039
but if I told you show me it on the

504
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,059
chart you don't know what is that

505
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:05,340
can't do that that's a waste of time

506
00:21:05,340 --> 00:21:08,700
I'm literally trading the time from from

507
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:11,940
my family time to to reset my mental

508
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,880
health to give to you

509
00:21:14,880 --> 00:21:16,320
and

510
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,820
you

511
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:20,880
are taking that time for granted so it's

512
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:23,160
it's very very difficult for me to

513
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:25,559
commit to mentoring someone one-on-one

514
00:21:25,559 --> 00:21:28,020
knowing that people are not ready to

515
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,260
give up the lifestyle that that they

516
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,880
currently have

517
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,580
give up the nothingness that they're

518
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,159
they're doing now

519
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:39,919
the

520
00:21:39,919 --> 00:21:43,500
nothingness that they're doing now their

521
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:46,020
Pleasures their comforts

522
00:21:46,020 --> 00:21:47,940
you want to be a mechanic why are you

523
00:21:47,940 --> 00:21:49,980
not watching all the all the videos on

524
00:21:49,980 --> 00:21:51,780
Mechanic hacks

525
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:53,159
well you're not watching all the videos

526
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:55,320
about about

527
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,919
cars you ain't never worked on yet

528
00:21:58,919 --> 00:22:01,140
or how to solve you know whatever it is

529
00:22:01,140 --> 00:22:03,179
quick tips on on this and that while

530
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:04,440
you're not watching videos about that

531
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:05,700
huh

532
00:22:05,700 --> 00:22:07,080
would you want would you want to be

533
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:08,039
mechanic

534
00:22:08,039 --> 00:22:09,780
you want somebody to trust you trust you

535
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:11,400
touching that call

536
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:13,260
you want somebody trust you touching

537
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:15,679
that car

538
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:18,840
and

539
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:22,460
you that's your work ethic oh

540
00:22:22,460 --> 00:22:26,520
okay okay yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah okay

541
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:28,140
that's what I mean yeah yeah yeah right

542
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:29,400
out the door you ain't never gonna see

543
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:31,700
me again

544
00:22:39,419 --> 00:22:42,559
whatever it takes

545
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:47,640
whatever it takes

546
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,760
whatever

547
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,039
it

548
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:56,039
takes

549
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,360
so so I I can't commit to doing that

550
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:05,400
knowing that people are not ready to do

551
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,740
whatever

552
00:23:07,740 --> 00:23:09,960
it

553
00:23:09,960 --> 00:23:12,679
takes

554
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:16,380
because I know that I'm willing

555
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:18,960
to do whatever is necessary to make sure

556
00:23:18,960 --> 00:23:21,600
you get this but there needs to be a

557
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,600
reciprocity there

558
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:26,100
you understand it needs to be a

559
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:29,179
reciprocity there

560
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,220
you know and that was just an experience

561
00:23:32,220 --> 00:23:34,080
that I had with my siblings

562
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,900
and and I was teaching for a whole year

563
00:23:36,900 --> 00:23:40,260
I was doing 16 18 hours in the Discord

564
00:23:40,260 --> 00:23:43,140
I was teaching all the way into 1am and

565
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:44,940
would get back up at six and start

566
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:46,620
streaming

567
00:23:46,620 --> 00:23:48,960
and then back into teaching throughout

568
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:52,020
the whole day after after the market

569
00:23:52,020 --> 00:23:53,820

571
00:23:55,020 --> 00:23:57,299

teaching from Sydney Market open all the

573
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:05,100
way into London

574
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:10,140

575
00:24:10,140 --> 00:24:12,419

thank you

579
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:24,900

580
00:24:24,900 --> 00:24:26,400
but you're going after work economical

581
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:28,260
form

582
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:32,000
so so I had to scale back

583
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:36,000
scale back yes work ethic is not

584
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:39,539
something you you could teach people yes

585
00:24:39,539 --> 00:24:42,780
it has to be inside yes innate

586
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:44,940
Kobe said

587
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:46,380
if

588
00:24:46,380 --> 00:24:49,740
he did if most of his competitors are

589
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:52,260
doing two workouts a day but he was able

590
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,700
to do four

591
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:57,360
and he was able to split it up between

592
00:24:57,360 --> 00:24:59,520
certain times and still be able to get

593
00:24:59,520 --> 00:25:01,080
family time in and all that other stuff

594
00:25:01,080 --> 00:25:04,980
he said before you know it you will be a

595
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:09,000
light years ahead

596
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:13,140
you will be light years ahead

597
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:15,799
of your competitors

598
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:18,480
light years

599
00:25:18,480 --> 00:25:21,440

619
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:32,880
I when I talk about my work ethic and

620
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:35,400
and what what I see and what I'm willing

621
00:26:35,400 --> 00:26:37,500

I I just need people to

626
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:48,200

628
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:58,380
and learn that for yourself for free

629
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:00,480

matters about

633
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:09,659
you know your willpower

634
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:12,840

00:27:14,279 --> 00:27:16,080
good at how long did it take you to get

637
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:19,500
good at it probably wasn't it wasn't 15

638
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,860
minutes

639
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:25,700
I know it wasn't 15 minutes

640
00:27:26,159 --> 00:27:27,659
so you want to go to if you want to get

641
00:27:27,659 --> 00:27:28,679
good at something that's supposed to

642
00:27:28,679 --> 00:27:29,940
take care of you for the rest of your

643
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:31,080
life

644
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:35,000
it's not going to be 15 minutes

645
00:27:35,220 --> 00:27:37,080
I promise you it's not gonna be 15

646
00:27:37,080 --> 00:27:39,440
minutes

647
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:41,760
you didn't learn that in 15 minutes but

648
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:44,000
you want to learn this in 15 minutes

649
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:46,500
you learned that in a five minute video

650
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,640
but you wanna learn this in a five

651
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:50,000
minute video

652
00:27:54,299 --> 00:27:55,880
man oh man

653
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,900
I don't even think it took you five

654
00:27:57,900 --> 00:28:00,179
minutes to walk

655
00:28:00,179 --> 00:28:01,799
you took your first steps and then what

656
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:03,120
fail

657
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,220
you took more stuff and fail you took

658
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,779
more steps get and failed over the

659
00:28:06,779 --> 00:28:08,580
course how many how long

660
00:28:08,580 --> 00:28:09,900
oh

661
00:28:09,900 --> 00:28:12,779
but you want to learn

662
00:28:12,779 --> 00:28:15,900
something life-changing in 15 minutes

663
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,760
okay

664
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,419
got you

665
00:28:21,779 --> 00:28:24,440
heard you

666
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,559
so um

667
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:40,140
now I'm putting some music behind it

668
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:42,000
because I feel like that needed to be

669
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:45,120
said to a lot of the crowd this here and

670
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,500
anybody that's going to come back and

671
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:49,260
listen to this video

672
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:51,900
I wanted to get that out the way

673
00:28:51,900 --> 00:28:55,559
um somebody asked hi Dave actually they

674
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,539
accidentally two different accounts but

675
00:28:57,539 --> 00:28:59,640
the same question but

676
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,260
hi Dave I have a question regarding

677
00:29:01,260 --> 00:29:03,480
funded accounts so you risk two percent

678
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:05,640
of the trailing threshold fifty dollars

679
00:29:05,640 --> 00:29:08,340
of drawdown is 2500 I don't know how

680
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:09,779
much you should risk and I'd never tell

681
00:29:09,779 --> 00:29:11,039
you how much you should risk because

682
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,080
risk in this market is inevitable and

683
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,720
whatever you risk you can lose the

684
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:20,039
entire thing

685
00:29:20,039 --> 00:29:22,679
and in order to

686
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:24,899
receive any advice on risk that means

687
00:29:24,899 --> 00:29:26,700
that you need to receive financial

688
00:29:26,700 --> 00:29:29,279

will ever be Financial advice this is

696
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,700
just my personal perspective on the

697
00:29:47,700 --> 00:29:49,500
market that's right every day by the way

698
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:52,200
and you need to

699
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,659
seek out a financial advisor

700
00:29:54,659 --> 00:29:57,179
if you're looking for financial advice

701
00:29:57,179 --> 00:29:59,640
on what to risk

702
00:29:59,640 --> 00:30:03,020
in these markets

703
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,940
let me see do that miss anything

704
00:30:18,179 --> 00:30:21,059
because you are not going to sue me

705
00:30:21,059 --> 00:30:24,600
he said to do this and then and then I

706
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,659
did it and and then I lost everything

707
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:29,220
y'all know younger two people for that

708
00:30:29,220 --> 00:30:32,279
right anybody give you a signal

709
00:30:32,279 --> 00:30:34,919
and and they don't go the way it's

710
00:30:34,919 --> 00:30:36,240
supposed to go and you lose money you

711
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:39,740
can sue them back part y'all know that

712
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,380
you can sue them back for it

713
00:30:43,380 --> 00:30:45,480
shoot them for the money that they they

714
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,580
made you lose

715
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,679
because they gave you that the direction

716
00:30:49,679 --> 00:30:53,940
now when I'm trading my

717
00:30:53,940 --> 00:30:57,140
funders accounts

718
00:30:57,179 --> 00:31:00,440
I am risking

719
00:31:01,140 --> 00:31:02,940
a percentage

720
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:06,299
of the drawdown that I'm allowed

721
00:31:06,299 --> 00:31:08,640
so if I have a 100K account and I'm

722
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,580
allowed 2500 or maybe it's maybe it's

723
00:31:11,580 --> 00:31:13,559
like four thousands

724
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:16,559
drawdown

725
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:19,260
or eight or ten I don't know what a lot

726
00:31:19,260 --> 00:31:21,360
of these other companies have but um if

727
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:23,520
I'm allowed four percent

728
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:26,340
and I'm risking

729
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:29,820
one percent per trade on a 100K account

730
00:31:29,820 --> 00:31:31,260
that means that I'm risking a thousand

731
00:31:31,260 --> 00:31:34,100
dollars per trade

732
00:31:34,679 --> 00:31:38,360
so that means I only have four trades

733
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:41,580
and I have to be right on at least one

734
00:31:41,580 --> 00:31:43,860
of them and at least make that one

735
00:31:43,860 --> 00:31:45,419
percent or

736
00:31:45,419 --> 00:31:48,299
you know higher

737
00:31:48,299 --> 00:31:51,140
so um

738
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,460
I wouldn't be risking the balance of the

739
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:57,419
account I would be risking the

740
00:31:57,419 --> 00:31:59,520
drawdown that I'm allowed so if I'm

741
00:31:59,520 --> 00:32:02,940
allowed only 4 000 in drawdown

742
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:05,580
then I'd be risking a percentage of

743
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:08,220
whatever I'm allowed and draw down

744
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:11,039
not

745
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:14,640
what I'm allowed for the size of the

746
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,600
account

747
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:18,480
now for me personally

748
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:21,899
I'm risking a lot more than y'all are

749
00:32:21,899 --> 00:32:23,820
because

750
00:32:23,820 --> 00:32:25,740
in a lot of these areas that I'm trading

751
00:32:25,740 --> 00:32:26,700
from

752
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:30,000
you see that there's an exact tap and we

753
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,539
shift away you get the tap and we added

754
00:32:33,539 --> 00:32:34,380
it

755
00:32:34,380 --> 00:32:36,659
So within a couple points over then a

756
00:32:36,659 --> 00:32:39,840
couple Pips or or whatever it is

757
00:32:39,840 --> 00:32:41,580
um certainly

758
00:32:41,580 --> 00:32:44,100
you know expecting a quick top in there

759
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:46,700
and then we out of there

760
00:32:46,700 --> 00:32:49,559
and if I lose on that then then I lose

761
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:53,460
that and I wait for the next thing so

762
00:32:53,460 --> 00:32:55,200
I certainly

763
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:55,980
um

764
00:32:55,980 --> 00:32:58,320
have different metrics into what I'm

765
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:00,000
willing to risk based on what experience

766
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,919
I have

767
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:04,440
but for for you

768
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:06,960
um you see a lot of financial advisor

769
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,880
and they'll let you know

770
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,159
um what percentage is okay for you to

771
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:13,019
risk in the markets but whatever it is

772
00:33:13,019 --> 00:33:16,019
that you do risk make sure your risk is

773
00:33:16,019 --> 00:33:18,299
always behind

774
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:20,279
a zone that you're trading from that's

775
00:33:20,279 --> 00:33:22,019
what I teach in the playlist it has not

776
00:33:22,019 --> 00:33:24,419
changed it's not ever going to change I

777
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,360
will never ever change what I say

778
00:33:26,360 --> 00:33:29,220
whatever if you watch my playlist if you

779
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,799
join mentorship whatever it is I think

780
00:33:30,799 --> 00:33:33,840
zekeg you you have joined a mentorship

781
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,880
previously

782
00:33:35,880 --> 00:33:37,380
um you've been around for quite some

783
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,240
time as well

784
00:33:39,240 --> 00:33:42,120
the question that you ask is like a

785
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:44,940
Elementary question um like a first

786
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,080
grade question in terms of

787
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,240
what it is that you're risking I've been

788
00:33:51,240 --> 00:33:54,659
saying that for a almost a year yeah and

789
00:33:54,659 --> 00:33:57,240
some change and I'll never stop saying

790
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:59,760
that you're risking

791
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:01,440
whatever whatever it is that you are

792
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,480
risking it's behind the zone that you're

793
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,820
trading from that's it it's nothing else

794
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,339
if price trades below that zone it

795
00:34:08,339 --> 00:34:10,800
invalidated your trade and and you're

796
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:11,699
out

797
00:34:11,699 --> 00:34:14,639
but whatever it is you're risking so if

798
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:16,199
the Zone if you're getting it at the 50

799
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:20,280
of the zone and you're risking the other

800
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:22,639
50 portion of the Zone guess what

801
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:25,320
whatever you have in your account

802
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:27,719
followed by whatever amount of Trades

803
00:34:27,719 --> 00:34:29,460
you want to be able to take to survive

804
00:34:29,460 --> 00:34:32,040
in this game goes behind that account

805
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,260
and nothing else

806
00:34:34,260 --> 00:34:38,639
if it goes below that that uh structure

807
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,679
you're out

808
00:34:40,679 --> 00:34:43,619
your trade is out your trade is gone

809
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,080
whether you lose whether you were right

810
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:48,000
about the direction but you were wrong

811
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:51,899
about the entry you're out

812
00:34:51,899 --> 00:34:54,179
I follow the same things too I'll close

813
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:55,619
the trade as soon as it goes below the

814
00:34:55,619 --> 00:34:57,420
zone and invalidated my trade I got into

815
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:59,520
a poor entry I need to find a better

816
00:34:59,520 --> 00:35:02,040
entry next time that's the way that I

817
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,720
trade that's the only way that I would

818
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,580
encourage somebody to trade you don't

819
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:08,880
hold on and hope that it comes back

820
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,859
no

821
00:35:10,859 --> 00:35:14,339
so whatever it is that that you're able

822
00:35:14,339 --> 00:35:17,520
to risk you need to understand that it

823
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:21,060
needs to be behind the zone

824
00:35:21,060 --> 00:35:23,700
that you are trading from

825
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:28,079
needs to be behind the zone that you are

826
00:35:28,079 --> 00:35:30,540
trading from

827
00:35:30,540 --> 00:35:32,880
so I'll never tell you you know what

828
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:34,980
amount you should risk what you know

829
00:35:34,980 --> 00:35:37,500
never confirm or deny anything like that

830
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,660
I'm just saying that that's that's what

831
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,640
I've taught if you ever watch my

832
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:43,380
playlist if you ever

833
00:35:43,380 --> 00:35:45,599
you know studied under me you know that

834
00:35:45,599 --> 00:35:47,700
I've been preaching that same thing for

835
00:35:47,700 --> 00:35:50,040
God knows how long and I'm gonna

836
00:35:50,040 --> 00:35:52,980
continue to preach that same thing

837
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:55,740
because that's how you remain profitable

838
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:58,560
I told you guys yesterday

839
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:01,619
in order to continue playing at the

840
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:03,300
arcade in the pizza shop that I was

841
00:36:03,300 --> 00:36:05,099
playing those video games at one I

842
00:36:05,099 --> 00:36:07,200
needed to know how to play the game

843
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:09,780
I'm gonna be wasting my Quarters on on

844
00:36:09,780 --> 00:36:11,940
you know already fighting fighting with

845
00:36:11,940 --> 00:36:13,920
my sister about stealing it off my dress

846
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:16,020
up but you know I'm not wasting my

847
00:36:16,020 --> 00:36:18,500
quarters

848
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:21,300
so I'm gonna know I need to know how to

849
00:36:21,300 --> 00:36:24,140
play the game first

850
00:36:24,480 --> 00:36:26,339
but in the event that I lose I need to

851
00:36:26,339 --> 00:36:31,440
be able to play the game again right

852
00:36:32,220 --> 00:36:34,680
so if you have that

853
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,839
in the Forefront of your mind

854
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,820
then your wrist needs to be calculated

855
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:41,579
with the amount of times

856
00:36:41,579 --> 00:36:42,960
that you want to be able to play the

857
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,339
game if you want to play the game once

858
00:36:44,339 --> 00:36:48,060
over leverage and blow your account

859
00:36:48,060 --> 00:36:49,260
you want to be able to play the game

860
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:51,859
multiple times

861
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:54,680
then

862
00:36:58,260 --> 00:37:00,540
basic elementary math is required that's

863
00:37:00,540 --> 00:37:04,220
it basic elementary elementary

864
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:07,200
math is required

865
00:37:07,200 --> 00:37:08,940
that's it

866
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,500
I lost a lot of money when I first

867
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:12,300
started options trading too I lost

868
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:14,400
eighteen thousand dollars when I first

869
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:16,079
started options trading I wasn't even

870
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:17,640
like I didn't know what a chart looked

871
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:19,020
like I didn't know what candlesticksburg

872
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,700
nothing I was just trading based on the

873
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:23,040
Greeks and

874
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:24,599
I lost a lot of money I ain't going back

875
00:37:24,599 --> 00:37:26,099
to suit him I was foolish for even

876
00:37:26,099 --> 00:37:28,020
following that eighteen thousand dollars

877
00:37:28,020 --> 00:37:31,760
later I was foolish

878
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:36,540
I was foolish this man was foolish for

879
00:37:36,540 --> 00:37:38,880
following that yeah

880
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:41,880
so I don't blame them that's my tuition

881
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:43,920
you know shame that's my intuition you

882
00:37:43,920 --> 00:37:45,060
know

883
00:37:45,060 --> 00:37:48,180
it happens to the best of us

884
00:37:48,180 --> 00:37:50,220
you know but uh

885
00:37:50,220 --> 00:37:52,859
make sure that now trail with better

886
00:37:52,859 --> 00:37:56,119
risk better understand it

887
00:37:56,579 --> 00:37:58,380
I know

888
00:37:58,380 --> 00:38:01,339
that um

889
00:38:01,619 --> 00:38:05,339
that has helped me to

890
00:38:05,339 --> 00:38:07,500
live to live again

891
00:38:07,500 --> 00:38:10,079
live to live again

892
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:14,780
if it does make it make sense

893
00:38:20,579 --> 00:38:24,000
very foolish

894
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:25,859

you don't that's it exactly I can't

00:38:44,520 --> 00:38:45,780
teach that that's what I keep telling

903
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,579
people I can't give you psychology maybe

904
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:50,339
you need to go speak to a therapist or

905
00:38:50,339 --> 00:38:51,720
whatever it is maybe you need to look

906
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:54,420
within go to that mirror and be like for

907
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,920
me I used to get up and I used to be

908
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,079
like you are somebody I used to look

909
00:38:58,079 --> 00:38:59,940
into the mirror like you you are

910
00:38:59,940 --> 00:39:01,440
somebody you are great

911
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:03,359
you do have purpose

912
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,339
you are going to be successful you will

913
00:39:05,339 --> 00:39:09,920
make it in life you are not a a

914
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,500
you you are not your past you're not

915
00:39:13,500 --> 00:39:15,540
your past decisions

916
00:39:15,540 --> 00:39:17,579
you made these decisions in error and

917
00:39:17,579 --> 00:39:19,320
out of ignorance and even if it wasn't

918
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,880
ignorance even if you knew the

919
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,859
consequences of it you made these

920
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:27,000
decisions but you are not your decisions

921
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,460
you you suffer in the consequences of it

922
00:39:29,460 --> 00:39:30,900
now yes

923
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:33,660
because you reap what you sow exactly

924
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:37,020
but you are not your decisions

925
00:39:37,020 --> 00:39:41,820
you you are better than what you've done

926
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:44,700
there's there's this hope

927
00:39:44,700 --> 00:39:47,640
as long as the breath is in your body

928
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:49,800
this hope

929
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,140
you know that that's what I had to tell

930
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:54,380
myself

931
00:39:54,420 --> 00:39:56,700
no matter what you did no matter nobody

932
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,740
can't hold your past decisions over your

933
00:39:58,740 --> 00:40:00,780
head the shame and guilt that comes from

934
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:03,960
it I was married less than less days

935
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,180
than Kim Kardashian

936
00:40:06,180 --> 00:40:09,060
I might have Beats world record if

937
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,260
that's the case

938
00:40:10,260 --> 00:40:13,079
but you are not the the poor decisions

939
00:40:13,079 --> 00:40:15,420
you made that doesn't Define your life

940
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:18,000
doesn't Define your future you're better

941
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:19,260
than that you can come out of this

942
00:40:19,260 --> 00:40:21,540
you're gonna rise out of them ashes

943
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:24,599
that's what I tell myself in the mirror

944
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:29,119
speak that to myself every single day

945
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,560
just because you're having a bad day

946
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:33,359
doesn't mean you have a bad life

947
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,579
you you ate today

948
00:40:35,579 --> 00:40:38,180
yeah

949
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:43,980
you woke up you can't put an alarm clock

950
00:40:43,980 --> 00:40:46,800
in a graveyard and watch them get up

951
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:48,839
if they do then boy we at the end of the

952
00:40:48,839 --> 00:40:51,780
world we in the last days but you can't

953
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:54,480
you can't put an alarm clock in the crib

954
00:40:54,480 --> 00:40:56,760
the Breath You Take now somebody's

955
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,380
taking the last one

956
00:40:58,380 --> 00:41:00,240
well you taking this one that you take

957
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:01,619
it for granted

958
00:41:01,619 --> 00:41:03,720
it's been taking the last one

959
00:41:03,720 --> 00:41:08,240
you still here you will not die before

960
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:11,720
fulfilling your purpose you're not

961
00:41:11,720 --> 00:41:16,500
allowed to die until you reach your

962
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,660
destination until you reach your purpose

963
00:41:18,660 --> 00:41:21,480
until you reach the place

964
00:41:21,480 --> 00:41:24,060
that God called you to go to

965
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:26,640
you're not even allowed to die

966
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:28,320
that's what I tell myself every day in

967
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:29,880
the mirror just to just to work myself

968
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:32,520
out up out of that funk just to get

969
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:34,680
myself out of whatever it is that I was

970
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:36,240
feeling

971
00:41:36,240 --> 00:41:39,180
and it doesn't mean that that I felt

972
00:41:39,180 --> 00:41:41,460
better that day

973
00:41:41,460 --> 00:41:43,619
or I felt better the next day maybe I

974
00:41:43,619 --> 00:41:44,940
didn't even feel better the next week

975
00:41:44,940 --> 00:41:48,320
but guess what baby

976
00:41:48,320 --> 00:41:51,359
guess what

977
00:41:51,359 --> 00:41:55,200
look away man now

978
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:59,339
look at how things changed

979
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:02,640
and every every new level you get to yes

980
00:42:02,640 --> 00:42:05,820
there's a new Devil at that new level

981
00:42:05,820 --> 00:42:07,560
ain't a rapper though there's a new

982
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:08,700
level

983
00:42:08,700 --> 00:42:11,339
the new Devil at that new level

984
00:42:11,339 --> 00:42:12,780
yes

985
00:42:12,780 --> 00:42:14,520
going to deal with issues at that new

986
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:17,180
level too

987
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,619
it means throwing a child each time you

988
00:42:19,619 --> 00:42:22,740
you deal with those issues

989
00:42:22,740 --> 00:42:26,040

990
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,960
I know some of y'all understand I know

some of y'all feel it

992
00:42:30,180 --> 00:42:31,920
maybe they should be the trading

00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:33,839
psychology video I don't know maybe I

994
00:42:33,839 --> 00:42:35,160

00:44:39,300 --> 00:44:42,240
saying that but you know you

1046
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:45,660
whatever did you make an hour

1047
00:44:45,660 --> 00:44:47,480
if you made it in a couple of minutes

1048
00:44:47,480 --> 00:44:49,920
consider that

1049
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:53,900
where you where you place your stop

1050
00:44:54,180 --> 00:44:56,160
you're taking out be grateful that it

1051
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:58,079
was more than what you made in an hour

1052
00:44:58,079 --> 00:44:59,520
just within a couple minutes you're

1053
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,960
gonna find a couple more entries

1054
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:06,480
you you're gonna be able to to work your

1055
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:09,800
way through it creatively

1056
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,300
but the first step when it comes to

1057
00:45:12,300 --> 00:45:13,440
Trading

1058
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:15,540
I always tell people it's Capital

1059
00:45:15,540 --> 00:45:17,940
preservation

1060
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:19,920
Capital preservation

1061
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,900
most of the entries that I give you guys

1062
00:45:21,900 --> 00:45:24,060
well I don't give you guys entries most

1063
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:27,660
of the entries that I'm teaching with

1064
00:45:27,660 --> 00:45:30,300
they instantly go into profit and allow

1065
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:31,980
you to be able to

1066
00:45:31,980 --> 00:45:35,819
to uh manage quickly

1067
00:45:35,819 --> 00:45:37,680
within that they allow you to be able to

1068
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:40,339
manage quickly

1069
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:41,819
and

1070
00:45:41,819 --> 00:45:44,700
the rest is on you

1071
00:45:44,700 --> 00:45:46,319
because you're going to be overtaken by

1072
00:45:46,319 --> 00:45:48,180
greed

1073
00:45:48,180 --> 00:45:51,359
or you're gonna be overtaken by fear

1074
00:45:51,359 --> 00:45:52,980
at both of those things could cause you

1075
00:45:52,980 --> 00:45:54,660
to lose

1076
00:45:54,660 --> 00:45:56,280
even if you know where the market is

1077
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:58,520
going

1078
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:00,780
so

1079
00:46:00,780 --> 00:46:04,560
that's that's my trading psychology for

1080
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,599
for me

1081
00:46:06,599 --> 00:46:08,460
and if

1082
00:46:08,460 --> 00:46:11,599
the shoe fit

1083
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:16,700
Leicester stitch up

1084
00:46:16,859 --> 00:46:18,740
you know like the

1085
00:46:18,740 --> 00:46:23,119
laces usually stitched together

1086
00:46:26,359 --> 00:46:30,060
you shoot fit baby

1087
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:32,280
lace that stitch up

1088
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,319

1099
00:46:53,220 --> 00:46:56,160
happened for him it finally broke it

1100
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:59,880
finally shifted for other people that

1101
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:02,460
are here that are learning the concepts

1102
00:47:02,460 --> 00:47:04,859
that I'm teaching what I want you guys

1103
00:47:04,859 --> 00:47:08,940
to understand is consider this a bag of

1104
00:47:08,940 --> 00:47:10,859
popcorn right

1105
00:47:10,859 --> 00:47:14,280
consider this a bag of popcorn

1106
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,859
Charles already popped

1107
00:47:16,859 --> 00:47:18,420

1111
00:47:26,339 --> 00:47:29,400

00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:32,460
popped ready for him bird it popped

1113
00:47:32,460 --> 00:47:36,359
ready for him we all in the same bag

1114
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,819
we all apply in the same kind of

1115
00:47:38,819 --> 00:47:40,079
pressure

1116
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:42,300
but just because one pop doesn't mean

1117
00:47:42,300 --> 00:47:44,040
the the

1118
00:47:44,040 --> 00:47:46,319
everything else is just going pop all at

1119
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:49,440
the same time no we you know let the

1120
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:52,800
heat get to you apply the pressure

1121
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,839

here

1193
00:51:32,819 --> 00:51:36,680

1194
00:51:36,839 --> 00:51:38,339
people in the group they're short when

1195
00:51:38,339 --> 00:51:40,980
we long while you shorten if we long

00:51:47,700 --> 00:51:49,680
with you

1200
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:52,500

1201
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:55,319
be able to do this yourself

1202
00:51:55,319 --> 00:51:56,819

00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,980
for yourself you need to be able to open

1212
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,300

00:56:29,700 --> 00:56:31,920

1310
00:56:45,420 --> 00:56:46,800
here asking questions that's already

1311
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:47,880
there

1312
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:50,819
why are you wasting your money that way

1313
00:56:50,819 --> 00:56:53,040
why would you wait until you've actually

1314
00:56:53,040 --> 00:56:55,079
grasped everything and you want to go

1315
00:56:55,079 --> 00:56:56,940
deeper into what you already know why

1316
00:56:56,940 --> 00:56:58,200
would you waste your money that way it

1317
00:56:58,200 --> 00:57:00,420
makes no sense

1318
00:57:00,420 --> 00:57:02,160
you you see what my one-on-ones look

1319
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:03,960
like you see where the price is for the

1320
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:06,660
one-on-one you don't ever need that 101

1321
00:57:06,660 --> 00:57:09,119
you don't ever need a one-on-one for me

1322
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:10,800
one-on-one for me is with that playlist

1323
00:57:10,800 --> 00:57:12,599
you and that playlist that's one-on-one

1324
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:15,660
you and that playlist that's one-on-one

1325
00:57:15,660 --> 00:57:18,900
because any question that you have I

1326
00:57:18,900 --> 00:57:20,819
promise you it's answered in that

1327
00:57:20,819 --> 00:57:22,339
playlist

1328
00:57:22,339 --> 00:57:25,160
and any

1329
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,140
question that you have somebody's like

1330
00:57:28,140 --> 00:57:31,260
what what's those boxes

1331
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:34,619
you wasted your time partner it's in

1332
00:57:34,619 --> 00:57:37,160
that playlist

1333
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:40,920
in that so what so so what is what is a

1334
00:57:40,920 --> 00:57:44,240
break of structure to you

1335
00:57:46,260 --> 00:57:49,619
is in

1336
00:57:49,619 --> 00:57:53,819
that playlist should we should we use a

1337
00:57:53,819 --> 00:57:57,740
body or should we use the wick

1338
00:58:02,940 --> 00:58:05,880
so so do we do do we wait for it to come

1339
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:08,400
to the 50 of the imbalance

1340
00:58:08,400 --> 00:58:10,559
so what what does the confirmation look

1341
00:58:10,559 --> 00:58:12,740
like

1342
00:58:13,380 --> 00:58:16,260
so you you pay money to join and then

1343
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:18,000
you ask something that you ain't even

1344
00:58:18,000 --> 00:58:20,900
have to pay money to

1345
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,599

1346

1347

1348
00:59:21,330 --> 00:59:53,760
[Music]

1349
00:59:53,760 --> 00:59:55,559
the other thing that I tell people to do

1350
00:59:55,559 --> 00:59:58,799
is that

1351
00:59:58,799 --> 01:00:01,380
um any entries that you want to take any

1352
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:02,880
entries that you have any issues with

1353
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:04,680
whatever it is make sure you print it

1354
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:06,299
out and take it with you print it out

1355
01:00:06,299 --> 01:00:09,180
put it in your wallet put it in your bag

1356
01:00:09,180 --> 01:00:12,480
tape it on your walls go to bed at night

1357
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:15,119
always look for a trade before you go to

1358
01:00:15,119 --> 01:00:16,920
bed look on the 15 minute time frame

1359
01:00:16,920 --> 01:00:18,359
forecast something that's gonna happen

1360
01:00:18,359 --> 01:00:20,400
wake up in the morning make sure you see

1361
01:00:20,400 --> 01:00:23,220
what happened if you get it wrong you

1362
01:00:23,220 --> 01:00:25,920
also learn every day that you get up why

1363
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:27,359
you got that entry wrong the night

1364
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:29,160
