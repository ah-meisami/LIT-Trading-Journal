1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:04,560
all right so look at this right here

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:07,800
um look at this right

3
00:00:07,800 --> 00:00:10,880
here this Candlestick pattern that we

4
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,040
always talk about look we came back into

5
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:16,560
this area this is the snd responsible

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,359
for the break above but what do we have

7
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:21,720
inside of here we have an

8
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:26,800
imbalance so that's where we got to tap

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
same thing

10
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,800
here

11
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,960
imbalance we get this TA down we come

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:36,960
into this area here because this is the

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,200
area where we flipped pushed up to here

14
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:43,559
came back down to this area and then

15
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:45,399
ended up taking it

16
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,399
above

17
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:53,359
so imbalance to Zone to look this

18
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:55,559
Candlestick formation that we talked

19
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:58,239
about happened on the downside here look

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:01,800
at it happening up here

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,399
but this could just be coming down to

22
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:05,640
this Wick and then pushing up or this

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:07,520
could be trading lower to the actual

24
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,880
sndd here that's responsible for this

25
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,400
break so let's see are we touching

26
00:01:21,400 --> 00:01:23,680
here don't worry I'll do the top down in

27
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,600
a few guys

28
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:28,200
um want some other people to come in oh

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,560
my coffee that's right ch you right my

30
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,600
coffee I think that's what happens I

31
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:36,200
think I got to get up and have coffee

32
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,200
earlier that could be

33
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,640
it sorry about that guys

34
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:49,320
um I can't hear the music on my end but

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,799
you're good oh that's because I turned

36
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,719
it down here let me bring it back up

37
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:57,439
some

38
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,840
yeah should be able to hear it now

39
00:02:02,200 --> 00:02:03,960
slim you crazy for that I think I was

40
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,119
muted when I laughed at

41
00:02:07,239 --> 00:02:10,038
that yeah yeah remember we learned 30

42
00:02:10,038 --> 00:02:12,239
times faster on the one

43
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:14,400
minute so look this could be coming up

44
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,000
into this area and rejecting

45
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,599
out we could potentially have this type

46
00:02:20,599 --> 00:02:24,840
of rejection out of

47
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,200
here before actually leaving or maybe we

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:30,840
tapped into this snd here that gave us a

49
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:32,760
strong enough push up but it didn't tap

50
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:34,160
into the middle so I'm still a little

51
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:36,640
wary of

52
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:41,960
[Music]

53
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:49,159
it come on people where are those likes

54
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:52,680
that's funny no um I guess the emphasis

55
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,640
on liking and sharing and all that other

56
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,480
stuff is is High um for any YouTuber

57
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,120
really um but I'm not really looking to

58
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,640
get paid from YouTube um and monetize on

59
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:06,519
YouTube views it's more money in Forex

60
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:08,360
than there is in

61
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,879
YouTube so um people like it people

62
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:13,680
don't have to whatever it doesn't matter

63
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,000
to me

64
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,159
um this could be running this High yeah

65
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:21,720
and coming back down into here maybe

66
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,080
feel the imbalance maybe

67
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,680
not but we came up into here

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,080
tapped up into that area

69
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:40,599
there and this is what I love about um

70
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:42,519
you know these plays at

71
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,720
least because um if you ever end up in

72
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,879
any type of draw down from from where

73
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,280
some of these entries are you know like

74
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,239
let's say you thought it was shorting

75
00:03:55,239 --> 00:03:57,799
here and you end up pushing up here

76
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:01,239
ended up what 20 Pips and dra on it so

77
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,760
it still came back to the entry um here

78
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,439
maybe you know one pip less um but it

79
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,239
still came back to the entry allowed you

80
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:17,400
to get out and then flip your

81
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:32,320
bias so I'm to top down in a few um good

82
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,600
morning thank you for blessing us with

83
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,080
your knowledge once again you're welcome

84
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:37,240
Walter you know I was looking at

85
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,080
something interest in

86
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:42,240
um with uh YouTube the demographics of

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:45,080
people that watch and it seems like most

88
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:47,320
of the people that watch are between 25

89
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:51,680
and 35 and then there's that 35 to 45

90
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,520
age bracket that you know I only have a

91
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:57,360
very small portion of viewers with and

92
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,759
then the people underneath the 25 age

93
00:05:00,759 --> 00:05:04,440
bracket it's just like 6% so it seems

94
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,199
like it's the Millennials that you know

95
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,360
I'm really just stuck within that crowd

96
00:05:10,360 --> 00:05:12,360
I mean I'm Millennial too you know it's

97
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,639
probably just the same beliefs that we

98
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:16,240
have and

99
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,560
stuff um so this could have been tapping

100
00:05:18,560 --> 00:05:22,720
into here because of this here so there

101
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,039
was this low put

102
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:30,479
in this High put in

103
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:31,960
and if you

104
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:35,039
look when price ran out of the area

105
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:37,720
right across

106
00:05:38,199 --> 00:05:41,199
here when price came out of this area

107
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,319
here let me fatten that up for you guys

108
00:05:44,319 --> 00:05:48,039
when price came out of this area

109
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:54,680
here when it traded below this area and

110
00:05:54,680 --> 00:05:58,479
the low of this area it never came back

111
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,840
in so although a wick came out and then

112
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:06,039
came back up I always talk about there

113
00:06:06,039 --> 00:06:09,759
being second rejections when it returns

114
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,080
to an area that it quickly traded away

115
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,560
from so we got the quick trade away from

116
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,120
the area with this

117
00:06:16,120 --> 00:06:18,759
pullback we come back into the area

118
00:06:18,759 --> 00:06:21,840
again we get a rejection from this area

119
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,919
back

120
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:26,400
down why because when a body closes

121
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:29,120
below the area and then comes back into

122
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,520
the area

123
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,000
area often times that's the touch you

124
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:36,400
want to see but sometimes there's a wick

125
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,520
that could pull out of the area and come

126
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,120
back in and then take you short and

127
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,599
later on when price returns there again

128
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:45,759
there's usually another rejection

129
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,120
waiting so that's more than likely um

130
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,680
you know what took place in here but it

131
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,560
looks like

132
00:06:53,560 --> 00:06:56,800
um you know there's

133
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,919
some well we ran this low here here so

134
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,879
after running this

135
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,800
low here we have this high as well up

136
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:11,199
above here but because this High pushed

137
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,000
up and came tuck and tucked back into

138
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,919
the range of it price could

139
00:07:16,919 --> 00:07:21,319
react here exactly where it's reacting

140
00:07:21,319 --> 00:07:24,039
now because of

141
00:07:24,039 --> 00:07:27,960
um the uh this Wick went Above This high

142
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:30,240
and traded back inside of

143
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,919
it so the reaction you expect is from

144
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:37,440
the body of the candle rather than the

145
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:39,360
wick price could still make its way back

146
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,240
up here to this Wick because this is a

147
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:44,919
hidden snd Zone that they left above but

148
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:47,360
we saw the rejection from

149
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,879
here because if you take the low and you

150
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,400
take this body right here you measure

151
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,759
that out price came back into this area

152
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:00,599
tapped in and then rejected away

153
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:03,720
so when now now what I'm expecting is

154
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,680
potentially the Run of this low maybe

155
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,520
come back into this area and then short

156
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,599
that could be a possibility or it could

157
00:08:10,599 --> 00:08:12,879
be a second tap on this imbalance and

158
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,479
then price takes the

159
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:18,960
highs because if it goes above this High

160
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:21,440
here this high and this High they're

161
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:23,680
already mitigated I mean they have small

162
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,800
snd zones well this one was mitigated

163
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:27,599
this one has a small snd Zone on top of

164
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,479
it but that potentially so see we just

165
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:33,879
got the run of the the

166
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:37,360
low we got the run of the low

167
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,559
here I'm going to do the top down in a

168
00:08:39,559 --> 00:08:41,279
few I'm going to spend probably like an

169
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:44,399
extra 45 minutes or so on here because

170
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:46,200
of the uh technical

171
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:48,000
difficulties um I want to make sure I'm

172
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,760
not too loud for you guys am I

173
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,880
loud look we got the top of this snd

174
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:55,080
Zone

175
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,800
here we'll just see what happens around

176
00:08:57,800 --> 00:08:59,920
here mind you when we're looking for a

177
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
reversal so the top is the scalp and

178
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,440
when we're looking for a reversal we're

179
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:05,240
looking for a return back to this area

180
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:08,200
and consolidate so the top is always the

181
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:11,519
first scalp up which if we tapped here

182
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,360
and we pushed up here it's about 14 Pips

183
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:17,320
or so just on a

184
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,399
top wow I wonder if I'm getting

185
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,839
allergies so look we went below this

186
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:33,320
low now we can come back up into this

187
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,560
area or even up into this area

188
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,839
here and we'll wait to see what we get

189
00:09:38,839 --> 00:09:42,279
up here but we could possibly get a

190
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:01,120
rejection and then when we ran this slow

191
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,160
so maybe somewhere within here it comes

192
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,200
up to or maybe up into the hidden snd

193
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,279
that was left behind because we already

194
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,800
got this rejection from here down to

195
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,320
here but you see how this becomes so

196
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,839
easy we mentioned this rejection here

197
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:22,240
when this green candle was up in here

198
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:24,000
and we had said okay this is probably

199
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,560
rejecting out of this area from here

200
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:28,320
because this Wick is manipulation you

201
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:30,279
don't count the wick

202
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:32,959
and then look we get the short from

203
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,839
there to

204
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:37,839
here it could have been a potential

205
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,040
short from here but price ran through it

206
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,079
and just came to this area

207
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:45,040
here and we got the wick

208
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,040
rejection and then we push back up this

209
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:51,000
could be a fractal that it's rejecting

210
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:54,160
off of to come back down to here I can

211
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,720
test this area again and then pull back

212
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,639
up to here maybe to test this area up

213
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:04,120
here maybe reject back down run the lows

214
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:08,120
possibly into this snd then tap this snd

215
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,720
and then take the highest possibilities

216
00:11:11,720 --> 00:11:15,040
it's just if if this is how if this is

217
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,880
what I'm anticipating price to to do

218
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,120
then I'm looking to get involved in

219
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:23,200
those different types of movements so

220
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,839
you see I said we just rejected from the

221
00:11:24,839 --> 00:11:27,399
fractal when coming down here there's

222
00:11:27,399 --> 00:11:31,120
this snd here that's not fully mitigated

223
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,200
this one did get mitigated but we can

224
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,120
get a double tap in this area and then

225
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,800
start to look to go for some of the

226
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,240
highs maybe within this area or this

227
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,600
area up here or price is going just

228
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:45,240
short right through here and come down

229
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:48,480
to here you just got to always keep that

230
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:51,120
possibility

231
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,440
open

232
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
yeah

233
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:14,519
let's see I'm going to do the top down

234
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:17,320
in uh five minutes or

235
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:22,760
so um I hope that's okay with you

236
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:30,880
guys

237
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,000
look we got this tap here spring up to

238
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:41,560
here we come down

239
00:12:41,560 --> 00:12:44,600
here now we want to look and see if we

240
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:48,079
get some sideways movement within this

241
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:50,760
region to give us some signal that it

242
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:53,199
could be

243
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:56,839
reversing but we could get a tap into

244
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:00,839
this snd here

245
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:11,240
and I'm wondering if we tap down into

246
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:13,480
this

247
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:18,160
snd if we'd end up coming above this to

248
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,240
hit this area after maybe come back down

249
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:25,160
into this area and then possibly look to

250
00:13:25,160 --> 00:13:27,959
take the highs and it'll look like that

251
00:13:27,959 --> 00:13:29,720
Candlestick pattern that I usually tell

252
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:32,959
you guys about it's a

253
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,120
possibility this is a double tap on the

254
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:37,279
imbalance right here so it could very

255
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,920
well be the imbalance that does

256
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:47,079
that then you want to see a flip above

257
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:50,800
here price come back into the area

258
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:52,519
here and

259
00:13:52,519 --> 00:13:57,759
then potentially look to take this High

260
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
here

261
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:06,880
possibilities again we still have this

262
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,320
area

263
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,639
here just below

264
00:14:11,639 --> 00:14:14,720
it it's just hypothesizing this is

265
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,839
wouldn't be a a trade that I would be in

266
00:14:16,839 --> 00:14:19,079
or

267
00:14:21,839 --> 00:14:26,000
anything unless it showed me those

268
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:30,680
rules

269
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:44,560
trying to be an

270
00:14:48,680 --> 00:14:51,440
artist so what we get to tap back into

271
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,720
this

272
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,680
area and then what are we going to do

273
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,680
here we got a equal high right here on

274
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:04,320
Candlestick

275
00:15:11,839 --> 00:15:15,120
structure see

276
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,320
that so let's see if it then puts in the

277
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,959
low and then runs this

278
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,600
high

279
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,680
and if you guys have any charts any

280
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:35,279
tickers you want me to look at I'll

281
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:38,880
definitely take a look at it for you

282
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,480
guys look at that see even on

283
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
Candlestick structure equal High Here We

284
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:48,680
Run not this low not only this low but

285
00:15:48,680 --> 00:15:50,600
we run the second low too responsible

286
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,079
for the equal High I'm telling you you

287
00:15:53,079 --> 00:15:56,000
see this stuff everywhere EU

288
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,880
um I think I did some work on EU

289
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:01,839
yesterday

290
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:05,000
um was

291
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:14,000
it yeah probably did let me go to what

292
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:16,920
what time frame do you

293
00:16:21,240 --> 00:16:24,560
want oh yeah look I did

294
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:27,519
have something

295
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:29,680
here

296
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:32,519
where it tapped

297
00:16:32,680 --> 00:16:35,279
into I don't remember what this is so

298
00:16:35,279 --> 00:16:36,480
don't quote

299
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:39,480
me

300
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:48,920
uh oh one minute okay um so let me look

301
00:16:48,920 --> 00:16:52,120
at the 15 minute right

302
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,560
now uh we came up into this we got a

303
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,440
rejection from this imbalance

304
00:17:00,440 --> 00:17:03,360
we mitigated this entire area but this

305
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:06,799
looks like it could be coming

306
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:12,559
here it going be coming up to here and

307
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,319
possibly

308
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:17,600
um get

309
00:17:18,039 --> 00:17:21,679
rejected from here

310
00:17:21,679 --> 00:17:25,280
um let me

311
00:17:26,199 --> 00:17:30,400
see uh

312
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:35,200
could go like

313
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,720
this could do that even even up until

314
00:17:41,720 --> 00:17:46,039
this Wick even could do that as well but

315
00:17:46,039 --> 00:17:49,720
this is an imbalance rejection I

316
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:55,880
believe yeah this is a rejection at the

317
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:58,480
imbalance so you could have a second tap

318
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:00,559
up into the imbalance and then a short

319
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,919
from it um or you could just be shorting

320
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:05,280
from this so both of these lines that

321
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,480
are already here are uh perfect for that

322
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:15,880
it's here or here 53 54 one of those

323
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,159
um yeah that's what I'm thinking we ran

324
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:19,880
both of these highs

325
00:18:19,880 --> 00:18:22,880
already

326
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:27,320
uh yeah so the Run of this High could

327
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:31,080
facilitate back into here somewhere and

328
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:33,600
then another push above but let me look

329
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:36,440
at the one minute

330
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:45,039
now

331
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,799
so there's a minor imbalance in

332
00:18:49,799 --> 00:18:52,799
here

333
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,520
uh so it could be between these two

334
00:18:59,520 --> 00:19:02,080
areas

335
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:11,679
here could be between this area here um

336
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:12,960
the only thing you want to be

337
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:17,320
considerate of is um let me actually

338
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:19,960
see uh so we got the imbalance here we

339
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,880
got the snd above here there's this

340
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,159
other imbalance inside of

341
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,240
here which I don't really see

342
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:33,000
we lingered around here

343
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:35,280
fell I don't really see that this

344
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,760
imbalance is important but it could

345
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:41,520
be um because

346
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:44,559
of could form an equal High when it gets

347
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,720
up here and then end up running the

348
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:51,559
low um which would make it consistent

349
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:53,240
with

350
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:57,200
this tap up into the area run the low

351
00:19:57,200 --> 00:19:59,320
potentially get a along

352
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:01,559
from down

353
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,760
here to take you up

354
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:08,200
further let me

355
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,320
see slight imbalance

356
00:20:12,320 --> 00:20:16,200
here yeah so just watch this area

357
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:18,520
here

358
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:23,320
um very minor minor

359
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:25,640
imbalance and I mean even if it's minor

360
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:28,679
it's still an imbalance

361
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:32,679
um and then you also have one down

362
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:38,240
here so this is just after you see a

363
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,720
rejection and then you see a bearish

364
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:44,799
flip that happens up here this is when

365
00:20:44,799 --> 00:20:47,159
you want to look to potentially get out

366
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:50,360
of here get out of along here maybe

367
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:52,799
somewhere up within this region only if

368
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,320
you see a bearish flip if you don't see

369
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,200
a bearish flip you're not getting out

370
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,640
you're taking this bad boy wherever it's

371
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:01,640
going so um if you see that um and you

372
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,080
get a rejection from up here the

373
00:21:03,080 --> 00:21:06,360
rejection can possibly come to the

374
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:09,440
downside of

375
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,760
here

376
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,320
here or

377
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,039
here or here

378
00:21:27,039 --> 00:21:30,039
sorry

379
00:21:30,640 --> 00:21:34,039
so save these areas for later because

380
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:36,960
later on you might actually have price

381
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:39,200
come back to these areas and still give

382
00:21:39,200 --> 00:21:43,120
you a reaction off of them um what is

383
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:46,559
that 105

384
00:21:48,039 --> 00:21:51,760
353 uh 105 353 this is just an

385
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,120
imbalance I believe from the higher time

386
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:55,600
frame which time frame was I just on the

387
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,039
15

388
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,080
minute uh no that's not that's this snd

389
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:03,159
Zone

390
00:22:03,159 --> 00:22:05,679
here yeah that's this snd Zone here so

391
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:09,039
you see I would just push through

392
00:22:09,080 --> 00:22:14,120
that and it hit the imbalance that's in

393
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,799
here yeah this was a little tiny

394
00:22:20,799 --> 00:22:23,320
imbalance that we said was in here you

395
00:22:23,320 --> 00:22:25,240
see why imbalances are more important

396
00:22:25,240 --> 00:22:28,240
than than zones at least for me you know

397
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,480
other people may

398
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:34,840
um think something differently but um

399
00:22:34,840 --> 00:22:36,600
then you have a minor imbalance in here

400
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,480
so watch it that's where price could

401
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,440
potentially tap find support and push

402
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:42,240
you back up and then you can get your

403
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,039
equal high up here possibly where the

404
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:49,120
equal high will facilitate the

405
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,720
um the run of the

406
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:56,440
lows so yeah you just want to um pay

407
00:22:56,440 --> 00:22:59,960
attention to that

408
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:05,840
um let me see Torres what's up how's

409
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:07,919
everything

410
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:10,919
uh hey Dave the EA teacher why going up

411
00:23:10,919 --> 00:23:12,440
I didn't miss the top down no you didn't

412
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:14,640
miss the top down yet actually I'm like

413
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
five minutes late six minutes now on the

414
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,799
top down cuz I was uh looking at EU my

415
00:23:19,799 --> 00:23:22,559
bad um see look at what I was saying

416
00:23:22,559 --> 00:23:26,640
guys about this rejection

417
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:28,760
here

418
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:30,679
you see what I was

419
00:23:30,679 --> 00:23:33,559
saying I said we can tap back into this

420
00:23:33,559 --> 00:23:36,200
area but look we didn't even get the tap

421
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:39,000
we did get the flip though cuz look we

422
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:42,240
flipped Above This equal

423
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:44,480
High yeah I'm telling you guys this is

424
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:47,279
like sauce sauce sauce man we flipped

425
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,120
Above This equal High here we pushed

426
00:23:50,120 --> 00:23:52,679
above it with this green candle this red

427
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:55,919
candle tapped us back into this

428
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,440
area and then took us out

429
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:01,559
out to go above to

430
00:24:01,559 --> 00:24:04,200
where the areas above that I mentioned

431
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,080
we

432
00:24:05,080 --> 00:24:08,279
had and we even tapped into the hidden

433
00:24:08,279 --> 00:24:11,080
snd Zone that's

434
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:13,520
here so this is exactly what I'm talking

435
00:24:13,520 --> 00:24:15,760
about like I I mentioned that it could

436
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,840
possibly do that and I said we could

437
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,640
possibly run this High remember I put a

438
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:21,720
circle around it I said we could

439
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,000
potentially dip back in here come up

440
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,120
above this high and then have a

441
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:29,679
retracement back in what broke this high

442
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:33,440
this snd down here within this region so

443
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,520
you can get a tap into this region and

444
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,520
then get a long out of it to potentially

445
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:41,760
take the highs but be careful because

446
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,760
this could be the Candlestick pattern

447
00:24:44,760 --> 00:24:48,200
that we always talk about

448
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:52,039
here this could very well be a beish

449
00:24:52,039 --> 00:24:55,679
flip look we ran under this

450
00:24:55,679 --> 00:24:58,559
low we came up

451
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:01,440
we violated the low we

452
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,120
retraced and this could essentially take

453
00:25:04,120 --> 00:25:07,840
us further down into this area

454
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,840
here

455
00:25:13,840 --> 00:25:17,559
um all of this is mitigated here

456
00:25:17,559 --> 00:25:21,000
underneath this is mitigated down

457
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:24,159
here I mean there is this little snd

458
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,799
that's unmitigated here but I don't

459
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:28,760
really see price taing into it and

460
00:25:28,760 --> 00:25:31,279
taking out a high cuz it's pretty

461
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,279
small

462
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:39,279
um and even with this

463
00:25:42,039 --> 00:25:45,360
here we didn't run this High

464
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,520
first so if we ran this High came back

465
00:25:48,520 --> 00:25:51,799
into this area and then longed from it

466
00:25:51,799 --> 00:25:55,559
then I would

467
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:58,279
understand there's still some

468
00:25:58,279 --> 00:26:00,600
um let me just go to the higher time let

469
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,440
me do the top down now let me stop

470
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:03,440
wasting

471
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:07,960
time trying to analyze on on my time

472
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,399
frame let me just give you guys a top

473
00:26:10,399 --> 00:26:15,880
down um 6:30

474
00:26:15,880 --> 00:26:17,440
650

475
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:21,240
so this is probably about 25 Pips in

476
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:23,600
difference but we're doing the top down

477
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,559
for the well let me just find something

478
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:29,559
that's that's easier um to use because I

479
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:32,679
hate destroying my history of things but

480
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:34,240
I guess if I do this every day the

481
00:26:34,240 --> 00:26:37,320
history shouldn't matter

482
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,799
right

483
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:45,120
yeah all right let's get the top down in

484
00:26:45,120 --> 00:26:48,960
Armani um last night when I had

485
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,880
mentioned a double tap of the imbalance

486
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,480
um right here I think we were on the 15

487
00:26:55,480 --> 00:26:59,600
minute it might have been

488
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:02,399
let me just show

489
00:27:08,679 --> 00:27:12,159
you remember guys all of this here could

490
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,080
be a violation of this low here we

491
00:27:17,080 --> 00:27:19,399
dropped below we violated this low we

492
00:27:19,399 --> 00:27:21,240
came back up to the snd that was

493
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,279
responsible for violating the low so we

494
00:27:24,279 --> 00:27:27,600
came back up this could very well

495
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:30,159
continue short below this area here

496
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:33,360
below the 200 area down into somewhere

497
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:36,840
within this area

498
00:27:36,840 --> 00:27:39,279
here you know this this could very well

499
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,960
do that so um just be careful of this

500
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:47,360
area um let me go to the

501
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:52,360
Daily uh

502
00:27:55,919 --> 00:28:00,080
let's here we go go a fresh chart let's

503
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:04,679
go ah here we go so

504
00:28:04,679 --> 00:28:07,799
um we have this High

505
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:10,159
here that seems to be looking like a

506
00:28:10,159 --> 00:28:11,880
protected High look at that Candlestick

507
00:28:11,880 --> 00:28:15,360
pattern that we like to talk about here

508
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,600
possibly forming possibly you have the

509
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,760
same thing down on this side

510
00:28:20,760 --> 00:28:24,559
too and you have the same thing up

511
00:28:24,559 --> 00:28:27,200
here and if you look up here there was a

512
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:29,039
short provided if you look up here there

513
00:28:29,039 --> 00:28:32,120
was a long provided back up into this

514
00:28:32,120 --> 00:28:35,080
area which we had talked about this area

515
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:37,440
potentially being the target when we

516
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:40,679
were just down here so we got up into

517
00:28:40,679 --> 00:28:43,640
this area surprised we didn't run this

518
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:46,279
High here

519
00:28:47,000 --> 00:28:49,880
though and if we result in running that

520
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,679
high we may also look to run this

521
00:28:53,679 --> 00:28:56,399
one so these are the same areas that I

522
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,399
had before

523
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:03,399
um this is

524
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:06,000
143 this is

525
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:10,360
970 1043 my bad and this is

526
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:14,159
814 so we also have some areas down

527
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:16,880
below

528
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,000
here which

529
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:27,120
is this here and I'm I'm guessing that

530
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:29,760
just a guess don't quote me on it I'm

531
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:34,519
guessing that this is the um protected

532
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:39,120
low yeah I'm guessing that this is a

533
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:41,600
protected

534
00:29:44,760 --> 00:29:48,679
low um let's

535
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:54,120
see did we mitigate this by at least

536
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,320
50%

537
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:10,799
we came close to it but not

538
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:26,000
much this may be indicating a bearish

539
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,510
day uh let me go to the 4

540
00:30:28,510 --> 00:30:31,320
[Music]

541
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:35,159
Hour oh look at this

542
00:30:35,159 --> 00:30:38,440
yikes but look at this also

543
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,600
below this is something that you want to

544
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,799
pay attention

545
00:30:42,799 --> 00:30:45,559
to I mentioned yesterday that these are

546
00:30:45,559 --> 00:30:48,000
hidden

547
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:52,320
snds so we have this area just

548
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:55,320
above

549
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:59,200
here

550
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:02,080
and then we also have the beginning of

551
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,960
the

552
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:07,200
area because price Taps on the beginning

553
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,480
of these Wicks sometimes and then pushes

554
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:12,159
up off of it so you just want to make

555
00:31:12,159 --> 00:31:14,919
sure you note

556
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:17,919
that

557
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:24,240
um and let's go to the hourly now let's

558
00:31:24,240 --> 00:31:26,919
take a look at what's in the hourly oh

559
00:31:26,919 --> 00:31:30,880
okay we have an equal High here inside

560
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:36,519
of an snd above here I think uh this

561
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:40,639
was aim or Armani I think it was that

562
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:42,000
had mentioned that we were coming back

563
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:45,440
up to um this snd

564
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,399
above this one right

565
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:59,039
here see that

566
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:00,919
see how we got the mitigation

567
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:04,559
of the tap

568
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:09,679
here now this could be a wick fill that

569
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,639
these people be talking

570
00:32:11,639 --> 00:32:15,000
about but

571
00:32:15,399 --> 00:32:19,559
uh ah look at that look at that look at

572
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,000
the Candlestick pattern we like to see I

573
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:26,080
like that inside of a Zone

574
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,360
too I like that I like that for

575
00:32:30,360 --> 00:32:32,799
shorts this

576
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,360
here so we look like we're shorting

577
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:39,720
certainly um we could have a run of this

578
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:41,080
low

579
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,679
first and then

580
00:32:44,679 --> 00:32:48,240
um have price pushed back in before

581
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:51,279
leaving the area back down so just watch

582
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:55,039
it if we run this low um just be mindful

583
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:56,039
of

584
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,240
that uh go down to the

585
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:03,080
five see anything on the

586
00:33:03,080 --> 00:33:05,120
five

587
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:08,039
um so we have the areas Above and Below

588
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:10,880
guys um on the top down I don't know if

589
00:33:10,880 --> 00:33:12,480
I went through that too fast if you guys

590
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,639
want me to go back and you know just

591
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:18,360
give you the areas I can do that

592
00:33:18,360 --> 00:33:19,919
too

593
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:24,240
um minor imbalance inside of here makes

594
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:29,320
this area probable area to Target Bounce

595
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:33,720
from this imbalance here was filled

596
00:33:33,720 --> 00:33:35,960
already so you disregard that unless

597
00:33:35,960 --> 00:33:38,080
there's a second imbalance touch that's

598
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,080
going to happen here and then push price

599
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:43,000
further so it looks like yeah we're

600
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:45,760
shorting down to

601
00:33:46,519 --> 00:33:49,360
488 another imbalance in between here

602
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,279
just above this Zone but then there's

603
00:33:51,279 --> 00:33:53,799
also one in here so this is what you

604
00:33:53,799 --> 00:33:55,240
want to pay attention to this was

605
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,919
completely filled

606
00:33:58,919 --> 00:34:01,320
so it could be the second Touch of

607
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:06,159
this there's a slight imbalance within

608
00:34:06,519 --> 00:34:09,560
here this one I don't really see this

609
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:12,399
doing anything U but this one there's a

610
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:14,320
possibility I could tap

611
00:34:14,320 --> 00:34:16,800
into so again we could still have the

612
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:19,079
pushes back up retracement into this

613
00:34:19,079 --> 00:34:21,359
area then continuation down you know

614
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:23,960
like you could still get all of that um

615
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:27,000
and you usually get them from uh snds

616
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,639
zones or from

617
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:32,280
um from imbalances I've seen some

618
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:34,359
imbalances break highs and lows like

619
00:34:34,359 --> 00:34:37,399
give you new highs and lows so um that's

620
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:39,199
something that you want to consider look

621
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,639
there's a tap of the center of this

622
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:43,679
imbalance and then price starts to push

623
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:46,199
back up this could either you know just

624
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:48,719
be creating this Wick next candle opens

625
00:34:48,719 --> 00:34:51,520
maybe retraces below comes back in to

626
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,760
fill this imbalance and then leave

627
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:55,320
possibility this is a FIV minute chart

628
00:34:55,320 --> 00:34:57,280
so that could happen over the next 40

629
00:34:57,280 --> 00:34:59,000
minutes or

630
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:02,000
so

631
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,880
um now we want to see are we going to

632
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,920
get a flip of this

633
00:35:10,460 --> 00:35:14,039
[Music]

634
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:17,960
high and mind you guys that that was the

635
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:23,240
um top down um that I did that's overall

636
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,400
um and then when I come down to the one

637
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,720
minute what I'm usually teaching is the

638
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:29,800
movements of the

639
00:35:29,800 --> 00:35:32,440
algorithm so if this if this does come

640
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:34,839
back above this more than likely it

641
00:35:34,839 --> 00:35:38,920
would be coming back to tap into um the

642
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,960
imbalance that's

643
00:35:43,839 --> 00:35:47,160
here that's

644
00:35:48,960 --> 00:35:52,760
here did this get

645
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:58,800
any play yeah did there

646
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:02,040
it didn't

647
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,160
there so we could have a touchdown into

648
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:07,440
this and then I'm push up from

649
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,680
here or again we could just end up

650
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:13,040
running the low and then the low is

651
00:36:13,040 --> 00:36:17,040
where we have that excitatory pushup we

652
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,640
got a minor imbalance within here I told

653
00:36:19,640 --> 00:36:22,440
you I'm going to imbalance you guys to

654
00:36:22,440 --> 00:36:25,720
death so you understand how how

655
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,240
important these areas

656
00:36:27,240 --> 00:36:32,319
are and I've I've you know done many

657
00:36:32,319 --> 00:36:34,800
many many like whenever I introduce

658
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:37,839
something to you guys I've done many

659
00:36:37,839 --> 00:36:41,200
many many many hours of of going back

660
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:44,760
over it and and looking at you know it I

661
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:46,000
I would say

662
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:48,079
that you know I found it about

663
00:36:48,079 --> 00:36:50,119
imbalances like what

664
00:36:50,119 --> 00:36:52,760
maybe I don't know was it last week or

665
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,680
something can't remember it was track

666
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,280
effects teaching it um

667
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,400
find out about it then

668
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:02,079
and like I just see how powerful it is

669
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:04,119
back testing it and I back tested it for

670
00:37:04,119 --> 00:37:06,800
probably about I don't know 40 hours or

671
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,240
so um and it's interesting because you

672
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,880
see I said I back tested it 40 hours

673
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:15,200
people and forward tested it but um

674
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:17,640
people tend to put that time into a job

675
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,240
so to have an extra 40 hours to do

676
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:22,800
something outside of the job can be

677
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:25,920
taxing for them so that's why I do it I

678
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,400
know when my friends are struggling

679
00:37:27,400 --> 00:37:29,160
trading Forex I was trying to figure out

680
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:30,640
the ways that they were trading and just

681
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:32,720
tried to make it better look this could

682
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,640
be a double bottom within this area here

683
00:37:34,640 --> 00:37:36,880
on a lower time frame so this could

684
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,319
facilitate the break of this

685
00:37:42,440 --> 00:37:45,640
above right

686
00:37:51,079 --> 00:37:54,319
here or maybe

687
00:37:54,319 --> 00:38:00,359
not I know um there was one earlier

688
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,960
uh I don't remember what time frame I

689
00:38:02,960 --> 00:38:05,079
was

690
00:38:05,079 --> 00:38:07,079
on

691
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:09,520
um it was one of these time oh it's this

692
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,000
one here wait was it no I wasn't

693
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,200
streaming when I mentioned it it was

694
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:18,319
here right

695
00:38:18,319 --> 00:38:22,040
here this is a double

696
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,839
bottom on a lower time frame you have

697
00:38:25,839 --> 00:38:29,400
this push down push back up you have

698
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,560
this down again right here and then you

699
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,240
have the pushup and mind you I'm not

700
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,440
saying double bottom double top as in

701
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:43,000
like retail patterns it's more just a

702
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:45,920
double tap in the same

703
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:48,240
area so look you see how we got the tap

704
00:38:48,240 --> 00:38:50,839
of this we never made it above this high

705
00:38:50,839 --> 00:38:52,960
this is why the tap is always the scalp

706
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,119
and the structural break above is the

707
00:38:56,119 --> 00:38:59,880
long longer move when it comes back

708
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:02,880
down so the structural break above will

709
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:05,000
tap into maybe the imbalance imbalance

710
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,560
would form the pullback then the

711
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,720
pullback would be facilitated by coming

712
00:39:08,720 --> 00:39:12,599
into an snd and then it'll be sent above

713
00:39:12,599 --> 00:39:15,680
the imbalance and that's how it usually

714
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,319
forms like look at right

715
00:39:23,079 --> 00:39:27,319
here we have this low put in

716
00:39:27,319 --> 00:39:30,720
we have this higher R tapped into this

717
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,720
imbalance we have a low put in again we

718
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,040
got the double tap on the imbalance to

719
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,640
the left so that facilitated the

720
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:41,800
pullback we tapped into this snd here

721
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:43,720
that facilitated the push out of the

722
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:45,680
area and the reason why you're expecting

723
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:47,520
it to come out of this area is because

724
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:49,440
this imbalance is already

725
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:51,880
mitigated and this snd here was

726
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,280
mitigated as

727
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:55,839
well so when you get this tap you're

728
00:39:55,839 --> 00:39:57,920
looking for a clean tap to come out of

729
00:39:57,920 --> 00:39:59,960
this area and just come straight up to

730
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:01,800
the next area what's the next area the

731
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,599
imbalance in here and the snd here this

732
00:40:04,599 --> 00:40:06,720
is an area here too this hidden snd but

733
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:09,040
it's small so it could obviously easily

734
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:11,119
be broken but this imbalance here would

735
00:40:11,119 --> 00:40:12,920
have been the next area and that would

736
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,839
have been directly from here to

737
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:20,520
here quick scalp two minutes got you 95

738
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:23,720
Pips if you just noticed that this this

739
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:26,839
flip what's responsible for causing

740
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:29,560
these pullbacks if you just notice that

741
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:32,040
that could help you with in terms of

742
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:35,040
your trading and look even even so let's

743
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:37,079
say you get a structural flip above the

744
00:40:37,079 --> 00:40:40,160
area now you come in you come back into

745
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,560
the area a second time I told you price

746
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:45,880
can come back to your area a second time

747
00:40:45,880 --> 00:40:49,040
it can give you a second entry usually

748
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:50,680
this one could have been the scalp up

749
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:53,520
which is 90 pip scalp up insane and then

750
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:55,440
this one is the second entry here that

751
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:58,040
takes you up to the snd that we actually

752
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,359
get a rejection from we get rejected out

753
00:41:00,359 --> 00:41:02,960
of it then we put in an equal High which

754
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:05,680
usually results in the Run of not just

755
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,920
this low but this low here

756
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:11,000
too if you have those principles I'm I'm

757
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:12,440
I think I was going to write to you guys

758
00:41:12,440 --> 00:41:14,520
I meant to um write to you guys

759
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,960
yesterday that the key to your next

760
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:20,599
level in life is just understanding this

761
00:41:20,599 --> 00:41:22,920
understanding the why of

762
00:41:22,920 --> 00:41:26,880
this understanding the why of this that

763
00:41:26,880 --> 00:41:29,280
why makes it so much more powerful for

764
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:31,280
you to trade makes it so much more

765
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:34,599
powerful for you to you know like hold

766
00:41:34,599 --> 00:41:39,240
your emotions in a trade so you know if

767
00:41:39,240 --> 00:41:41,760
you get that you've you've gotten the

768
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:44,160
key to your next level in life and

769
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,280
that's why I put an emphasis on that

770
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:48,240
repetition is the mother of learning we

771
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:51,040
teach children not only discipline but

772
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,760
we teach them discipline through routine

773
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:56,560
routine always will be the thing thing

774
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,240
that sharpens anything that you do

775
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:02,720
anything routine is it so that's just

776
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,960
something that you guys want to consider

777
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,480
um you know when trading again we get

778
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:10,119
this equal High out of this area as I

779
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:11,920
mentioned but there's there's rules to

780
00:42:11,920 --> 00:42:14,160
the equal High look there's an

781
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:17,800
unmitigated area right up here this area

782
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:21,319
here I don't know what happened

783
00:42:21,319 --> 00:42:27,400
here because this candle closed up here

784
00:42:27,400 --> 00:42:29,400
at

785
00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:35,960
7:01 but then it opened up up here at

786
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,720
720 but clearly this is manipulation

787
00:42:38,720 --> 00:42:40,520
this was supposed to be like a huge Wick

788
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,240
or something up you know it ended up

789
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:46,079
just gapping up and coming back down but

790
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:49,760
um this is a gap fill right here this is

791
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:53,559
also the mitigation of an snd or a

792
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,200
bearish order block up here

793
00:42:57,200 --> 00:43:00,200
so there's rules to all of this it's not

794
00:43:00,200 --> 00:43:01,920
jumping in just because you see a equal

795
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:04,040
high or you see a equal low there's

796
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:06,760
rules to it and then when we talk about

797
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:08,960
the head and shoulders patterns you know

798
00:43:08,960 --> 00:43:10,720
that that people use I always talk about

799
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:12,720
it because I see it all the time I can't

800
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,000
unsee it but look you have this here you

801
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:18,319
have

802
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:20,680
maybe I don't know would you have used

803
00:43:20,680 --> 00:43:23,599
this High here

804
00:43:23,599 --> 00:43:27,400
maybe we tuck back into the this

805
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:29,920
area and then we push up here maybe

806
00:43:29,920 --> 00:43:31,720
they're looking at this little slanted

807
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,720
function as like the next the neckline

808
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:35,119
break or

809
00:43:35,119 --> 00:43:39,599
something and then you get in for a long

810
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:42,480
here targeting whatever up here and look

811
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:45,720
you get dragged back down here that's

812
00:43:45,720 --> 00:43:46,800
why you don't want to trade these

813
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,599
patterns um unless there's structure

814
00:43:49,599 --> 00:43:51,200
involved in

815
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:53,720
it but yeah we get that top and we come

816
00:43:53,720 --> 00:43:56,160
down into this area and then what do we

817
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:59,920
we come to we come into this area

818
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,760
here right

819
00:44:01,760 --> 00:44:04,800
here is this filling the imbalance I

820
00:44:04,800 --> 00:44:07,119
don't know could continue down we did

821
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:10,400
have what was this lower area here 488

822
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:12,960
what did we say was was here on the top

823
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,480
down I can't even

824
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:15,500
remember

825
00:44:15,500 --> 00:44:18,520
[Music]

826
00:44:18,520 --> 00:44:21,160
um oh but this is still equal highs from

827
00:44:21,160 --> 00:44:23,839
a higher time frame so 428 is look we're

828
00:44:23,839 --> 00:44:26,079
looking for potentially a bounce here

829
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:28,280
here there could be a bounce back up

830
00:44:28,280 --> 00:44:31,520
into this area and then you leave out of

831
00:44:31,520 --> 00:44:34,000
it it can come back up into like

832
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:35,720
somewhere around here somewhere around

833
00:44:35,720 --> 00:44:39,599
the 600 area and then continue down or

834
00:44:39,599 --> 00:44:41,680
it can just continue down from here but

835
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:42,920
this is the area that we said we were

836
00:44:42,920 --> 00:44:45,200
shorting

837
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:47,520
to this is why the top down is so

838
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:49,240
important for you guys like I continue

839
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,400
to talk about the top down all the time

840
00:44:51,400 --> 00:44:53,160
even though I'm like putting all of

841
00:44:53,160 --> 00:44:54,640
these different areas here talking to

842
00:44:54,640 --> 00:44:56,400
you about what could potentially happen

843
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:59,960
the top down still is like the ruler of

844
00:44:59,960 --> 00:45:01,800
everything that's whether we're going

845
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:03,359
for some highs above that's whether

846
00:45:03,359 --> 00:45:05,720
we're coming below it's the ruler of

847
00:45:05,720 --> 00:45:08,359
everything and that's you know kind of

848
00:45:08,359 --> 00:45:10,520
what what I want to get you guys to um

849
00:45:10,520 --> 00:45:13,160
to

850
00:45:13,319 --> 00:45:16,839
understand so if you look at here um on

851
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:18,800
the one minute we got a double tap

852
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:21,319
within this

853
00:45:22,520 --> 00:45:26,119
area so this could just be looking to

854
00:45:26,119 --> 00:45:27,960
come up to like an imbalance or

855
00:45:27,960 --> 00:45:29,200
something like that that's up here

856
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,520
before oh this was the the the imbalance

857
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:33,400
rejection right

858
00:45:33,400 --> 00:45:37,119
here um that I just I forgot who A was

859
00:45:37,119 --> 00:45:39,079
it chain okay yeah this was the

860
00:45:39,079 --> 00:45:41,880
imbalance rejection right here

861
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:46,280
596 and look at this back down 26 Pips

862
00:45:46,280 --> 00:45:48,760
in 11

863
00:45:48,920 --> 00:45:51,920
minutes on a pair

864
00:45:51,920 --> 00:45:54,839
um EA teacher can you do I love that

865
00:45:54,839 --> 00:45:57,760
name EA teacher

866
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,920
uh Nas 100 okay um Nas is doing the same

867
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:05,880
thing as us30 shorting down um if we

868
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:08,800
want me to go to like the hourly maybe

869
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:13,680
um just take a look at this so the us30

870
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,880
we put equal highs on the hourly but on

871
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:19,839
the nas we went higher than the previous

872
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:21,680
high so

873
00:46:21,680 --> 00:46:24,040
um I wonder if the NASA is doing good

874
00:46:24,040 --> 00:46:27,240
but the us30 is doing bad look we have

875
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:30,280
the break of a high on on this as well

876
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:33,240
but we came very far into this area

877
00:46:33,240 --> 00:46:35,000
after running this high

878
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,680
so uh this looks like it could still be

879
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:42,440
coming down um this was an imbalance tap

880
00:46:42,440 --> 00:46:44,440
to take us up the imbalance gave us the

881
00:46:44,440 --> 00:46:46,800
run up the high but it's a wick of

882
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,319
course not a break of structure so we

883
00:46:49,319 --> 00:46:53,559
have this area here we have a equal High

884
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:57,800
inside of an snd

885
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:03,920
um we have this snd below

886
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:08,680
here we have this snd below so Nas could

887
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,240
be coming down to this here oh is this n

888
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,200
this is this isn't even

889
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,440
n my bad so look this is

890
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:22,559
exactly this is mitigated this this

891
00:47:22,559 --> 00:47:24,040
mitigated this

892
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:29,559
area this this candle here on the US 500

893
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:31,920
this area is not

894
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:34,920
mitigated and on the us30 this area is

895
00:47:34,920 --> 00:47:36,599
not mitigated look we just made it to

896
00:47:36,599 --> 00:47:41,119
our 488 area woo TP smash guys right

897
00:47:41,119 --> 00:47:44,119
yay I don't know why people do

898
00:47:44,119 --> 00:47:47,680
that uh cuz I could just call another

899
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,000
one let me

900
00:47:53,440 --> 00:47:56,640
see yep we mitigated this hit an snd

901
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:02,000
here too uh did we really

902
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:06,319
uh let me see we traded

903
00:48:06,319 --> 00:48:09,040
above came back in tapped into the area

904
00:48:09,040 --> 00:48:11,599
could get a double tap within this area

905
00:48:11,599 --> 00:48:13,760
um so Nas could be coming back to this

906
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:15,800
area um

907
00:48:15,800 --> 00:48:20,119
11581 if it's not coming back there

908
00:48:20,119 --> 00:48:23,480
then I mean if it if it runs this low I

909
00:48:23,480 --> 00:48:26,720
really don't see anything else down here

910
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,160
um that NZ

911
00:48:29,160 --> 00:48:31,760
could find support on because you

912
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:34,720
already have this

913
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:37,000
um this double

914
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:40,200
bottom entry up into this area then you

915
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:41,880
get this double

916
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:45,160
top so it can come here and potentially

917
00:48:45,160 --> 00:48:47,920
go back up or it can just run these lows

918
00:48:47,920 --> 00:48:50,760
and come back down to this area here and

919
00:48:50,760 --> 00:48:53,720
that's just from the hourly time frame

920
00:48:53,720 --> 00:48:58,319
um so yeah yeah it could potentially be

921
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:01,040
that let me look at a lower time frame

922
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,119
15 minutes see what we're doing here so

923
00:49:03,119 --> 00:49:04,599
we have this little Candlestick pattern

924
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:08,000
that we like to see

925
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:12,400
here

926
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:18,799
um we have this area

927
00:49:20,319 --> 00:49:23,400
here and then we still have the 581 area

928
00:49:23,400 --> 00:49:27,520
but looks like we also have an area here

929
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,520
at

930
00:49:36,520 --> 00:49:39,000
546 so maybe we get a

931
00:49:39,000 --> 00:49:42,839
mitigation down into this

932
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:46,359
area and if the mitigation holds within

933
00:49:46,359 --> 00:49:47,960
this area we could potentially be

934
00:49:47,960 --> 00:49:52,480
looking to give another

935
00:49:54,520 --> 00:49:56,119
high

936
00:49:56,119 --> 00:50:00,000
because we have we have an equal High

937
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:02,680
here but if we find a strong enough area

938
00:50:02,680 --> 00:50:04,079
to tap

939
00:50:04,079 --> 00:50:07,480
into and then we go long from there wait

940
00:50:07,480 --> 00:50:11,119
so there's this area down

941
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:14,400
here oh but that that doesn't matter

942
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,480
because price gave us a new

943
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:19,880
high so it was imbalance to new

944
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:22,000
High this is why I'm going to imbalance

945
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,559
the hell out of you guys because this is

946
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:26,480
very very powerful to use so we

947
00:50:26,480 --> 00:50:28,960
imbalance to the new high we could have

948
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:31,880
a second tap within the imbalance and

949
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:36,160
then take us up or it can just run this

950
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,119
area remember if it runs this area

951
00:50:39,119 --> 00:50:42,720
then it ends

952
00:50:42,839 --> 00:50:45,839
up so see look where're where this is

953
00:50:45,839 --> 00:50:48,319
the range that we're in between let me

954
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:50,640
show you

955
00:50:50,640 --> 00:50:54,440
guys we're in this range

956
00:50:54,440 --> 00:50:57,440
here

957
00:50:58,119 --> 00:50:59,280
this whole

958
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:02,079
range this is the last low and the last

959
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:04,960
high that was put in So within this

960
00:51:04,960 --> 00:51:06,799
range as I mentioned price can do

961
00:51:06,799 --> 00:51:08,920
whatever it wants go up to the top of

962
00:51:08,920 --> 00:51:10,359
the range come all the way back down to

963
00:51:10,359 --> 00:51:11,720
the bottom of the range come back to the

964
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:15,680
midl range it can do all of that

965
00:51:15,680 --> 00:51:20,920
um if this does run this low though if

966
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:24,839
this does run this low here I'll have it

967
00:51:24,839 --> 00:51:27,599
potentially coming back up to this area

968
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:31,119
here um the 640 area and then continuing

969
00:51:31,119 --> 00:51:34,720
short down to here um if it does run

970
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:35,799
this

971
00:51:35,799 --> 00:51:37,960
low that's kind of what I have but you

972
00:51:37,960 --> 00:51:41,400
want to pay attention to um the S&P 500

973
00:51:41,400 --> 00:51:43,839
as well you wouldn't pay attention to

974
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:46,720
this because they correlate heavy um Nas

975
00:51:46,720 --> 00:51:50,520
and the S&P 500 so um you just want to

976
00:51:50,520 --> 00:51:52,960
look at that um and if you look at that

977
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:55,040
it'll give you some indication on how to

978
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:55,880
um

979
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,200
like when to get out on certain

980
00:51:57,200 --> 00:51:59,559
reversals or or whatever it is like it

981
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:01,599
it would definitely help with that this

982
00:52:01,599 --> 00:52:03,440
is trend line liquidity so this could

983
00:52:03,440 --> 00:52:06,520
potentially all be ran down into like an

984
00:52:06,520 --> 00:52:07,839
area down

985
00:52:07,839 --> 00:52:10,599
here this imbalance was filled there's a

986
00:52:10,599 --> 00:52:13,760
small imbalance in

987
00:52:21,680 --> 00:52:24,079
here so yeah this could tap into an

988
00:52:24,079 --> 00:52:28,640
imbalance above come back back here and

989
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:31,480
then potentially give you a rise back up

990
00:52:31,480 --> 00:52:33,880
into this area

991
00:52:33,880 --> 00:52:36,880
here

992
00:52:37,960 --> 00:52:40,599
uh this could be coming back to this snd

993
00:52:40,599 --> 00:52:42,880
here because structure is just broke

994
00:52:42,880 --> 00:52:47,559
here let's see uh uh uh uh uh so this

995
00:52:47,559 --> 00:52:49,799
broke

996
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:52,200
structure gave us a run of this High

997
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,520
came back down so yeah we could

998
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:57,880
potentially be going up to this area

999
00:53:01,440 --> 00:53:04,720
here for the S&P we could potentially be

1000
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:06,480
coming up to this area and continuing

1001
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:09,839
short but if we come up to this area we

1002
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:13,000
flicker Above This high and then come

1003
00:53:13,000 --> 00:53:15,079
back in it could just be a retracement

1004
00:53:15,079 --> 00:53:17,319
to go

1005
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:20,319
long

1006
00:53:24,160 --> 00:53:26,480
yeah

1007
00:53:26,480 --> 00:53:29,520
so look we got this tap into here we got

1008
00:53:29,520 --> 00:53:30,880
a

1009
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,160
run of the high here we could get a tap

1010
00:53:34,160 --> 00:53:36,400
back

1011
00:53:37,720 --> 00:53:40,599
into well no we got to tap into the area

1012
00:53:40,599 --> 00:53:43,520
just now so now this could look to go

1013
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,920
and take some of the

1014
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:50,079
highs and this is the S&P so Nas and

1015
00:53:50,079 --> 00:53:52,640
us30 could correlate with this if this

1016
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,119
is happening but if this is happening

1017
00:53:55,119 --> 00:53:58,480
Happ in then this would essentially be

1018
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,160
my little Candlestick pattern that I

1019
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:04,799
talk to you guys about all the time

1020
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:09,920
here I got to find a way

1021
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:12,760
to do something with

1022
00:54:12,760 --> 00:54:16,400
that like Market that because it's super

1023
00:54:16,400 --> 00:54:19,240
super powerful look this is the snd that

1024
00:54:19,240 --> 00:54:20,920
broke this High here that's why we

1025
00:54:20,920 --> 00:54:23,240
tapped into this and potentially pushing

1026
00:54:23,240 --> 00:54:27,079
out of there so

1027
00:54:27,799 --> 00:54:30,720
if you look at the us30 and N we didn't

1028
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:33,200
get the break above that high but we did

1029
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,240
get it on Candlestick

1030
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:38,520
structure so you want to watch this area

1031
00:54:38,520 --> 00:54:39,880
because this could be a double bottom

1032
00:54:39,880 --> 00:54:42,079
area too and is this a double bottom

1033
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,000
within an area of

1034
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:51,680
Interest oh look at that bad boy come on

1035
00:54:51,680 --> 00:54:53,920
guys look at that bad

1036
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:57,880
boy oh oh man

1037
00:54:57,880 --> 00:55:00,160
wow I hope you guys are like really

1038
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,640
taking this all in like this is great

1039
00:55:02,640 --> 00:55:07,200
information to like to learn from like

1040
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:13,319
wow and and I'm teaching myself too as

1041
00:55:17,880 --> 00:55:20,799
well the the imbalance okay the term

1042
00:55:20,799 --> 00:55:23,240
imbalance the term imbalance is

1043
00:55:23,240 --> 00:55:25,240
imbalance is always between three C C

1044
00:55:25,240 --> 00:55:27,680
Les there's this one candle here with

1045
00:55:27,680 --> 00:55:29,319
the wick that you

1046
00:55:29,319 --> 00:55:32,839
see there's this longer candle here this

1047
00:55:32,839 --> 00:55:37,359
red candle going up and then there's

1048
00:55:37,359 --> 00:55:40,400
this green candle right

1049
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,000
here

1050
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:45,280
so what happens with this usually is

1051
00:55:45,280 --> 00:55:48,640
between this Wick here and this Wick

1052
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:52,760
here there's no candles on either side

1053
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:56,079
no Wick no bodies on either side so this

1054
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,680
entire area here is considered an

1055
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:03,640
imbalance price moved too fast going

1056
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:08,400
down to capture the to to balance the

1057
00:56:08,400 --> 00:56:10,760
cells coming out of the area with

1058
00:56:10,760 --> 00:56:13,880
potential buys coming into this area so

1059
00:56:13,880 --> 00:56:15,640
because you have that huge push out of

1060
00:56:15,640 --> 00:56:17,839
the area we created what's known as an

1061
00:56:17,839 --> 00:56:19,319
imbalance or

1062
00:56:19,319 --> 00:56:22,640
inefficiency or ICT calls it fair value

1063
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:24,960
Gap somebody else calls it like IPA

1064
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:26,079
something there's all these different

1065
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,920
names for it I just prefer imbalance um

1066
00:56:28,920 --> 00:56:32,920
but it's the same concept so this area

1067
00:56:32,920 --> 00:56:38,240
here has a group of of orders of of you

1068
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:41,000
know cells that were waiting to be

1069
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:44,079
filled or or that has to be filled to

1070
00:56:44,079 --> 00:56:46,319
rebalance the market if you have sellers

1071
00:56:46,319 --> 00:56:49,680
you need buyers to fill the orders of

1072
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:52,240
those sellers that's supply and demand

1073
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:55,240
period you know so um what you're

1074
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:58,319
looking for usually is a tap into the

1075
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:00,760
imbalance and often times it's within

1076
00:57:00,760 --> 00:57:03,039
the middle of the imbalance that you get

1077
00:57:03,039 --> 00:57:06,119
the top right here within the middle of

1078
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:07,280
the

1079
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:10,160
imbalance so if you get the top within

1080
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:12,680
the middle of this imbalance often times

1081
00:57:12,680 --> 00:57:15,680
price would come up tap in reject away

1082
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:17,559
and then you may get another tap and

1083
00:57:17,559 --> 00:57:19,680
that other tap may even come through the

1084
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:22,839
imbalance and then you see that double

1085
00:57:22,839 --> 00:57:25,079
top that's there and then you you can

1086
00:57:25,079 --> 00:57:27,039
take that one out the area for a short

1087
00:57:27,039 --> 00:57:30,039
you can take this first one here you can

1088
00:57:30,039 --> 00:57:33,440
take that for a scalp a scalp out of the

1089
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:38,000
area the second one when it returns here

1090
00:57:38,000 --> 00:57:39,480
sorry I'm just like messing up this

1091
00:57:39,480 --> 00:57:42,240
whole thing the second one when it

1092
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:43,319
returns

1093
00:57:43,319 --> 00:57:46,839
here you look within this area and this

1094
00:57:46,839 --> 00:57:48,520
is where you want to see the bearish

1095
00:57:48,520 --> 00:57:51,400
flip you want to see high the highs put

1096
00:57:51,400 --> 00:57:55,400
in lows High put in We Run The Low we

1097
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,559
come back to balance the area there

1098
00:57:58,559 --> 00:58:01,039
could be an imbalance in there too and

1099
00:58:01,039 --> 00:58:03,440
then we short out of the area for a

1100
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,599
longer hole down into somewhere within

1101
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:10,799
you know an area where we begin to see a

1102
00:58:10,799 --> 00:58:13,720
high put in a low put in the high ran a

1103
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:16,319
low brought back into the area and then

1104
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,280
out of the area so it always look like

1105
00:58:19,280 --> 00:58:23,000
that that's the reversal signal it's a

1106
00:58:23,000 --> 00:58:25,760
sign of it reversing for us

1107
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:28,760
this happens this particular formation

1108
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:31,440
now it doesn't always look that way well

1109
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:33,640
it it often looks that way if you have

1110
00:58:33,640 --> 00:58:36,480
the rules of this High being broken and

1111
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,480
this low being broken if you have those

1112
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:40,280
rules it it always looks that way it

1113
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,480
just looks larger or it looks smaller or

1114
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,119
it looks like very tiny candles you

1115
00:58:45,119 --> 00:58:47,960
could find it in different ways but

1116
00:58:47,960 --> 00:58:49,599
that's what you're looking for at the

1117
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,359
second entry of an

1118
00:58:51,359 --> 00:58:53,880
imbalance at the first one it's always a

1119
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,520
quick scalp out of of the area but the

1120
00:58:55,520 --> 00:58:57,960
quick scalp sometimes can just turn into

1121
00:58:57,960 --> 00:59:00,760
a longer move like you see this here

1122
00:59:00,760 --> 00:59:02,880
this is a quick scalp coming from this

1123
00:59:02,880 --> 00:59:05,359
area but if you look to the left you're

1124
00:59:05,359 --> 00:59:09,880
in you're in an area already a a

1125
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:14,079
um a a supply area or an order block or

1126
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,599
or whatever it is you want to call this

1127
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,000
area you're in this point of interest

1128
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:21,079
already so because it tapped this is

1129
00:59:21,079 --> 00:59:23,640
just the double top to your point of

1130
00:59:23,640 --> 00:59:26,559
Interest and then you short coming out

1131
00:59:26,559 --> 00:59:29,119
of the area so you find the point of

1132
00:59:29,119 --> 00:59:32,160
interest you get the scalp first it

1133
00:59:32,160 --> 00:59:36,039
returns to the area and then you short

1134
00:59:36,039 --> 00:59:39,480
out of the area but you short with rules

1135
00:59:39,480 --> 00:59:41,839
what are the rules so look we have this

1136
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:43,480
Candlestick structure I don't know if

1137
00:59:43,480 --> 00:59:46,160
this this actually um went there I'm I'm

1138
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,480
just guessing not guessing really but

1139
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,799
I'm just utilizing

1140
00:59:50,799 --> 00:59:53,640
the Candlestick

1141
00:59:53,640 --> 00:59:57,839
structure so this is a Candlestick short

1142
00:59:57,839 --> 01:00:00,640
or or a Candlestick break we put in this

1143
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:03,319
high and then we ran the low actually no

1144
01:00:03,319 --> 01:00:07,119
I'm actually tripping um because this

1145
01:00:07,119 --> 01:00:09,440
High happened

1146
01:00:09,440 --> 01:00:12,319
before this low was put

1147
01:00:12,319 --> 01:00:16,440
in so this this was it you got a low

1148
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:18,599
here you got a high here you got a

1149
01:00:18,599 --> 01:00:19,920
fractal

1150
01:00:19,920 --> 01:00:23,839
low high here this candle opened up and

1151
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:27,119
continued up then the low that we run is

1152
01:00:27,119 --> 01:00:31,240
this one here we run it with this candle

1153
01:00:31,240 --> 01:00:33,760
so now that we run this low we have this

1154
01:00:33,760 --> 01:00:37,039
entire range through here sorry this

1155
01:00:37,039 --> 01:00:39,359
looks really ugly I'm sorry about that

1156
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:42,280
guys we have this entire range through

1157
01:00:42,280 --> 01:00:43,920
here yeah it just looks bad it looks

1158
01:00:43,920 --> 01:00:46,400
like a broken leg or like somebody bone

1159
01:00:46,400 --> 01:00:48,079
leged up there sorry I'm just very

1160
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:51,079
particular about things but we we come

1161
01:00:51,079 --> 01:00:56,520
back into this area here look at this

1162
01:00:56,680 --> 01:00:59,599
we come back into this area between this

1163
01:00:59,599 --> 01:01:01,400
low and this High We tap back into this

1164
01:01:01,400 --> 01:01:04,240
area and we leave but remember what I

1165
01:01:04,240 --> 01:01:07,799
said about

1166
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:10,000
manipulations I said that we don't count

1167
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:14,000
the wick so we didn't count the wick Bao

1168
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:16,520
our entry is right

1169
01:01:16,520 --> 01:01:18,200
there

1170
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:21,839
beep deep gone tap

1171
01:01:21,839 --> 01:01:26,559
gone out of here bye-bye no draw

1172
01:01:26,559 --> 01:01:29,559
down and this is the first entry here

1173
01:01:29,559 --> 01:01:31,480
stops behind here this is the second

1174
01:01:31,480 --> 01:01:34,240
entry here stops behind here and you

1175
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,640
found two entries to take price down all

1176
01:01:38,640 --> 01:01:41,160
from a POI that you were trading

1177
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:44,079
from and that's essentially what I try

1178
01:01:44,079 --> 01:01:48,680
to you know get people to um essentially

1179
01:01:48,680 --> 01:01:50,599
learn on the channel I get we have this

1180
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:52,520
double tap within this

1181
01:01:52,520 --> 01:01:56,559
area right here but we end up not going

1182
01:01:56,559 --> 01:01:59,720
anywhere what do we have

1183
01:01:59,720 --> 01:02:03,559
here we have price within this area we

1184
01:02:03,559 --> 01:02:05,799
made an equal High here that brought us

1185
01:02:05,799 --> 01:02:07,359
back down

1186
01:02:07,359 --> 01:02:11,200
to this area here so we tapped into this

1187
01:02:11,200 --> 01:02:13,799
area let's say you got a quick scalp up

1188
01:02:13,799 --> 01:02:18,119
here up into this area here it's 30

1189
01:02:18,119 --> 01:02:22,599
Pips now if you saw a double top forming

1190
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:26,880
again within this area here a double top

1191
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:29,079
forming again all of this is within an

1192
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:32,279
imbalance look at

1193
01:02:32,799 --> 01:02:35,520
this there

1194
01:02:35,520 --> 01:02:38,880
there so what do we have the top of an

1195
01:02:38,880 --> 01:02:41,119
imbalance we have the second tap of an

1196
01:02:41,119 --> 01:02:43,760
imbalance quickly traded

1197
01:02:43,760 --> 01:02:47,920
away then we come up we have a third tap

1198
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,640
of it we're we're failing to go above

1199
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,079
this area we get a rejection away again

1200
01:02:54,079 --> 01:02:57,000
but then we get a double top within that

1201
01:02:57,000 --> 01:02:58,799
area and then we

1202
01:02:58,799 --> 01:03:01,279
short so these things you want to pay

1203
01:03:01,279 --> 01:03:02,960
attention to these things that happen

1204
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,079
around these these particular areas you

1205
01:03:06,079 --> 01:03:09,039
want to pay attention to that because

1206
01:03:09,039 --> 01:03:10,880
often times it can give you some

1207
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:13,359
indication even within this area here

1208
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:14,599
give you some indication that we're

1209
01:03:14,599 --> 01:03:16,079
potentially

1210
01:03:16,079 --> 01:03:18,920
shorting because you should see a quick

1211
01:03:18,920 --> 01:03:20,839
tap to your

1212
01:03:20,839 --> 01:03:23,200
area you should see a tap and a quick

1213
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:25,680
move away from it

1214
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:27,799
that's what you should always see tap

1215
01:03:27,799 --> 01:03:29,920
into the area quick move away from

1216
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:32,680
it and if you're not getting

1217
01:03:32,680 --> 01:03:34,920
that you know you're not getting any

1218
01:03:34,920 --> 01:03:36,960
play above this area and you have this

1219
01:03:36,960 --> 01:03:40,440
quick push out of this area three times

1220
01:03:40,440 --> 01:03:42,760
already and then we have a equal High

1221
01:03:42,760 --> 01:03:45,480
put in right here prime example to get

1222
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:48,039
out you get out in what 25 Pips in

1223
01:03:48,039 --> 01:03:49,920
profit or so if you spotted this and

1224
01:03:49,920 --> 01:03:52,240
then you entered into a

1225
01:03:52,240 --> 01:03:54,319
short and then you short it out of the

1226
01:03:54,319 --> 01:03:58,000
the area again hey EA teer Jake that's

1227
01:03:58,000 --> 01:04:01,480
me oh okay okay yeah bangas exactly

1228
01:04:01,480 --> 01:04:03,279
exactly Shan

1229
01:04:03,279 --> 01:04:06,960
bangers calling out

1230
01:04:07,640 --> 01:04:12,119
bangers oh man user Raymond I think what

1231
01:04:12,119 --> 01:04:14,240
you who's who's Usher Raymond don't tell

1232
01:04:14,240 --> 01:04:15,720
me you think I look like Usher don't

1233
01:04:15,720 --> 01:04:17,359
tell me that somebody in Florida told me

1234
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:20,200
that that I am it's my cousin she said

1235
01:04:20,200 --> 01:04:22,720
that I look like um Usher Raymond this

1236
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:27,240
was years ago and I'm like um don't see

1237
01:04:27,240 --> 01:04:29,440
it you know and then with that little

1238
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,359
Scandal he has going on he's giving out

1239
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:36,000
ush bucks instead of um real money so

1240
01:04:36,000 --> 01:04:38,319
when he goes to certain obscene places

1241
01:04:38,319 --> 01:04:40,400
to throw money he's throwing ush bucks

1242
01:04:40,400 --> 01:04:42,319
he's not throwing real money that they

1243
01:04:42,319 --> 01:04:44,520
could

1244
01:04:45,119 --> 01:04:48,839
use wow yeah this is celebrities these

1245
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:51,240
days you

1246
01:04:51,440 --> 01:04:53,880
know see look we get to tap into this

1247
01:04:53,880 --> 01:04:56,440
areir area here the beginning of the

1248
01:04:56,440 --> 01:04:59,400
area and we get a huge pushup not a huge

1249
01:04:59,400 --> 01:05:04,000
but 17 Pips pushup and then we

1250
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:06,039
continue so that's why if we were in

1251
01:05:06,039 --> 01:05:08,200
this short and coming out of the

1252
01:05:08,200 --> 01:05:10,640
short does not

1253
01:05:10,640 --> 01:05:13,240
matter about what happened here didn't

1254
01:05:13,240 --> 01:05:15,000
give us any sideways movement to get out

1255
01:05:15,000 --> 01:05:16,359
so we're

1256
01:05:16,359 --> 01:05:18,680
continuing now we're back into this area

1257
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:22,119
again this area here let's see what

1258
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:24,160
price does with it does it run the low

1259
01:05:24,160 --> 01:05:27,319
or do we catapult out of this area for

1260
01:05:27,319 --> 01:05:29,480
another

1261
01:05:29,480 --> 01:05:32,799
high yeah I I I get that like quite a

1262
01:05:32,799 --> 01:05:35,599
few times where people think that

1263
01:05:35,599 --> 01:05:38,400
um it's like oh you look like Usher I

1264
01:05:38,400 --> 01:05:41,960
don't see it at all like at

1265
01:05:42,920 --> 01:05:46,599
all and his his um his reputation is

1266
01:05:46,599 --> 01:05:49,240
pretty bad right now so I didn't even

1267
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,839
think I want to be compared them so look

1268
01:05:50,839 --> 01:05:52,720
we ta this line

1269
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,440
here and we quickly got to push

1270
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,000
up into this area here 16 Pips off of

1271
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:02,720
this line

1272
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:05,839
alone and and you know I get a lot of

1273
01:06:05,839 --> 01:06:07,599
people who ask how to find these zones

1274
01:06:07,599 --> 01:06:10,200
and I often show it you know

1275
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:13,039
um like I I select exactly what I'm

1276
01:06:13,039 --> 01:06:15,200
doing and I I expect people to see it

1277
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:19,359
and find it as well um you know most of

1278
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:21,319
the time I'm finding things that people

1279
01:06:21,319 --> 01:06:24,720
aren't taking time to show me um and I

1280
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:26,640
just try to simplify it and show others

1281
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:29,880
in a simplified manner you know like I

1282
01:06:29,880 --> 01:06:31,839
could show you

1283
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:35,880
why you know this could be an snd from

1284
01:06:35,880 --> 01:06:37,640
like a higher time frame area or

1285
01:06:37,640 --> 01:06:40,520
something like that um you know go back

1286
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:43,000
and back test all the times where this

1287
01:06:43,000 --> 01:06:46,640
happened um but a lot of the times it's

1288
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,599
that I really really really want people

1289
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:52,760
to like one have some initiative and two

1290
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:56,480
be able to learn this so it could very

1291
01:06:56,480 --> 01:06:59,720
well benefit them this is an area that I

1292
01:06:59,720 --> 01:07:01,839
told you guys about yesterday I said

1293
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:05,599
that this was a hidden area a hidden snd

1294
01:07:05,599 --> 01:07:08,160
Zone that you often have in these Wicks

1295
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:10,200
so look you get a tap from this hidden

1296
01:07:10,200 --> 01:07:12,960
snd Zone and we go all the way up to

1297
01:07:12,960 --> 01:07:17,079
what here what is this 31 Pips on this

1298
01:07:17,079 --> 01:07:20,119
scalp up you're

1299
01:07:20,119 --> 01:07:22,599
out and then if price comes back down

1300
01:07:22,599 --> 01:07:24,079
and gives us like a double bottom

1301
01:07:24,079 --> 01:07:26,000
somewhere within this area then we know

1302
01:07:26,000 --> 01:07:27,839
that we could potentially be gearing to

1303
01:07:27,839 --> 01:07:29,119
come back

1304
01:07:29,119 --> 01:07:32,400
up but if we're not

1305
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:35,599
then you

1306
01:07:36,039 --> 01:07:38,520
know let me actually see so we put in

1307
01:07:38,520 --> 01:07:42,599
this low we took out this

1308
01:07:42,599 --> 01:07:45,079
High I mean we took out this

1309
01:07:45,079 --> 01:07:49,319
low we put in this we put in this High

1310
01:07:49,319 --> 01:07:52,599
took out this low trade it back above

1311
01:07:52,599 --> 01:07:56,920
the high and then came back within this

1312
01:07:56,920 --> 01:07:59,319
area so as long as we don't go below

1313
01:07:59,319 --> 01:08:02,960
this low we could potentially be looking

1314
01:08:02,960 --> 01:08:07,200
to continue

1315
01:08:09,559 --> 01:08:12,960
up cuz I don't really see another area

1316
01:08:12,960 --> 01:08:15,319
down

1317
01:08:16,359 --> 01:08:18,439
here yeah I don't really see another

1318
01:08:18,439 --> 01:08:19,799
area down

1319
01:08:19,799 --> 01:08:25,839
there um could this be the double bottom

1320
01:08:28,520 --> 01:08:30,719
so the reason why I I teach a lot of

1321
01:08:30,719 --> 01:08:33,238
this is because if you guys go back and

1322
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:35,080
watch these videos the same way I

1323
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:37,040
watched all of those garbage videos that

1324
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:39,319
taught me nothing spent hours watching

1325
01:08:39,319 --> 01:08:42,479
them and taught me nothing at all if you

1326
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,640
guys utilize that same amount of

1327
01:08:45,640 --> 01:08:47,799
time

1328
01:08:47,799 --> 01:08:51,759
to to watch the content that I put out

1329
01:08:51,759 --> 01:08:54,479
there you know and you consume it the

1330
01:08:54,479 --> 01:08:58,120
same way like you're writing down taking

1331
01:08:58,120 --> 01:09:02,279
notes of things if you guys do that I

1332
01:09:02,279 --> 01:09:04,080
want you guys to understand that you

1333
01:09:04,080 --> 01:09:06,520
will you will definitely be just as

1334
01:09:06,520 --> 01:09:10,759
profitable you would certainly have just

1335
01:09:10,759 --> 01:09:12,759
as much range that I have in terms of

1336
01:09:12,759 --> 01:09:15,080
trading I can go to any time frame I

1337
01:09:15,080 --> 01:09:16,560
don't know people that have that type of

1338
01:09:16,560 --> 01:09:18,839
range they're either a swing Trader or a

1339
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:21,359
day trader or a

1340
01:09:21,359 --> 01:09:23,600
scalper but I don't know people who have

1341
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:25,600
that same type of

1342
01:09:25,600 --> 01:09:30,560
range to be able to like do it from all

1343
01:09:30,560 --> 01:09:32,880
different time frames there's just a

1344
01:09:32,880 --> 01:09:36,040
select few people that I know that have

1345
01:09:36,040 --> 01:09:38,920
that it's either one specialty or the

1346
01:09:38,920 --> 01:09:41,759
other and some of them got some of them

1347
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:44,640
have have nothing you know no

1348
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:46,560
specialty but they be out there trying

1349
01:09:46,560 --> 01:09:47,839
to scam

1350
01:09:47,839 --> 01:09:50,158
people the the scamming part for me

1351
01:09:50,158 --> 01:09:51,600
that's what that's what makes me kind of

1352
01:09:51,600 --> 01:09:52,719
upset

1353
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:55,080
because people already already don't

1354
01:09:55,080 --> 01:09:56,600
have money to

1355
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,719
waste and if they already don't have

1356
01:09:58,719 --> 01:10:00,520
money to

1357
01:10:00,520 --> 01:10:02,960
waste why are you lying to them about

1358
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:04,440
money that they could

1359
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:06,920
make when you know that you don't even

1360
01:10:06,920 --> 01:10:09,520
know how to get to that level to make it

1361
01:10:09,520 --> 01:10:11,040
you see what I was saying about the the

1362
01:10:11,040 --> 01:10:13,080
the double bottom here guys I said that

1363
01:10:13,080 --> 01:10:16,360
could be the double bottom within

1364
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,960
there look at this madness so you get a

1365
01:10:19,960 --> 01:10:25,040
scalp up that takes you 32 Pips

1366
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:27,800
then you get a longer trade

1367
01:10:27,800 --> 01:10:31,360
up look at this look at this just from

1368
01:10:31,360 --> 01:10:34,320
noticing this and not just noticing this

1369
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:35,920
double bottom in the

1370
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,000
entry not just noticing the double

1371
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,480
bottom in the entry but also noticing

1372
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:43,520
the larger schematic of where we are

1373
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:47,520
here also noticing that we tapped into

1374
01:10:47,520 --> 01:10:49,719
an area to the

1375
01:10:49,719 --> 01:10:54,120
left here so we're within an area where

1376
01:10:54,120 --> 01:10:57,320
we expecting a double bottom or or that

1377
01:10:57,320 --> 01:10:59,960
pattern at least and then within the

1378
01:10:59,960 --> 01:11:01,920
right side of the pattern we're looking

1379
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,520
for the double bottom the first tap of

1380
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:09,400
the pattern is the scalp the second tap

1381
01:11:09,400 --> 01:11:12,560
when it comes back down is the long into

1382
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:14,560
potentially whatever area it could be

1383
01:11:14,560 --> 01:11:16,440
going into now it could be coming here

1384
01:11:16,440 --> 01:11:17,640
or it could be coming to this and

1385
01:11:17,640 --> 01:11:21,120
balance that's here that we have here

1386
01:11:21,120 --> 01:11:23,080
but it's just utilizing the rules it

1387
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:25,080
happens over and over and over and over

1388
01:11:25,080 --> 01:11:26,560
and over and over and over and over and

1389
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,920
over and over just as annoying as that

1390
01:11:28,920 --> 01:11:32,239
gets that's that's how much it happens

1391
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:34,520
within this so what maybe we're going to

1392
01:11:34,520 --> 01:11:36,800
this imbalance here I don't know I

1393
01:11:36,800 --> 01:11:39,520
mentioned that if it comes above here

1394
01:11:39,520 --> 01:11:42,840
this area then within this let me

1395
01:11:42,840 --> 01:11:44,960
actually draw that a little cleaner

1396
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:47,159
before somebody's like you said it was

1397
01:11:47,159 --> 01:11:50,280
going above the red line and it didn't

1398
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:54,639
if it comes above this area here then

1399
01:11:54,639 --> 01:11:56,600
we could potentially be looking to take

1400
01:11:56,600 --> 01:11:58,320
it to

1401
01:11:58,320 --> 01:12:02,320
here this area or potentially even this

1402
01:12:02,320 --> 01:12:04,840
High we can come back to this High a

1403
01:12:04,840 --> 01:12:07,199
second time and this would be what an

1404
01:12:07,199 --> 01:12:10,880
equal high from across the way this

1405
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,360
would be a second rejection out of the

1406
01:12:14,360 --> 01:12:18,880
imbalance from across the way as

1407
01:12:18,880 --> 01:12:21,600
well as well as the swing points this is

1408
01:12:21,600 --> 01:12:25,400
the last low this is the last High

1409
01:12:25,400 --> 01:12:28,440
so price can go all the way up into this

1410
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:30,120
swing point and leave but price can

1411
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:31,920
reject out of here too this imbalance

1412
01:12:31,920 --> 01:12:34,560
right here and take us back down why

1413
01:12:34,560 --> 01:12:36,320
because this imbalance was untapped we

1414
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:39,520
just tapped it here this imbalance was

1415
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,760
untapped and not just that the imbalance

1416
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:46,400
is untapped but within the range of this

1417
01:12:46,400 --> 01:12:50,159
and this did this already tap into any

1418
01:12:50,159 --> 01:12:53,280
premium levels uh no it didn't so maybe

1419
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,840
this this could continue up there a

1420
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,120
possibility no premium levels within

1421
01:12:59,120 --> 01:13:00,080
here

1422
01:13:00,080 --> 01:13:02,520
yet we'll

1423
01:13:02,520 --> 01:13:06,199
see but we got the imbalance T that's

1424
01:13:06,199 --> 01:13:09,080
why I say that you don't forecast longer

1425
01:13:09,080 --> 01:13:12,320
than then immediately where you are you

1426
01:13:12,320 --> 01:13:14,560
don't forecast longer than

1427
01:13:14,560 --> 01:13:18,320
that because look we got the tap with a

1428
01:13:18,320 --> 01:13:21,440
scalp coming

1429
01:13:21,440 --> 01:13:24,840
down 19 pip scalp coming down now we

1430
01:13:24,840 --> 01:13:26,360
could be looking to take the high and we

1431
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:28,760
have another imbalance above so let's

1432
01:13:28,760 --> 01:13:30,239
just watch this and see what could

1433
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:32,320
potentially happen could it be a

1434
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:36,600
Candlestick formation of a um double top

1435
01:13:36,600 --> 01:13:38,960
here yeah that's true that that could be

1436
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:43,560
possible because look we have this

1437
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:47,560
here and we have this snd Zone above so

1438
01:13:47,560 --> 01:13:51,600
let's see if it runs this

1439
01:13:52,360 --> 01:13:55,360
low

1440
01:13:56,560 --> 01:13:58,639
cuz usually the Run of this

1441
01:13:58,639 --> 01:14:01,320
low would cause us to push down give us

1442
01:14:01,320 --> 01:14:03,719
a retracement back up into the area give

1443
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:08,800
us a double top up inside of an snd Zone

1444
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:11,600
here and then potentially shorting out

1445
01:14:11,600 --> 01:14:16,800
to run the lows that could potentially

1446
01:14:22,280 --> 01:14:24,180
happen

1447
01:14:24,180 --> 01:14:27,439
[Music]

1448
01:14:34,840 --> 01:14:38,239
do we have any imbalances in

1449
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:41,639
here you would think that my whole

1450
01:14:41,639 --> 01:14:44,520
system was based on

1451
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:47,520
um imbalances because how much I talk

1452
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:48,719
about

1453
01:14:48,719 --> 01:14:52,159
them uh but it's not it's actually just

1454
01:14:52,159 --> 01:14:55,440
based on the the

1455
01:14:59,880 --> 01:15:02,719
algorithm I kind of like this song has a

1456
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:06,280
nice little jingle to

1457
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:10,520
it I don't know what it's saying

1458
01:15:18,840 --> 01:15:21,239
but I kind of like house and edum a

1459
01:15:21,239 --> 01:15:22,920
little so a lot of people were bad

1460
01:15:22,920 --> 01:15:26,040
talking um the Drake album we trashing

1461
01:15:26,040 --> 01:15:28,080
it watch we got an area up here guys so

1462
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:29,719
just be careful of that a lot of people

1463
01:15:29,719 --> 01:15:33,159
were back talking the um the Drake album

1464
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:36,239
um and I mean it's it's clearly just a

1465
01:15:36,239 --> 01:15:39,159
house album um house music um a lot of

1466
01:15:39,159 --> 01:15:40,480
people who don't listen to house music

1467
01:15:40,480 --> 01:15:41,400
won't

1468
01:15:41,400 --> 01:15:43,840
really understand how like that that

1469
01:15:43,840 --> 01:15:45,719
album was a masterpiece most people said

1470
01:15:45,719 --> 01:15:47,400
it's garbage because they expect it

1471
01:15:47,400 --> 01:15:50,000
rapping I mean I don't listen to rap but

1472
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,199
you know they expected rap rapping

1473
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:55,120
coming from it and

1474
01:15:55,120 --> 01:15:57,480
um you know which which is

1475
01:15:57,480 --> 01:16:00,639
understandable if if it's his flow it's

1476
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:05,760
usually what his fan base May um want

1477
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,080
you know in particular so that that

1478
01:16:08,080 --> 01:16:10,760
makes some pretty good sense um this is

1479
01:16:10,760 --> 01:16:15,520
the last unmitigated area above up

1480
01:16:16,040 --> 01:16:18,480
here so you just want to make sure that

1481
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:20,280
it doesn't come above this if it comes

1482
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,480
above this area then it's going to

1483
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:25,679
Target some of the highs but this could

1484
01:16:25,679 --> 01:16:28,920
very well just be the retracement back

1485
01:16:28,920 --> 01:16:32,159
down into somewhere within here and then

1486
01:16:32,159 --> 01:16:36,520
we end up pushing out to the highs if

1487
01:16:36,520 --> 01:16:39,159
this does retrace back down so that

1488
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:42,960
would make this little low here fair

1489
01:16:42,960 --> 01:16:46,560
game price would just run that

1490
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:50,120
low uh let me

1491
01:16:50,120 --> 01:16:53,199
see there another oh no there's no

1492
01:16:53,199 --> 01:16:55,520
balance here you see both of them touch

1493
01:16:55,520 --> 01:16:56,360
each

1494
01:16:56,360 --> 01:16:59,239
other this Wick touches this Wick even

1495
01:16:59,239 --> 01:17:01,400
if it extended down lower into this Weck

1496
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,400
that's fine it's still a

1497
01:17:05,719 --> 01:17:08,719
f but there's

1498
01:17:08,719 --> 01:17:11,239
potentially an unmitigated area

1499
01:17:11,239 --> 01:17:14,159
somewhere within

1500
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,880
here within

1501
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:22,000
here but remember you do have this

1502
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,000
imbalance

1503
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,280
directly

1504
01:17:26,280 --> 01:17:29,080
above so you could have a short into

1505
01:17:29,080 --> 01:17:31,719
this area and then it Springs off of the

1506
01:17:31,719 --> 01:17:34,639
imbalance or it could end up coming down

1507
01:17:34,639 --> 01:17:36,840
into the unmitigated area and springing

1508
01:17:36,840 --> 01:17:39,080
off of that but it could spring off of

1509
01:17:39,080 --> 01:17:41,800
that give us equal highs up here and

1510
01:17:41,800 --> 01:17:45,600
still end up coming back down to run the

1511
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:54,679
low

1512
01:17:54,679 --> 01:17:59,400
so this top was the top of this snd

1513
01:18:03,239 --> 01:18:06,080
here right here you see the Candlestick

1514
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:08,560
pattern

1515
01:18:09,040 --> 01:18:12,679
here that we like to

1516
01:18:13,159 --> 01:18:15,280
see I tell people I don't say these

1517
01:18:15,280 --> 01:18:16,960
things for my health or try to like

1518
01:18:16,960 --> 01:18:19,719
sound good with it or you know like yeah

1519
01:18:19,719 --> 01:18:23,400
to Sauce I'm nice you know like I'm I I

1520
01:18:23,400 --> 01:18:26,840
don't like I don't need to I because if

1521
01:18:26,840 --> 01:18:28,639
I had to do that every time this

1522
01:18:28,639 --> 01:18:30,679
happened I'd be doing that the whole

1523
01:18:30,679 --> 01:18:33,880
stream you know CU this happens all the

1524
01:18:33,880 --> 01:18:35,840
time little Candlestick pattern I said

1525
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:37,560
I'd like to see it gives me some

1526
01:18:37,560 --> 01:18:40,360
confidence that I'm in the right move is

1527
01:18:40,360 --> 01:18:42,840
there you know and this Candlestick

1528
01:18:42,840 --> 01:18:45,760
pattern here is just this larger chart

1529
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,320
pattern here on the higher time frame

1530
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:49,480
this Candlestick pattern is just

1531
01:18:49,480 --> 01:18:54,080
happening on on like a um one second or

1532
01:18:54,080 --> 01:18:56,320
something so look we tapped into this

1533
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:01,400
snd here down below we got to push back

1534
01:19:01,400 --> 01:19:04,239
up are we just tapping into this area to

1535
01:19:04,239 --> 01:19:06,000
continue rejecting or are we coming

1536
01:19:06,000 --> 01:19:08,400
above it to actually run it and go up

1537
01:19:08,400 --> 01:19:12,400
into some of these highs we'll

1538
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:15,440
see I mean this snd here was responsible

1539
01:19:15,440 --> 01:19:17,320
for this structural break above so

1540
01:19:17,320 --> 01:19:19,360
that's what probably why we tapped into

1541
01:19:19,360 --> 01:19:21,520
it and then we started to trade

1542
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:23,960
higher but all of these different things

1543
01:19:23,960 --> 01:19:26,840
if you spot these things in real time

1544
01:19:26,840 --> 01:19:31,000
it's so so easy for you guys

1545
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:33,840
to you know be able to trade off of it

1546
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:37,040
like there there has to be like like a a

1547
01:19:37,040 --> 01:19:41,080
ton of Pips that we call all within like

1548
01:19:41,080 --> 01:19:44,000
all of this like coming down there has

1549
01:19:44,000 --> 01:19:46,320
to be a ton of it we talked about this

1550
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,560
imbalance I mean this this area being

1551
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:51,040
tapped and this was the last area that

1552
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:54,520
price was in before it began to fall out

1553
01:19:54,520 --> 01:19:56,080
and look at this all the way down if you

1554
01:19:56,080 --> 01:20:02,040
held it this is 392 Pips in hour and a

1555
01:20:02,040 --> 01:20:04,639
half so if you were just on a measly one

1556
01:20:04,639 --> 01:20:06,560
lot size which let me not say measly

1557
01:20:06,560 --> 01:20:08,199
because it could come off as judgment to

1558
01:20:08,199 --> 01:20:09,600
other people but if you were just in on

1559
01:20:09,600 --> 01:20:13,560
a one lot size and you got the tap from

1560
01:20:13,560 --> 01:20:14,920
up there and you just held it all

1561
01:20:14,920 --> 01:20:16,040
throughout the stream while we were

1562
01:20:16,040 --> 01:20:17,800
talking at no point did we give an

1563
01:20:17,800 --> 01:20:19,480
indication that price will reverse and

1564
01:20:19,480 --> 01:20:21,560
go for any of the highs we even went

1565
01:20:21,560 --> 01:20:23,920
back and showed how it was possible that

1566
01:20:23,920 --> 01:20:25,800
would be bearish over the next couple of

1567
01:20:25,800 --> 01:20:29,080
days or so potentially you know because

1568
01:20:29,080 --> 01:20:30,600
price can change at any point Anything

1569
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,440
Could Happen um but we mentioned that

1570
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,360
that could

1571
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:37,280
happen and that was just from up in this

1572
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:41,080
area when when we finally got the stuff

1573
01:20:41,080 --> 01:20:43,080
going within the stream and stuff like

1574
01:20:43,080 --> 01:20:46,280
that we had this tap coming down so we

1575
01:20:46,280 --> 01:20:48,800
had price trading to this area because

1576
01:20:48,800 --> 01:20:50,840
we said if we ran this High we would tug

1577
01:20:50,840 --> 01:20:53,239
back into this area and then go long

1578
01:20:53,239 --> 01:20:55,480
so we had a long into a

1579
01:20:55,480 --> 01:20:58,440
short and we've been shorting ever since

1580
01:20:58,440 --> 01:20:59,800
which we said that we were bearish

1581
01:20:59,800 --> 01:21:01,600
overall but we were finding things

1582
01:21:01,600 --> 01:21:04,320
within here that were tradable so we did

1583
01:21:04,320 --> 01:21:06,280
find this imbalance that it tapped into

1584
01:21:06,280 --> 01:21:08,080
we got a rejection away from

1585
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:11,400
it at this top let's say if you got in

1586
01:21:11,400 --> 01:21:14,080
on this imbalance price tapped

1587
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:17,080
here and price took you all the way 154

1588
01:21:17,080 --> 01:21:18,520
Pips in 30 minutes just on that

1589
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:19,920
imbalance

1590
01:21:19,920 --> 01:21:22,520
alone we're noting the little imbalances

1591
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:25,239
that are here but we also like the

1592
01:21:25,239 --> 01:21:28,440
strong rejections away that's what we

1593
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:31,159
want to see when it comes to the type of

1594
01:21:31,159 --> 01:21:33,679
imbalances we want to see a strong

1595
01:21:33,679 --> 01:21:35,520
rejection

1596
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,280
away and that gives us that confidence

1597
01:21:38,280 --> 01:21:42,800
that prices moving out of that

1598
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,000
area but again the first tap is the

1599
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:54,639
scalp the second tap is the longer move

1600
01:21:58,310 --> 01:22:01,389
[Music]

1601
01:22:11,080 --> 01:22:15,400
all right me and my measly one

1602
01:22:15,600 --> 01:22:17,840
last you know you you're going to be

1603
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:21,840
trading 400 500 Lots 1,000 Lots soon so

1604
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:24,080
don't even worry about

1605
01:22:24,080 --> 01:22:27,360
it I mean I started

1606
01:22:27,360 --> 01:22:30,000
um I've never used anything you know

1607
01:22:30,000 --> 01:22:31,440
what's so interesting about that I've

1608
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:33,280
never used anything lower than a one

1609
01:22:33,280 --> 01:22:34,880
even when I was losing I was still using

1610
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,120
a one i' never used anything lower than

1611
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:39,520
a one then I was like let me see about a

1612
01:22:39,520 --> 01:22:41,800
five and then let me see about a 10 and

1613
01:22:41,800 --> 01:22:43,719
then let me see about a 40 and then let

1614
01:22:43,719 --> 01:22:47,360
me see about a 100 and see how 400 moves

1615
01:22:47,360 --> 01:22:50,360
and and I'm like oh this is beautiful

1616
01:22:50,360 --> 01:22:53,639
great wonderful

1617
01:22:53,639 --> 01:22:55,400
so look we just took this High to the

1618
01:22:55,400 --> 01:22:58,639
left right here we just grabbed the high

1619
01:22:58,639 --> 01:23:01,000
that was

1620
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:15,080
here let's see what this

1621
01:23:15,080 --> 01:23:18,480
does let me go back to any of

1622
01:23:18,480 --> 01:23:21,480
these things here this

1623
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,480
is

1624
01:23:33,400 --> 01:23:36,679
gold so gold didn't give us another high

1625
01:23:36,679 --> 01:23:39,280
after tapping into this area

1626
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:43,520
here we tapped in we left and we're

1627
01:23:43,520 --> 01:23:47,320
returning back to it

1628
01:23:47,320 --> 01:23:51,480
um because we didn't put in another

1629
01:23:51,480 --> 01:23:54,480
high

1630
01:23:58,800 --> 01:24:02,199
oh but we also didn't run the

1631
01:24:02,199 --> 01:24:06,719
low so go could be coming

1632
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,480
here or this could be

1633
01:24:17,480 --> 01:24:20,320
where where it's reversing from if you

1634
01:24:20,320 --> 01:24:22,920
incorporate this high this whole range

1635
01:24:22,920 --> 01:24:24,960
here could be tapping into this and

1636
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:27,080
going but there's also this little

1637
01:24:27,080 --> 01:24:28,639
imbalance in

1638
01:24:28,639 --> 01:24:30,880
here imbalance imbalance IM balance

1639
01:24:30,880 --> 01:24:31,880
imbalance IM balance IM balance

1640
01:24:31,880 --> 01:24:33,600
imbalance IM balance IM balance you see

1641
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:34,920
how you could have thought that it was

1642
01:24:34,920 --> 01:24:38,880
going down to this area here but when

1643
01:24:38,880 --> 01:24:41,000
you actually factored in the

1644
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:45,199
imbalance we got to tap here so we get a

1645
01:24:45,199 --> 01:24:48,440
scalp up from the

1646
01:24:50,080 --> 01:24:54,320
imbalance right here

1647
01:24:54,320 --> 01:24:58,199
this is a 144 pip scalp up usually the

1648
01:24:58,199 --> 01:25:03,080
TP of some streamers with your trades um

1649
01:25:03,080 --> 01:25:05,520
and then you can get a run of this

1650
01:25:05,520 --> 01:25:08,320
low and then or price can sideways

1651
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,360
consolidate within this area as well but

1652
01:25:11,360 --> 01:25:13,199
we could also still make it down to here

1653
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:14,719
realistically speaking I don't want to

1654
01:25:14,719 --> 01:25:17,199
mislead you guys to make you think that

1655
01:25:17,199 --> 01:25:20,239
we're ultimately not coming down here

1656
01:25:20,239 --> 01:25:22,040
there is a a possibility that we come

1657
01:25:22,040 --> 01:25:23,600
down into this

1658
01:25:23,600 --> 01:25:26,600
area

1659
01:25:27,920 --> 01:25:30,360
here so we end up running a low may not

1660
01:25:30,360 --> 01:25:32,760
find support then we'll end up running

1661
01:25:32,760 --> 01:25:35,760
through the imbalance

1662
01:25:36,360 --> 01:25:39,360
to

1663
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:51,280
here so we're either going to here for

1664
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:56,280
gold 126 or 124 possibility if we end up

1665
01:25:56,280 --> 01:25:59,520
running through um this imbalance here

1666
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,800
but you probably just want to find

1667
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:02,320
something on

1668
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:04,920
the the higher time frame that could

1669
01:26:04,920 --> 01:26:07,440
potentially facilitate the low back down

1670
01:26:07,440 --> 01:26:11,639
and that might have been this imbalance

1671
01:26:15,639 --> 01:26:19,880
here and what often time um support and

1672
01:26:19,880 --> 01:26:24,199
resistance Traders are seeing is this

1673
01:26:25,159 --> 01:26:27,360
so they utilize this and if price comes

1674
01:26:27,360 --> 01:26:29,520
back up here again and gets rejected

1675
01:26:29,520 --> 01:26:32,679
they'll take the short out of this area

1676
01:26:32,679 --> 01:26:34,639
but there's no real

1677
01:26:34,639 --> 01:26:37,840
principles you know within this other

1678
01:26:37,840 --> 01:26:39,760
than I know ICT teaches something called

1679
01:26:39,760 --> 01:26:42,320
the breaker block or something like that

1680
01:26:42,320 --> 01:26:45,400
where price trades below it Taps back up

1681
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:49,280
into it and then rejects away um I've

1682
01:26:49,280 --> 01:26:51,800
seen that happen I've seen it not happen

1683
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:54,679
it's just just not as accurate for me to

1684
01:26:54,679 --> 01:26:58,159
um put it in my trading style at all so

1685
01:26:58,159 --> 01:26:59,880
yeah no I

1686
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:03,600
wouldn't I wouldn't do

1687
01:27:12,840 --> 01:27:16,320
that so we tapped into this snd below

1688
01:27:16,320 --> 01:27:19,080
and we traded

1689
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:23,920
higher within here

1690
01:27:23,920 --> 01:27:26,679
we tapped into this and put in another

1691
01:27:26,679 --> 01:27:28,639
high remember that we have this

1692
01:27:28,639 --> 01:27:31,280
imbalance

1693
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:48,320
here see look even when we got our equal

1694
01:27:48,320 --> 01:27:51,320
High here even if you were shorting from

1695
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:53,080
here

1696
01:27:53,080 --> 01:27:57,320
short to the next zone or the next

1697
01:27:57,320 --> 01:28:00,000
fractal or the next

1698
01:28:00,000 --> 01:28:02,679
imbalance short to that let that be your

1699
01:28:02,679 --> 01:28:04,600
take profit for

1700
01:28:04,600 --> 01:28:07,159
scalping for

1701
01:28:07,159 --> 01:28:12,080
scalping if you get the second entry to

1702
01:28:12,080 --> 01:28:14,199
take it for a longer trade still

1703
01:28:14,199 --> 01:28:16,320
consider the zones if you see these huge

1704
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,239
Wick rejections that's enough for you to

1705
01:28:19,239 --> 01:28:21,040
to get

1706
01:28:21,040 --> 01:28:23,800
out you know to

1707
01:28:23,800 --> 01:28:27,159
to let me

1708
01:28:31,840 --> 01:28:34,840
see so we put in this low we took this

1709
01:28:34,840 --> 01:28:39,000
High we could be coming back

1710
01:28:43,480 --> 01:28:46,840
to maybe top here or further

1711
01:28:46,840 --> 01:28:48,719
below and

1712
01:28:48,719 --> 01:28:51,119
then further up to the imbalance

1713
01:28:51,119 --> 01:28:54,600
possibly hold

1714
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,920
on

1715
01:30:45,560 --> 01:30:47,040
sorry about that

1716
01:30:47,040 --> 01:30:48,960
guys

1717
01:30:48,960 --> 01:30:52,960
um you see these Wicks how they act as

1718
01:30:52,960 --> 01:30:55,000
zon sometimes that you could potentially

1719
01:30:55,000 --> 01:30:57,800
get rejections from mind you this watch

1720
01:30:57,800 --> 01:30:59,360
this area cuz this could still be a

1721
01:30:59,360 --> 01:31:01,239
double bottom within this area to go and

1722
01:31:01,239 --> 01:31:02,920
take the

1723
01:31:02,920 --> 01:31:05,719
high because this was an area

1724
01:31:05,719 --> 01:31:08,440
where there was an entry found on it but

1725
01:31:08,440 --> 01:31:10,800
I have mentioned to you guys um that you

1726
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:14,920
could tap into this area possibly and

1727
01:31:14,920 --> 01:31:16,800
then trade

1728
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:23,040
higher so we got the top uh let me

1729
01:31:23,040 --> 01:31:26,560
and then we got to tap again to the

1730
01:31:29,239 --> 01:31:33,440
top so scalp from here to here and then

1731
01:31:33,440 --> 01:31:35,040
from

1732
01:31:35,040 --> 01:31:38,679
here you also have an entry to come down

1733
01:31:38,679 --> 01:31:42,080
with this this candle that

1734
01:31:43,840 --> 01:31:49,199
touched to come down here and if we see

1735
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:52,880
that it's trading lower down to this snd

1736
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:54,840
this might be the area where you get out

1737
01:31:54,840 --> 01:31:58,880
get in and pay if it it just all depends

1738
01:31:58,880 --> 01:32:00,440
on your account size but let's say you

1739
01:32:00,440 --> 01:32:02,000
have an account size and you're scalping

1740
01:32:02,000 --> 01:32:05,159
with this this one scalp for me the tap

1741
01:32:05,159 --> 01:32:07,320
here to come down here that's

1742
01:32:07,320 --> 01:32:09,840
$2,400 on a low lot

1743
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:14,280
size and on a higher lot size that's

1744
01:32:14,280 --> 01:32:16,880
like 10

1745
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:20,159
15,000 and on my highest lot size this

1746
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:23,679
is this is like $25,000

1747
01:32:24,320 --> 01:32:25,800
just with a little scalp so it all

1748
01:32:25,800 --> 01:32:28,760
depends on your your um your lot size

1749
01:32:28,760 --> 01:32:30,920
and your account size but if you learn

1750
01:32:30,920 --> 01:32:33,280
the principles all together you could

1751
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:37,920
reproduce it at any size of your account

1752
01:32:37,920 --> 01:32:39,719
any size within your account you could

1753
01:32:39,719 --> 01:32:42,320
reproduce that so this may continue to

1754
01:32:42,320 --> 01:32:44,320
go up from here this may not be stopping

1755
01:32:44,320 --> 01:32:46,280
here um because we didn't get a run of

1756
01:32:46,280 --> 01:32:48,960
this low um here as of yet we did run

1757
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:52,040
this low which wait let me see this high

1758
01:32:52,040 --> 01:32:55,119
uh High 443 this high

1759
01:32:55,119 --> 01:32:57,719
is uh

1760
01:32:57,719 --> 01:33:00,719
443 so the Run of this low could be the

1761
01:33:00,719 --> 01:33:02,600
reason why this TAPS in and then this

1762
01:33:02,600 --> 01:33:05,400
could short the Run of this low here cuz

1763
01:33:05,400 --> 01:33:08,639
this low gave us the same

1764
01:33:09,400 --> 01:33:12,639
high so this could be a a pull out of

1765
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:14,520
the area maybe even to this imbalance

1766
01:33:14,520 --> 01:33:17,639
here make it a wick below this imbalance

1767
01:33:17,639 --> 01:33:20,280
and then and tap up but yeah we we named

1768
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:23,000
it a a market ERS because like I

1769
01:33:23,000 --> 01:33:25,560
mentioned like you know this is this is

1770
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,679
precision now you don't get to retail

1771
01:33:28,679 --> 01:33:31,920
trading there's no there's no

1772
01:33:31,920 --> 01:33:34,639
Precision you know if if that's $2 for

1773
01:33:34,639 --> 01:33:36,159
you you could actually use a 15minute

1774
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:38,520
time frame and make that 200 because

1775
01:33:38,520 --> 01:33:41,400
it'll be longer scalps scalps will be

1776
01:33:41,400 --> 01:33:45,320
longer moves um but uh you

1777
01:33:45,320 --> 01:33:47,960
know with your account size if you have

1778
01:33:47,960 --> 01:33:50,679
the same type of discipline over and

1779
01:33:50,679 --> 01:33:52,360
over and over again again with an

1780
01:33:52,360 --> 01:33:54,480
account size like this this could also

1781
01:33:54,480 --> 01:33:57,719
be coming down to this area here below

1782
01:33:57,719 --> 01:34:00,320
um cuz this is the snd that essentially

1783
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,639
broke structure to the top side but you

1784
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:04,080
have this imbalance you have this

1785
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:06,440
fractal here and then you have this snd

1786
01:34:06,440 --> 01:34:08,840
here so if it's shorting you want to

1787
01:34:08,840 --> 01:34:11,480
look at some of these areas if it's

1788
01:34:11,480 --> 01:34:14,199
shorting below these areas you want to

1789
01:34:14,199 --> 01:34:16,880
look at some of these areas down below

1790
01:34:16,880 --> 01:34:20,480
cuz this could be an snd within

1791
01:34:20,480 --> 01:34:23,480
here

1792
01:34:24,040 --> 01:34:26,239
this could be a snd within here and this

1793
01:34:26,239 --> 01:34:29,040
could be a double bottom within the snd

1794
01:34:29,040 --> 01:34:33,280
where price ended up trading back up so

1795
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,560
this could have been the first scalp

1796
01:34:34,560 --> 01:34:36,960
into the area back up this could be the

1797
01:34:36,960 --> 01:34:39,440
next touch into the area and then maybe

1798
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,920
take the highs possibility or just come

1799
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:46,119
to this snd above because this snd above

1800
01:34:46,119 --> 01:34:48,199
is not uh

1801
01:34:48,199 --> 01:34:50,480
mitigated it's not

1802
01:34:50,480 --> 01:34:53,119
mitigated

1803
01:34:53,119 --> 01:34:54,480
so we just be looking at that there's

1804
01:34:54,480 --> 01:34:56,600
this fractal here fractal here there's

1805
01:34:56,600 --> 01:34:59,239
this um imbalance here and then there's

1806
01:34:59,239 --> 01:35:02,800
a snd below here so we're looking to

1807
01:35:02,800 --> 01:35:05,159
potentially Target this area because

1808
01:35:05,159 --> 01:35:07,880
this area was responsible for this

1809
01:35:07,880 --> 01:35:10,239
structural break at the

1810
01:35:10,239 --> 01:35:12,760
top as well as this area is still

1811
01:35:12,760 --> 01:35:15,880
responsible for all of these breaking or

1812
01:35:15,880 --> 01:35:17,679
running these highs so you see what I

1813
01:35:17,679 --> 01:35:21,119
mentioned by trend lines how you know I

1814
01:35:21,119 --> 01:35:23,159
love the mention of the Cherry you got

1815
01:35:23,159 --> 01:35:24,719
me laughing too

1816
01:35:24,719 --> 01:35:27,239
much

1817
01:35:27,239 --> 01:35:29,600
Nicholas

1818
01:35:29,600 --> 01:35:33,000
yeah we TR $100 to $10,000 in donate to

1819
01:35:33,000 --> 01:35:34,679
charity while teaching us please the

1820
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:37,639
cherry on top so I'm I'm actually

1821
01:35:37,639 --> 01:35:40,320
looking to um to do that I want to take

1822
01:35:40,320 --> 01:35:41,960
a small account to a larger account and

1823
01:35:41,960 --> 01:35:45,000
I want to do it live and I want to do it

1824
01:35:45,000 --> 01:35:47,639
with a couple of people who have the

1825
01:35:47,639 --> 01:35:50,600
same amount of money and I want to be

1826
01:35:50,600 --> 01:35:52,080
able to

1827
01:35:52,080 --> 01:35:55,080
take everybody's account to a certain

1828
01:35:55,080 --> 01:35:59,080
level so the $600 marker is what I like

1829
01:35:59,080 --> 01:36:00,960
to start with because that's what I

1830
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:02,400
started with when I first started

1831
01:36:02,400 --> 01:36:04,800
trading but um you know you could even

1832
01:36:04,800 --> 01:36:06,880
do the 200 the 200 may take a little

1833
01:36:06,880 --> 01:36:08,920
longer than two weeks to do but if it

1834
01:36:08,920 --> 01:36:11,639
was 600 I could definitely get that 600

1835
01:36:11,639 --> 01:36:17,280
to to um uh 20,000 in in one week

1836
01:36:17,280 --> 01:36:20,119
definitely get it to 20,000 in one week

1837
01:36:20,119 --> 01:36:21,800
because look at this look at look at

1838
01:36:21,800 --> 01:36:23,400
look at these

1839
01:36:23,400 --> 01:36:26,040
entries that I

1840
01:36:26,040 --> 01:36:27,960
have

1841
01:36:27,960 --> 01:36:30,600
here let me make sure this isn't

1842
01:36:30,600 --> 01:36:32,880
copyrighted music before they flag My

1843
01:36:32,880 --> 01:36:35,239
Stream NOP it's

1844
01:36:35,239 --> 01:36:38,320
not um so

1845
01:36:38,320 --> 01:36:42,679
look we went from this imbalance here we

1846
01:36:42,679 --> 01:36:44,480
got our Candlestick pattern that we

1847
01:36:44,480 --> 01:36:47,040
usually like to see then we got a huge

1848
01:36:47,040 --> 01:36:49,320
mark down this was

1849
01:36:49,320 --> 01:36:51,960
here when

1850
01:36:51,960 --> 01:36:53,760
before price even got here price even

1851
01:36:53,760 --> 01:36:56,239
made this dip here and this was here

1852
01:36:56,239 --> 01:36:57,760
when price got here let's say I took

1853
01:36:57,760 --> 01:36:59,520
this trade from

1854
01:36:59,520 --> 01:37:02,360
here to here let's say I took it here

1855
01:37:02,360 --> 01:37:05,639
where I saw this flip happening it's 246

1856
01:37:05,639 --> 01:37:08,840
Pips on a one lot size oil is $10 per

1857
01:37:08,840 --> 01:37:14,040
pip so if you have 246 Pips $10 per Pip

1858
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,000
this is

1859
01:37:15,000 --> 01:37:21,320
2400 within one hour 2400 in one hour

1860
01:37:21,320 --> 01:37:24,040
using a $600

1861
01:37:24,040 --> 01:37:27,159
account in one hour so yeah if it's $300

1862
01:37:27,159 --> 01:37:28,600
then you can take it to$ 10,000

1863
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:30,600
definitely but either way this is still

1864
01:37:30,600 --> 01:37:33,600
one hour now granted people like why are

1865
01:37:33,600 --> 01:37:35,960
you using a one lot size with that much

1866
01:37:35,960 --> 01:37:37,480
money in your account you could blow

1867
01:37:37,480 --> 01:37:39,239
your account blah blah no it's not

1868
01:37:39,239 --> 01:37:40,480
blowing my account because I know what

1869
01:37:40,480 --> 01:37:43,599
I'm doing other people don't so yes I'm

1870
01:37:43,599 --> 01:37:46,880
I'm very precise if I lose in this trade

1871
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:48,719
I'm losing

1872
01:37:48,719 --> 01:37:52,960
like five Pips or something like that

1873
01:37:52,960 --> 01:37:54,360
and it could be five Pips because it

1874
01:37:54,360 --> 01:37:56,040
could be coming to tap this imbalance

1875
01:37:56,040 --> 01:37:59,800
back here so I might have got in too

1876
01:37:59,800 --> 01:38:01,719
early and it came up to tap this

1877
01:38:01,719 --> 01:38:04,440
imbalance and then traded away but look

1878
01:38:04,440 --> 01:38:06,800
at this price tapped this area tapped

1879
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:09,000
into this we fell we came back to this

1880
01:38:09,000 --> 01:38:10,599
imbalance what did we

1881
01:38:10,599 --> 01:38:14,080
get imbalance from the left side we came

1882
01:38:14,080 --> 01:38:16,199
back into this imbalance we got a double

1883
01:38:16,199 --> 01:38:18,639
top within our imbalance and then look

1884
01:38:18,639 --> 01:38:20,880
we push down to where the next imbalance

1885
01:38:20,880 --> 01:38:22,360
below

1886
01:38:22,360 --> 01:38:26,040
so another 2 hours later that's 150

1887
01:38:26,040 --> 01:38:29,199
Pips I'd be at $4,000

1888
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:32,400
already just noticing these I I show

1889
01:38:32,400 --> 01:38:34,280
these all the time to people these are

1890
01:38:34,280 --> 01:38:37,159
so easy to catch and then look we tap

1891
01:38:37,159 --> 01:38:38,760
into this imbalance here and what do we

1892
01:38:38,760 --> 01:38:41,960
do we run from this low we get a double

1893
01:38:41,960 --> 01:38:43,960
tap on our imbalance so let's let's talk

1894
01:38:43,960 --> 01:38:46,599
about the scalp first we get a 30 pip

1895
01:38:46,599 --> 01:38:49,960
scalp 390 bucks we get in on another

1896
01:38:49,960 --> 01:38:52,080
entry this pushes all the way up here

1897
01:38:52,080 --> 01:38:54,239
maybe I would have got out here if I saw

1898
01:38:54,239 --> 01:38:56,000
this huge push down then I saw this

1899
01:38:56,000 --> 01:38:57,520
retracing back up maybe I would have got

1900
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:00,560
out there look at that another 291 Pips

1901
01:39:00,560 --> 01:39:03,679
we'd already be at like

1902
01:39:04,119 --> 01:39:07,360
7500 just utilizing these little things

1903
01:39:07,360 --> 01:39:09,560
that I use to create these swing points

1904
01:39:09,560 --> 01:39:12,119
little tiny things and I could I could

1905
01:39:12,119 --> 01:39:14,360
trade all of this within here too all of

1906
01:39:14,360 --> 01:39:15,840
this all of this through here I could

1907
01:39:15,840 --> 01:39:18,040
trade all of that too so it's it's

1908
01:39:18,040 --> 01:39:22,320
really really really easy really easy

1909
01:39:22,320 --> 01:39:26,679
easy they forgot about the E the EA da

1910
01:39:26,679 --> 01:39:27,880
that's what I'm saying I definitely want

1911
01:39:27,880 --> 01:39:29,360
to look into the social trading but the

1912
01:39:29,360 --> 01:39:32,320
social trading has high spreads and high

1913
01:39:32,320 --> 01:39:34,320
commissions so that's the issue with

1914
01:39:34,320 --> 01:39:37,400
that social trading is cool but now you

1915
01:39:37,400 --> 01:39:39,320
have to trade from a higher time frame

1916
01:39:39,320 --> 01:39:40,920
just to make that even

1917
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,679
work are you guys been writing in the

1918
01:39:43,679 --> 01:39:47,280
chat uh let's

1919
01:39:48,480 --> 01:39:52,480
see this says Sean on the cell

1920
01:39:52,480 --> 01:39:54,880
this is

1921
01:39:56,199 --> 01:39:59,159
NZ uh this

1922
01:39:59,159 --> 01:40:04,880
is uh Euro USD is

1923
01:40:05,280 --> 01:40:08,920
it bearus OT I hear people use that that

1924
01:40:08,920 --> 01:40:11,400
OT what what is that OT I I really don't

1925
01:40:11,400 --> 01:40:12,440
know what that

1926
01:40:12,440 --> 01:40:15,320
is um but I see uh there's this guy

1927
01:40:15,320 --> 01:40:17,560
named the OT Trader on YouTube I see him

1928
01:40:17,560 --> 01:40:19,599
use OT all the time I just don't know

1929
01:40:19,599 --> 01:40:21,520
exactly what that is

1930
01:40:21,520 --> 01:40:24,040
waiting for a bearish flip to play out

1931
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:28,760
okay yeah that's cuz we flipped

1932
01:40:28,760 --> 01:40:33,080
below we had the stab put in we have the

1933
01:40:33,080 --> 01:40:34,639
left side even though it's shorter we

1934
01:40:34,639 --> 01:40:36,679
have the right side we could potentially

1935
01:40:36,679 --> 01:40:41,639
tap into that bearish um the 15minute uh

1936
01:40:41,639 --> 01:40:45,080
imbalance that's there um but we no we

1937
01:40:45,080 --> 01:40:46,719
got the we already tagged the imbalance

1938
01:40:46,719 --> 01:40:48,400
up top so that's cool so yeah we could

1939
01:40:48,400 --> 01:40:49,679
tag into that imbalance and then

1940
01:40:49,679 --> 01:40:54,280
continue down let's true um on the one

1941
01:40:54,280 --> 01:40:56,520
minute okay oh you don't have us30 you

1942
01:40:56,520 --> 01:40:58,960
might be using a regulat broker then um

1943
01:40:58,960 --> 01:41:00,560
we're going to find a way to help you

1944
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,119
get to the the other broker um that has

1945
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:06,639
us30 because it's so perfect no indices

1946
01:41:06,639 --> 01:41:08,960
at all and the Leever oh The Leverage is

1947
01:41:08,960 --> 01:41:11,520
1 to 1,000

1948
01:41:11,520 --> 01:41:13,320
oo

1949
01:41:13,320 --> 01:41:16,480
damn what what broker you have y'all got

1950
01:41:16,480 --> 01:41:18,239
any more of

1951
01:41:18,239 --> 01:41:21,480
those one to 1,000

1952
01:41:21,480 --> 01:41:24,320
yo I'd be making a million dollars a day

1953
01:41:24,320 --> 01:41:26,520
if I had that

1954
01:41:26,520 --> 01:41:29,840
leverage H looks like it hit the level

1955
01:41:29,840 --> 01:41:32,199
oh looks like it hit his 15minute level

1956
01:41:32,199 --> 01:41:34,840
let's check that

1957
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:44,000
out uh where was

1958
01:41:44,000 --> 01:41:48,840
this so was this tap into this area we

1959
01:41:48,840 --> 01:41:52,840
did hit this snd

1960
01:41:53,000 --> 01:41:56,040
above um wait is that the oh that's the

1961
01:41:56,040 --> 01:41:58,960
one minute I think he

1962
01:42:02,239 --> 01:42:04,920
said is it the one minute or am I

1963
01:42:04,920 --> 01:42:07,639
tripping see look at this I said that

1964
01:42:07,639 --> 01:42:09,400
anytime there's a double

1965
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:11,760
top a double top in the area if you just

1966
01:42:11,760 --> 01:42:13,520
take a square and put it around a double

1967
01:42:13,520 --> 01:42:15,960
top look price comes back Taps into it

1968
01:42:15,960 --> 01:42:18,199
gives you a short I had mentioned that

1969
01:42:18,199 --> 01:42:19,760
on stream

1970
01:42:19,760 --> 01:42:22,719
yesterday price tabs here K9 give you a

1971
01:42:22,719 --> 01:42:25,360
short of 12 Pips and then kept shorting

1972
01:42:25,360 --> 01:42:28,239
down but usually it's if you put a

1973
01:42:28,239 --> 01:42:29,960
square around the double top that

1974
01:42:29,960 --> 01:42:33,040
happens usually get that that tap you

1975
01:42:33,040 --> 01:42:36,000
put it around the first low I mean the

1976
01:42:36,000 --> 01:42:38,719
the the most recent low after it leaves

1977
01:42:38,719 --> 01:42:41,040
the area entirely and you just cover the

1978
01:42:41,040 --> 01:42:43,639
highs and Bam you get to tap right into

1979
01:42:43,639 --> 01:42:45,679
the area and a

1980
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:48,920
short so yeah it's it's

1981
01:42:48,920 --> 01:42:52,159
uh yeah it's

1982
01:42:52,159 --> 01:42:55,719
sauce oh let me actually see though um

1983
01:42:55,719 --> 01:42:57,040
it was just a

1984
01:42:57,040 --> 01:43:00,360
fib optimal trade entry okay I need to

1985
01:43:00,360 --> 01:43:04,480
good broker my leverage one to

1986
01:43:04,560 --> 01:43:07,560
3,000

1987
01:43:08,440 --> 01:43:12,480
what yo I'd be so filthy rich with that

1988
01:43:12,480 --> 01:43:14,280
type of Leverage

1989
01:43:14,280 --> 01:43:17,920
man um what what oh let me let me just

1990
01:43:17,920 --> 01:43:22,679
look back at the 15 again

1991
01:43:23,719 --> 01:43:25,840
so this

1992
01:43:25,840 --> 01:43:28,239
is

1993
01:43:28,239 --> 01:43:31,679
1300 on the

1994
01:43:37,960 --> 01:43:40,960
15

1995
01:43:49,000 --> 01:43:53,400
so oh I time zones are

1996
01:43:53,400 --> 01:43:58,040
different uh Ryan what what time are you

1997
01:43:58,040 --> 01:44:02,599
in yeah our time zones are different

1998
01:44:02,599 --> 01:44:05,400
um let me

1999
01:44:05,400 --> 01:44:09,760
see oh this is the area that so that the

2000
01:44:09,760 --> 01:44:15,679
the OT Trader um he usually has this

2001
01:44:15,679 --> 01:44:19,599
this area marked out like

2002
01:44:19,599 --> 01:44:22,119
that yeah he usually has this area

2003
01:44:22,119 --> 01:44:23,920
marked

2004
01:44:23,920 --> 01:44:27,679
out um yeah this this could be

2005
01:44:27,679 --> 01:44:30,880
accumulation happening um with wof on

2006
01:44:30,880 --> 01:44:34,880
the 4H hour just to have um a

2007
01:44:34,880 --> 01:44:37,480
markup and potentially go to tag some of

2008
01:44:37,480 --> 01:44:39,280
the

2009
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:43,800
highs but I think this is the area here

2010
01:44:43,800 --> 01:44:47,880
that we were more so

2011
01:44:47,880 --> 01:44:50,560
yeah yeah so this this could be that too

2012
01:44:50,560 --> 01:44:52,960
to to in turn try to get back up to some

2013
01:44:52,960 --> 01:44:55,040
of these highs possibly within this area

2014
01:44:55,040 --> 01:44:56,400
or

2015
01:44:56,400 --> 01:44:58,639
that but watch it because we could have

2016
01:44:58,639 --> 01:45:01,440
a run of this trend line low and the

2017
01:45:01,440 --> 01:45:04,639
real move could be down within here let

2018
01:45:04,639 --> 01:45:06,159
me change this music because I don't

2019
01:45:06,159 --> 01:45:08,800
know what this Piano Man is trying to

2020
01:45:08,800 --> 01:45:11,239
do so yeah we could we could potentially

2021
01:45:11,239 --> 01:45:14,320
have that um yeah that's that's a hell

2022
01:45:14,320 --> 01:45:16,840
of a lot of Leverage it's like wow

2023
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:19,440
stopped it a bit early at an imbalance

2024
01:45:19,440 --> 01:45:20,880
won't enter it until it has the

2025
01:45:20,880 --> 01:45:22,320
imbalance

2026
01:45:22,320 --> 01:45:24,080
at

2027
01:45:24,080 --> 01:45:26,960
0258

2028
01:45:26,960 --> 01:45:31,840
0528 yeah okay so the the

2029
01:45:31,840 --> 01:45:35,320
052 8

2030
01:45:36,679 --> 01:45:41,280
imbalance uh within here okay that makes

2031
01:45:42,080 --> 01:45:45,440
sense yeah that that makes a lot of

2032
01:45:45,440 --> 01:45:48,320
sense um up within this area and a lot

2033
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:51,080
of times that can just grab a high

2034
01:45:51,080 --> 01:45:53,440
grab these highs cuz this is still trend

2035
01:45:53,440 --> 01:45:56,040
line as

2036
01:45:57,080 --> 01:45:59,599
well sometimes it could be just to go up

2037
01:45:59,599 --> 01:46:04,440
and grab the highs grab these highs and

2038
01:46:04,440 --> 01:46:07,840
then short back down below to

2039
01:46:07,840 --> 01:46:10,159
potentially the real move that's down

2040
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:13,440
there and then it takes you up so it can

2041
01:46:13,440 --> 01:46:15,440
just pretty much do that just push back

2042
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:17,960
up to this area reject from it and then

2043
01:46:17,960 --> 01:46:21,159
run the lows because you have trend line

2044
01:46:21,159 --> 01:46:23,960
lows here too so you could expect those

2045
01:46:23,960 --> 01:46:25,920
lows to be ran along with these equal

2046
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:27,960
lows that are around here so the real

2047
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:30,199
move may be further within this

2048
01:46:30,199 --> 01:46:34,480
area um just a little heads

2049
01:46:43,159 --> 01:46:46,800
up so I'm lost what did we mention about

2050
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:50,719
this area we mentioned it IM balance tap

2051
01:46:50,719 --> 01:46:52,760
oh this is the double bottom on the

2052
01:46:52,760 --> 01:46:55,599
imbalance to the left right

2053
01:46:55,599 --> 01:46:57,800
here yeah you see what I'm saying about

2054
01:46:57,800 --> 01:47:00,560
imbalances guys like super super

2055
01:47:00,560 --> 01:47:03,199
important we rejected out of this area

2056
01:47:03,199 --> 01:47:05,560
we tapped this imbalance we came back up

2057
01:47:05,560 --> 01:47:08,679
to this area rejected out of this area

2058
01:47:08,679 --> 01:47:10,800
could have taken a short from this area

2059
01:47:10,800 --> 01:47:12,719
back down to the imbalance because it

2060
01:47:12,719 --> 01:47:15,679
could potentially be a second top within

2061
01:47:15,679 --> 01:47:18,639
there or a equal you know low or or a

2062
01:47:18,639 --> 01:47:21,040
double bottom within this area so we get

2063
01:47:21,040 --> 01:47:23,760
that we get the double bottom on the

2064
01:47:23,760 --> 01:47:25,800
imbalance for the body but we also get

2065
01:47:25,800 --> 01:47:28,360
the double bottom here

2066
01:47:28,360 --> 01:47:30,280
within this

2067
01:47:30,280 --> 01:47:33,000
area

2068
01:47:33,000 --> 01:47:35,719
sorry we get the double bottom in this

2069
01:47:35,719 --> 01:47:40,080
snd Zone Bam Bam we run out of it where

2070
01:47:40,080 --> 01:47:45,199
do we top up into here this

2071
01:47:45,520 --> 01:47:50,000
here but we also got imbalan Taps here

2072
01:47:50,000 --> 01:47:52,480
with in this area that facilitated this

2073
01:47:52,480 --> 01:47:55,320
push back down to the double bottom and

2074
01:47:55,320 --> 01:47:57,840
then the double bottom gave us the push

2075
01:47:57,840 --> 01:48:02,400
back up to this particular area here now

2076
01:48:02,400 --> 01:48:05,159
if this doesn't run this because the

2077
01:48:05,159 --> 01:48:08,440
double bottom can stop

2078
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:14,520
here make sure there's no imbalances

2079
01:48:14,520 --> 01:48:18,400
under here there is a slight imbalance

2080
01:48:19,239 --> 01:48:22,239
here

2081
01:48:30,080 --> 01:48:34,960
look at that look at that look at that

2082
01:48:34,960 --> 01:48:38,440
no look at

2083
01:48:38,440 --> 01:48:42,480
that look at that

2084
01:48:44,520 --> 01:48:47,960
like look at

2085
01:48:49,199 --> 01:48:52,199
this

2086
01:48:56,400 --> 01:48:57,880
we could still run this High being that

2087
01:48:57,880 --> 01:48:59,840
we ran the

2088
01:48:59,840 --> 01:49:02,360
low but if not then this is a rejection

2089
01:49:02,360 --> 01:49:04,280
here to potentially come back down but

2090
01:49:04,280 --> 01:49:06,679
look what's left after we tapped into

2091
01:49:06,679 --> 01:49:08,520
this imbalance look what we left behind

2092
01:49:08,520 --> 01:49:10,679
this

2093
01:49:14,639 --> 01:49:16,880
Wick and all you're doing on the one

2094
01:49:16,880 --> 01:49:20,599
minute really is recreating zones oh you

2095
01:49:20,599 --> 01:49:23,599
use New York time okay so maybe my time

2096
01:49:23,599 --> 01:49:27,080
is wrong I'm see New

2097
01:49:27,080 --> 01:49:29,719
York

2098
01:49:29,719 --> 01:49:33,679
uh oh your your 1300 area was already

2099
01:49:33,679 --> 01:49:36,440
hit I didn't see that my bad so yeah it

2100
01:49:36,440 --> 01:49:38,880
is it is New York time my bad on

2101
01:49:38,880 --> 01:49:41,719
that but look at this imbalance how

2102
01:49:41,719 --> 01:49:44,599
mention we could still take this

2103
01:49:44,599 --> 01:49:46,800
High we take the high and what are we

2104
01:49:46,800 --> 01:49:48,760
tapping into are we tapping into this

2105
01:49:48,760 --> 01:49:52,119
area above that was left behind

2106
01:49:53,440 --> 01:49:56,880
oh we got the to of the front of

2107
01:49:59,840 --> 01:50:04,280
it imbalance to tap within the Zone 30

2108
01:50:04,280 --> 01:50:07,880
Pips up how many 30 40 pip bangers do we

2109
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:10,639
see Within These Little movements of

2110
01:50:10,639 --> 01:50:13,719
scalping that we would probably be at500

2111
01:50:13,719 --> 01:50:15,840
Pips already

2112
01:50:15,840 --> 01:50:19,040
today just because of

2113
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:22,239
that and now we're here at 35 what are

2114
01:50:22,239 --> 01:50:24,920
we running above this we're running

2115
01:50:24,920 --> 01:50:28,920
above this we still have an area above

2116
01:50:30,280 --> 01:50:34,960
here watch this equal high up

2117
01:50:45,159 --> 01:50:47,000
here this

2118
01:50:47,000 --> 01:50:49,679
is and this is why I teach the way I do

2119
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,599
this is why I teach as long as I do this

2120
01:50:51,599 --> 01:50:53,079
is

2121
01:50:53,079 --> 01:50:56,079
because with videos that are back tested

2122
01:50:56,079 --> 01:50:59,000
everybody's a genius in hindsight

2123
01:50:59,000 --> 01:51:01,280
everybody with so so this may be

2124
01:51:01,280 --> 01:51:04,239
stopping here to potentially push back

2125
01:51:04,239 --> 01:51:08,360
up um with with videos that are in

2126
01:51:08,360 --> 01:51:12,280
hindsight people like I can go back to

2127
01:51:12,280 --> 01:51:15,880
whatever it is um or have the video just

2128
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:17,760
up and ready by the time the video

2129
01:51:17,760 --> 01:51:20,960
starts rolling and because

2130
01:51:20,960 --> 01:51:23,440
you know it's in hindsight I may already

2131
01:51:23,440 --> 01:51:26,520
know what's happening back here you know

2132
01:51:26,520 --> 01:51:27,760
I mean of course I already know what's

2133
01:51:27,760 --> 01:51:29,639
happening back here I've been trading

2134
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:33,719
most of this so I could literally go you

2135
01:51:33,719 --> 01:51:36,320
know like wherever this is whatever area

2136
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,599
this could potentially be in I can go

2137
01:51:38,599 --> 01:51:40,880
and find the area remember the date the

2138
01:51:40,880 --> 01:51:45,440
time find the area and just be like uh

2139
01:51:45,440 --> 01:51:47,239
I'll take this area

2140
01:51:47,239 --> 01:51:50,239
here you know go just like this I'll

2141
01:51:50,239 --> 01:51:53,199
take this area

2142
01:51:54,520 --> 01:51:57,440
here uh maybe I want to use the whole

2143
01:51:57,440 --> 01:52:00,119
Zone and I go just like this maybe I

2144
01:52:00,119 --> 01:52:03,000
want to use the whole

2145
01:52:04,320 --> 01:52:07,199
zone so if price comes up and Taps into

2146
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,960
my zone that's where I'm getting the

2147
01:52:08,960 --> 01:52:11,880
entry from and then I go like

2148
01:52:11,880 --> 01:52:14,760
this oh look you got to tap right into

2149
01:52:14,760 --> 01:52:15,480
the

2150
01:52:15,480 --> 01:52:18,440
Zone it happens every time this way you

2151
01:52:18,440 --> 01:52:19,960
know like people they sound so

2152
01:52:19,960 --> 01:52:23,040
believable and it's like bro you just

2153
01:52:23,040 --> 01:52:25,440
you remember the time you went back and

2154
01:52:25,440 --> 01:52:27,760
you know like do it in real time let's

2155
01:52:27,760 --> 01:52:31,079
let's see it in real time you most times

2156
01:52:31,079 --> 01:52:33,440
you you don't get it you know

2157
01:52:33,440 --> 01:52:36,079
but that's what I want to see like

2158
01:52:36,079 --> 01:52:37,880
that's why I make the the teaching the

2159
01:52:37,880 --> 01:52:41,400
way I do I hear um ICT who supposedly is

2160
01:52:41,400 --> 01:52:45,760
the the founder of smart money um I hear

2161
01:52:45,760 --> 01:52:48,119
that he's actually going to start live

2162
01:52:48,119 --> 01:52:51,400
trading soon and and he's going to start

2163
01:52:51,400 --> 01:52:54,320
live trading because he wants to weed

2164
01:52:54,320 --> 01:52:57,800
out all the people in the industry who

2165
01:52:57,800 --> 01:53:00,159
are trading behind zooms and who are

2166
01:53:00,159 --> 01:53:01,960
losing and who really don't know what

2167
01:53:01,960 --> 01:53:04,280
they're doing he's going to he he

2168
01:53:04,280 --> 01:53:06,000
believes there's an algorithm in price

2169
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:08,000
too and he's saying that he's going to

2170
01:53:08,000 --> 01:53:11,000
trade the algorithm live so he I guess

2171
01:53:11,000 --> 01:53:13,000
make people a Believer or whatever it is

2172
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,400
um I really don't care much to to do

2173
01:53:15,400 --> 01:53:17,040
that I trade because I love talking to

2174
01:53:17,040 --> 01:53:19,040
people and I love looking at charts and

2175
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,440
both of them together together are

2176
01:53:20,440 --> 01:53:23,239
created on YouTube so that's why I trade

2177
01:53:23,239 --> 01:53:24,599
I'm not really looking to prove anything

2178
01:53:24,599 --> 01:53:26,480
to anybody cuz if you look at my trades

2179
01:53:26,480 --> 01:53:28,040
you can see it it's all in real time I'm

2180
01:53:28,040 --> 01:53:30,440
not hiding behind a mentorship or

2181
01:53:30,440 --> 01:53:31,480
anything like that I'm not saying that

2182
01:53:31,480 --> 01:53:33,239
anybody's hiding behind a mentorship

2183
01:53:33,239 --> 01:53:35,440
either you know like they may be

2184
01:53:35,440 --> 01:53:37,119
legitimate reasons for why people do

2185
01:53:37,119 --> 01:53:38,440
that maybe people don't want to share

2186
01:53:38,440 --> 01:53:41,159
their profits to people who are living

2187
01:53:41,159 --> 01:53:43,360
around them or who knows them or

2188
01:53:43,360 --> 01:53:47,159
whatever it is so you don't create this

2189
01:53:47,159 --> 01:53:48,960
this idea where people start to just

2190
01:53:48,960 --> 01:53:50,719
rely on you and depend on you for

2191
01:53:50,719 --> 01:53:53,320
whatever money they need you know so I

2192
01:53:53,320 --> 01:53:54,960
understand why people would use

2193
01:53:54,960 --> 01:53:57,040
mentorships to kind of hide behind that

2194
01:53:57,040 --> 01:54:00,960
you know but in the same sense it's like

2195
01:54:00,960 --> 01:54:02,880
you should be able to still do it on

2196
01:54:02,880 --> 01:54:05,320
demand you're an expert at this or

2197
01:54:05,320 --> 01:54:07,320
you're alleging that you're an expert at

2198
01:54:07,320 --> 01:54:08,840
this you should be able to do all of

2199
01:54:08,840 --> 01:54:11,520
this on demand all of this markup on

2200
01:54:11,520 --> 01:54:14,280
demand and this is for this this is just

2201
01:54:14,280 --> 01:54:17,679
our snds constantly shifting that's all

2202
01:54:17,679 --> 01:54:19,719
this one minute is doing it's const

2203
01:54:19,719 --> 01:54:23,679
stantly shifting our snds that's it and

2204
01:54:23,679 --> 01:54:26,320
all we're doing is we're adjusting to

2205
01:54:26,320 --> 01:54:30,079
the constant shifts of the snds and the

2206
01:54:30,079 --> 01:54:32,480
imbalances and this and that we're we're

2207
01:54:32,480 --> 01:54:35,280
just adjusting to all of that and as

2208
01:54:35,280 --> 01:54:37,639
long as we adjust to that in real time

2209
01:54:37,639 --> 01:54:40,840
then you know we we'll have the

2210
01:54:40,840 --> 01:54:44,079
move we'll always have the move or

2211
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:47,400
always have a move within a market

2212
01:54:47,400 --> 01:54:50,320
always within a day we could have a move

2213
01:54:50,320 --> 01:54:52,560
I mean look at look at the the the um

2214
01:54:52,560 --> 01:54:54,480
the EU trade we call the EU trade from

2215
01:54:54,480 --> 01:54:56,280
up

2216
01:54:56,280 --> 01:55:00,040
here this is from 0

2217
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:02,159
5396 we mentioned it was an imbalance

2218
01:55:02,159 --> 01:55:03,360
that it could tap up here and we

2219
01:55:03,360 --> 01:55:04,719
mentioned you don't get out until you

2220
01:55:04,719 --> 01:55:07,280
see price

2221
01:55:07,719 --> 01:55:11,119
shifting so like I said you might have

2222
01:55:11,119 --> 01:55:13,400
price come up take this High run into

2223
01:55:13,400 --> 01:55:16,960
here and then shift lower so we run the

2224
01:55:16,960 --> 01:55:19,679
trend line liquidity above but then we

2225
01:55:19,679 --> 01:55:21,880
also run the liquidity below and any

2226
01:55:21,880 --> 01:55:23,560
other equal highs equal lows that are

2227
01:55:23,560 --> 01:55:26,920
within that area we just run all of it

2228
01:55:26,920 --> 01:55:29,800
and that's sometimes how the the

2229
01:55:29,800 --> 01:55:31,599
algorithm aggressively

2230
01:55:31,599 --> 01:55:34,679
moves you know but we see certain things

2231
01:55:34,679 --> 01:55:36,440
we see it happen a certain way we see

2232
01:55:36,440 --> 01:55:38,440
shifts in price wherever it is that we

2233
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:41,280
see it and see look look at this is what

2234
01:55:41,280 --> 01:55:43,639
I'm talking about I mentioned to you

2235
01:55:43,639 --> 01:55:46,320
guys the double entry the first one is a

2236
01:55:46,320 --> 01:55:47,920
scalp to come

2237
01:55:47,920 --> 01:55:51,920
down and the next entry is a longer

2238
01:55:51,920 --> 01:55:56,960
move and that's all within this area of

2239
01:55:56,960 --> 01:55:59,800
imbalance sometimes you'll get this

2240
01:55:59,800 --> 01:56:01,639
without

2241
01:56:01,639 --> 01:56:04,599
this sometimes you won't get that

2242
01:56:04,599 --> 01:56:06,960
sometimes it'll just be the tap but at

2243
01:56:06,960 --> 01:56:10,400
times where you get both entries those

2244
01:56:10,400 --> 01:56:11,960
are good for

2245
01:56:11,960 --> 01:56:14,320
you because now you're essentially

2246
01:56:14,320 --> 01:56:17,400
looking at how to become involved in

2247
01:56:17,400 --> 01:56:18,280
this

2248
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:20,560
market and the way you become involved

2249
01:56:20,560 --> 01:56:22,520
in this at least you know if you saw

2250
01:56:22,520 --> 01:56:25,880
this particular

2251
01:56:27,719 --> 01:56:30,840
setup we violated this low we ta back

2252
01:56:30,840 --> 01:56:32,520
into this area

2253
01:56:32,520 --> 01:56:35,719
here we violated this low we came back

2254
01:56:35,719 --> 01:56:37,079
up into this

2255
01:56:37,079 --> 01:56:39,920
area we're expecting to come back up

2256
01:56:39,920 --> 01:56:42,400
into this area but what are we expecting

2257
01:56:42,400 --> 01:56:45,119
we're expecting potentially an imbalance

2258
01:56:45,119 --> 01:56:47,480
touch

2259
01:56:47,480 --> 01:56:51,920
here or maybe one within here smaller

2260
01:56:51,920 --> 01:56:53,599
area of

2261
01:56:53,599 --> 01:56:56,360
price after we ran this low what did we

2262
01:56:56,360 --> 01:56:58,679
get a tap into the first imbalance

2263
01:56:58,679 --> 01:56:59,920
here's why I said play the first

2264
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,239
imbalance one because ICT had mentioned

2265
01:57:02,239 --> 01:57:04,880
it and he gave credible reasons why but

2266
01:57:04,880 --> 01:57:08,320
two because I've seen it happen for

2267
01:57:08,320 --> 01:57:10,960
myself so I'm not going to tell you guys

2268
01:57:10,960 --> 01:57:14,400
to do something that I don't normally do

2269
01:57:14,400 --> 01:57:15,400
when I'm

2270
01:57:15,400 --> 01:57:17,960
trading I'm only making you guys stick

2271
01:57:17,960 --> 01:57:20,040
to that so you have this balance above

2272
01:57:20,040 --> 01:57:22,159
you have this imbalance below you get to

2273
01:57:22,159 --> 01:57:26,000
tap on the imbalance and just 1 minute

2274
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:30,360
after tapping the imbalance we begin to

2275
01:57:30,360 --> 01:57:32,440
shred and then where are we shredding

2276
01:57:32,440 --> 01:57:37,119
into down into here this was a $5 move

2277
01:57:37,119 --> 01:57:42,520
on gold and this scalp was a $2 move on

2278
01:57:42,520 --> 01:57:45,639
gold and that's how you get two entries

2279
01:57:45,639 --> 01:57:49,920
from the same area from the same area so

2280
01:57:49,920 --> 01:57:53,880
AZ had mentioned to me that you know

2281
01:57:53,880 --> 01:57:57,119
with with this in particular um does it

2282
01:57:57,119 --> 01:57:59,679
work on gold and I tell them yeah it

2283
01:57:59,679 --> 01:58:01,599
does it it's the same thing over and

2284
01:58:01,599 --> 01:58:05,119
over and here you have it it's the same

2285
01:58:05,119 --> 01:58:06,880
thing that happened on gold while we

2286
01:58:06,880 --> 01:58:09,199
were away Lo Lolly gaging looking at

2287
01:58:09,199 --> 01:58:11,040
whatever it is we're looking at and we

2288
01:58:11,040 --> 01:58:13,400
have the setup happened the same way and

2289
01:58:13,400 --> 01:58:15,040
all you do is find a setup and you're

2290
01:58:15,040 --> 01:58:17,520
you're golden you're in the

2291
01:58:17,520 --> 01:58:20,560
clear just finding a setup up so look we

2292
01:58:20,560 --> 01:58:23,520
had another tap back into this snd

2293
01:58:23,520 --> 01:58:26,199
here on the lower time frame the snds

2294
01:58:26,199 --> 01:58:27,719
are usually

2295
01:58:27,719 --> 01:58:30,400
shifting so we had another tap back into

2296
01:58:30,400 --> 01:58:32,920
this area here we didn't get a

2297
01:58:32,920 --> 01:58:35,360
mitigation of the middle so watch the

2298
01:58:35,360 --> 01:58:37,159
push back up into this area it could run

2299
01:58:37,159 --> 01:58:39,920
the high give us the middle of the the

2300
01:58:39,920 --> 01:58:43,320
the um mitigation and then trade us

2301
01:58:43,320 --> 01:58:47,639
lower there's an imbalance that's right

2302
01:58:47,639 --> 01:58:50,079
here right below it so you just want to

2303
01:58:50,079 --> 01:58:52,880
pay attention to

2304
01:58:55,079 --> 01:58:57,760
that but this is just rejecting from

2305
01:58:57,760 --> 01:59:01,320
this same snd zone so it's it's going

2306
01:59:01,320 --> 01:59:03,560
right here let me show you

2307
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:07,520
guys from this Zone

2308
01:59:07,800 --> 01:59:12,000
up to this

2309
01:59:15,840 --> 01:59:18,239
above this area

2310
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:20,079
above

2311
01:59:20,079 --> 01:59:22,800
and all it's doing

2312
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:26,800
is up down up down up down I talk about

2313
01:59:26,800 --> 01:59:29,320
this all the time sometimes you have

2314
01:59:29,320 --> 01:59:31,840
price just going between

2315
01:59:31,840 --> 01:59:36,880
snds and we're running lows and highs in

2316
01:59:37,280 --> 01:59:40,000
here we can just continue to do that the

2317
01:59:40,000 --> 01:59:42,280
whole

2318
01:59:42,560 --> 01:59:45,280
time until we finally get a breakout

2319
01:59:45,280 --> 01:59:48,239
above or we get one

2320
01:59:48,239 --> 01:59:51,800
below but we can do that the entire

2321
01:59:51,800 --> 01:59:54,800
time while price is

2322
01:59:54,800 --> 01:59:57,119
ranging I felt like that was a lot today

2323
01:59:57,119 --> 02:00:00,040
guys I felt like I I you know taught a

2324
02:00:00,040 --> 02:00:03,199
lot mentioned a lot that that you know I

2325
02:00:03,199 --> 02:00:04,719
feel like this this would be a good

2326
02:00:04,719 --> 02:00:08,360
video to go into um the earn and learn

2327
02:00:08,360 --> 02:00:12,280
section but I feel like I I you know

2328
02:00:12,280 --> 02:00:16,159
taught Hefty you know it's like a hefty

2329
02:00:16,159 --> 02:00:19,719
style of teaching this actually might

2330
02:00:19,719 --> 02:00:22,920
be the tap in here to potentially run

2331
02:00:22,920 --> 02:00:25,079
this high so watch

2332
02:00:25,079 --> 02:00:26,100
it

2333
02:00:26,100 --> 02:00:29,270
[Music]

2334
02:00:30,360 --> 02:00:34,599
um yep just got the run of the

2335
02:00:34,679 --> 02:00:37,960
high see that
