1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,160
could cause price to reverse and now

2
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:08,760
start going up so where do you want to

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:10,759
buy you want to buy low where do you

4
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:13,120
want to sell you want to sell

5
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:16,440
high so that means that when price is

6
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:19,240
pushing up most people want to take the

7
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:22,160
profit that they have as it's as their

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,519
position is

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,400
increasing close their

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:28,599
order and they've made

11
00:00:28,599 --> 00:00:30,880
money but then some people close their

12
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:33,079
order and want to get in

13
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:36,200
again so getting in

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:39,600
again let me

15
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:47,800
actually right

16
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:50,840
here so getting an

17
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,000
again to go

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,199
up would require you to know where the

19
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,920
market is going to stop and turn

20
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:11,400
around so along this entire pushup right

21
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,360
here along this entire pushup right here

22
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,720
let me just shade that

23
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,799
um along this entire push up while the

24
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:27,720
market was pushing

25
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
up

26
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:35,000
there were certain areas that were left

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,200
behind on this whole move here on this

28
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,280
whole pushup because the market doesn't

29
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:44,640
look like that when it's moving up what

30
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,600
does it look

31
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:50,320
like it looks like

32
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,759
this so since this is the one

33
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:03,200
hour since this is the one

34
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,639
hour if you go down to the 15

35
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:12,480
minute maybe the 15 minute if you go to

36
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,560
the one

37
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:18,599
minute if you get into the one

38
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:21,560
minute you begin to see

39
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:26,160
this let me change this color real

40
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:31,760
quick

41
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,319
this is how you teach free of

42
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,000
charge use your time

43
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:43,080
really on the 15 let me actually zoom

44
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:45,760
into this

45
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,560
s so this this huge move up is

46
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:53,920
that for a couple of hours price was

47
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:57,640
moving it kept going for a couple of

48
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:01,760
hours it kept going up

49
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,799

00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:16,760
turned it down some but there's about 69

55
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:19,840
people on it so if you join the um Zoom

58
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:26,760
hearing this a lot faster not 30 seconds

59
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,680
delayed so

60
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,760
um sorry with

61
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,000
this with this right

62
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,599
here this move

63
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,599
up if you go down to the one hour this

64
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:44,080
is the one hour if you go down to the

65
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,519
the one minute or let's say the five

66
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:48,920
minute you're going to see that this

67
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:51,640
move up this straight move

68
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:55,439
up or or you know it could be you know a

69
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,680
couple of candles like two three

70
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:02,760
candles it could be a candle

71
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,920
here uh let me

72
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:13,120
actually followed by a candle here that

73
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:15,439
went

74
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,040
down Follow by a candle here that went

75
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:29,960
up another candle here that went up

76
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:34,199
another candle here that went

77
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,240
up followed by a

78
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:48,800
candle that went down like

79
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,280
that and then there just happened to be

80
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:00,479
like let's say a huge pushup

81
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,039
and you see it go like

82
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:04,639
that so this is how the market looks

83
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:06,880
when it's moving up and on one hour

84
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,759
you'll see the candles looking like this

85
00:05:10,759 --> 00:05:13,280
on the 1

86
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,000
hour you'll see the candles sorry hold

87
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,759
on you see the candles look like

88
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,440
this on the one

89
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:37,800
hour I don't know why I just didn't do

90
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:41,840
that it look like this and

91
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,600
this is how the market moved up so it

92
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:49,639
was going up it had a pull back down

93
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:52,160
it's going up again it had a pull back

94
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,639
down and it was going up again

95
00:05:55,639 --> 00:05:58,479
so that's how it

96
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,479
looks

97
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:04,639
that's how it

98
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,280
looks just like that on the hourly time

99
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:14,680
frame and on the hourly time

100
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:21,560
frame the highs and lows would be larger

101
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:23,759
like

102
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,479
this going to fix

103
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:31,039
that depending on what you're trading

104
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,520
sorry depending on what you're

105
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,400
trading it would look like that but

106
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:38,639
during that time that it's going up it's

107
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,240
pulling back this

108
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,199
is maybe an hour two three hours that

109
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,120
it's been

110
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:47,160
falling and then you could have a couple

111
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:49,160
hours that it's going

112
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:53,039
up for you where you want to get

113
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:57,680
in is you want to get in at an area

114
00:06:57,680 --> 00:06:59,919
where price is going to continue

115
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:02,639
you or where price is going to begin to

116
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
go down if if you're trading something

117
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:07,440
that you can

118
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:09,440
short that you can

119
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,879
short short is to make money on the

120
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:14,960
downside the price is going down you

121
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,680
believe or you're you're placing a

122
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,759
position or a bet on the price going

123
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:22,000
down and it begins to go down that's

124
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:23,800
shorting it you're you're shorting it

125
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:25,160
there's some people that are

126
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:28,280
shorting while price is going up and

127
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:30,680
that's how they're losing as as price is

128
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,319
going up they they're saying we're

129
00:07:33,319 --> 00:07:36,360
placing a bet essentially that it's

130
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:37,919
going to be going down based on what I

131
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,280
looked at this chart based on what I

132
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:44,000
looked at the chart and the chart

133
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,199
said so I'm going to enter a short

134
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:53,800
position and that in an uptrend in a

135
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,440
market that's going up you could enter a

136
00:07:56,440 --> 00:07:57,680
short

137
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:00,120
position anywhere where where you see

138
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:02,879
the market retracing and you can enter a

139
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,800
long position anywhere you see the

140
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,080
market is

141
00:08:07,080 --> 00:08:10,479
going up

142
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:15,240
from now on the one hour it looks like

143
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,199
this but let's say the the the five

144
00:08:18,199 --> 00:08:21,759
minute the the the one minute let's say

145
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:24,680
that the five minute in one

146
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,240
minute begins to look like

147
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
this

148
00:08:57,160 --> 00:09:01,200
so now it looks like this

149
00:09:04,880 --> 00:09:07,200
and now you

150
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:12,480

sorry guys so here's here's a better

167
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:13,880
picture of it to women do things better

than men

169
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:19,240
right here's a better picture of

170
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,440
it this is how it

171
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:27,320
looks so let's say this

172
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:30,800
one black line going up is the 1

173
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,399
hour you have the one

174
00:10:33,399 --> 00:10:37,720
minute which is this green Trend and

175
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:40,000
it's it's a series of highs and lows

176
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,680
highs lows highs lows high high low high

177
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:44,600
low high low high low but on the on

178
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:48,639
let's say the 15 minute on the 15 minute

179
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:50,920
it's one

180
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,440
low one

181
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,800
high one

182
00:10:55,800 --> 00:10:57,800
low one

183
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:00,000
high one one

184
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,399
low one high and the hourly it's

185
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:09,360
just one low and one high so you see all

186
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:11,279
of these different pullbacks on one

187
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,680
minute followed by these slower

188
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:23,240
pullbacks what Zer one 2 3 4 you see

189
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:27,120
that this is actually pointing

190
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,200
to the fact that on the one minute

191
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,800
there's more pullbacks to time and hope

192
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:34,839
to be right there's more opportunities

193
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,360
where you hope to be right or more

194
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:38,519
opportunities where you can be

195
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:41,079
wrong

196
00:11:41,079 --> 00:11:44,120
versus there are less

197
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,560
opportunities on the

198
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:49,560
15minute and they're slower

199
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:53,040
opportunities they're not happening as

200
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,839
fast to be right but if you're trying to

201
00:11:56,839 --> 00:11:59,760
make money for the day

202
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,279
you have about three to four

203
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:04,240
opportunities on the one

204
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:06,800
minute within that short amount of time

205
00:12:06,800 --> 00:12:09,680
that you're trading one two hours to be

206
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,040
right or

207
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,040
wrong to be right or

208
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:18,440
wrong to be right about a pullback or

209
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,760
wrong about a pullback to be right about

210
00:12:19,760 --> 00:12:21,170
a reversal or wrong about a

211
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,600
[Music]

212
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:25,360
reversal but it's literally like this

213
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,880
the Market's moving like

214
00:12:27,880 --> 00:12:29,639
this

215
00:12:29,639 --> 00:12:32,440
and if you look

216
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,880
here remember I said that the

217
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,680
market pulls back so let's say this is

218
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,240
the hourly

219
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,440
pullback the hourly pullback here's the

220
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,920
hourly beginning wait what is that no

221
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:52,360
here's the hourly

222
00:12:52,360 --> 00:12:56,279
beginning here's the hourly um top of

223
00:12:56,279 --> 00:13:00,160
the market and reversal

224
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:01,639
and the hourly

225
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:07,600
reversal led us here it stopped

226
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,839
here before

227
00:13:12,839 --> 00:13:16,680
continuing up above like

228
00:13:17,399 --> 00:13:20,959
that stop

229
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,760
there yeah stop there and continue up

230
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,800
above

231
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,440
so when the

232
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,600
hourly time frame is pulling

233
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:38,120
back what do you

234
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:42,040
have just like on this move up where on

235
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,880
the one or five minute you have these

236
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,320
series of highs and lows coming

237
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:49,480
up with these highs and

238
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:53,800
lows you could place a buy here I don't

239
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:56,519
know what this

240
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,759
was

241
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,680
you can place a buy here oh it's because

242
00:14:04,680 --> 00:14:08,759
it zoomed out you can place a buy here

243
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:11,040
when price comes back to the area that

244
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:13,360
you're looking to buy

245
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,360
from and you can take profit or take

246
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:20,320
your money out of the market as it

247
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,160
increases when price goes above the high

248
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:26,160
above the the high that is going above

249
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:27,120
to the

250
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,040
left there's this low there's this High

251
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:36,199
there's this low and then we break

252
00:14:36,199 --> 00:14:40,360
above the high that brought us down here

253
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:43,759
now this is only happening

254
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,199
on the one minute or the five minute on

255
00:14:48,199 --> 00:14:50,480
the

256
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,959
hourly it looks like a

257
00:14:55,959 --> 00:15:02,120
candle that's going often times up and

258
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,959
down you see it going up and down so if

259
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:07,320
the candle opens and let's say it opens

260
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,040
right

261
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:10,519
here let's say this this is a candle

262
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:14,000
opening and it starts to go up if the

263
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:18,120
candle op and it begins to go

264
00:15:20,680 --> 00:15:23,440
up the candle opens and it begins to go

265
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:27,959
up it looks like this it looks like this

266
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:32,199
but if the handle begins to go back

267
00:15:32,199 --> 00:15:33,720
down

268
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:36,959
because on the one minute time

269
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:41,720
frame remember what we said we can go

270
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:47,759
up and back down a number of times a

271
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,279
series of times we can go up and

272
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:56,800
down a series of

273
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,600
times so while that one minute

274
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,160
candle has been

275
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:06,319
formed while that one minute candle has

276
00:16:06,319 --> 00:16:08,560
been

277
00:16:09,440 --> 00:16:11,959
formed sorry the one hour candle while

278
00:16:11,959 --> 00:16:14,040
the one hour candle's formed we have

279
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:15,839
price going like

280
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,800
this that whole hour and sometimes the

281
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:22,240
hour can close here the hour candle can

282
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,360
close right there and the candle looks

283
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:28,800
like that sometimes it can close there

284
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:30,759
and the candle looks like

285
00:16:30,759 --> 00:16:35,120
that sometimes it can close down

286
00:16:40,639 --> 00:16:44,880
here and the candle looks like

287
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:56,079
that yeah kind of looks like

288
00:16:57,480 --> 00:17:00,480
that

289
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,240
it could look just like that they call

290
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:07,280
that a dogee it's actually institutional

291
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:10,760
candle looks like

292
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:15,160
that

293
00:17:15,160 --> 00:17:18,799
so when this

294
00:17:21,079 --> 00:17:24,240
happens it's because on a lower time

295
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:26,839
frame oh no let me just delete some of

296
00:17:26,839 --> 00:17:30,400
this so it doesn't look

297
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,760
when this happens like

298
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:44,080
this it's because when the candle opened

299
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,000
up when the candle opened up let's say

300
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,360
this was the candle let me move some of

301
00:17:49,360 --> 00:17:52,240
this out the way right

302
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,400
now when the candle opened up we were

303
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:59,120
here

304
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,440
and the the price went

305
00:18:02,440 --> 00:18:04,320
down and

306
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:07,919
then during during the hour we started

307
00:18:07,919 --> 00:18:10,039
to go back up again on the lower time

308
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,720
frame on the lower time frame we started

309
00:18:11,720 --> 00:18:15,360
to go back again go back up and as we

310
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,480
were going back

311
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:20,520
up couple minutes later we started going

312
00:18:20,520 --> 00:18:21,880
down

313
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:27,039
again and we did that during that

314
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:32,440
hour and the candle closed like

315
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:37,559
this the candle closed just like

316
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,159
this

317
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:42,520
because the first half of the hour we

318
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,159
were going down the second half of the

319
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:46,679
hour we began to go

320
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,520
up and then by the time the next hour

321
00:18:50,520 --> 00:18:53,440
candle was opening up price was back

322
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,320
here and all of this happened within one

323
00:18:57,320 --> 00:19:00,480
hour all of this this entire thing this

324
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:02,640
moved down this moved back up this moved

325
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,799
down happened in one hour so what what

326
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:07,400
were there an opportunity to go short an

327
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,960
opportunity to go long an opportunity to

328
00:19:09,960 --> 00:19:12,120
go short again and an opportunity to go

329
00:19:12,120 --> 00:19:15,000
long again that's only if you're trading

330
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:19,039
on the lower time frames you find

331
00:19:19,039 --> 00:19:22,720
multiple opportunities during the day to

332
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,240
be able to take a position to buy or to

333
00:19:27,240 --> 00:19:30,240
sell

334
00:19:32,159 --> 00:19:35,159
so let me bring this

335
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:40,960
back so we begin to head

336
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,200
up

337
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:50,600
and and this is how we're looking for

338
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:53,440
the hourly we're going up like this on

339
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:55,120
the the one minute the five minute the

340
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,440
15 minute 10 minute whatever it is it's

341
00:19:58,440 --> 00:20:00,720
go has a series of ups and downs highs

342
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,400
and lows that's what they call it highs

343
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,960
and lows that's what it's

344
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:07,960
called

345
00:20:09,159 --> 00:20:13,360
so this is the low of the hourly Trend

346
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:16,600
this is the high of the hourly Trend and

347
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:19,080
this is where the hourly Trend pulled

348
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:23,760
back then the hourly Trend continued up

349
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:25,679
what's the trend I forgot to say that

350
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:28,960
I'm sorry guys the trend

351
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:31,919
is if the market is going up there's a

352
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:34,240
bunch of highs and lows that are created

353
00:20:34,240 --> 00:20:37,679
as it's going up that's trending

354
00:20:37,679 --> 00:20:40,600
up if the market is going

355
00:20:40,600 --> 00:20:43,200
down that's a series of highs and lows

356
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,000
that are trending

357
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:50,960
down trending

358
00:20:52,080 --> 00:20:55,000
down

359
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,720
so with the market going up you're in an

360
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:58,640
uptrend

361
00:20:58,640 --> 00:21:00,960
Trend and with the market going down

362
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,039
you're in a downtrend a downtrend I'm

363
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:07,320
saying that for people who just may not

364
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,400
really understand that the

365
00:21:11,400 --> 00:21:16,320
downtrend looks exactly like the

366
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:19,840
uptrend where we are

367
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:23,720
going down we make a high and then we

368
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,320
make another low we make a high and then

369
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:30,880
we make a another low we make a high and

370
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,039
then we make another

371
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,159
low like that this is what the one

372
00:21:39,159 --> 00:21:41,520
minute the five minute is doing as you

373
00:21:41,520 --> 00:21:44,279
see the one

374
00:21:47,080 --> 00:21:50,000
hour as you see the one

375
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:53,159
hour just launching back like Godzilla

376
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:54,080
before

377
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:57,559
you and you would just be praying that

378
00:21:57,559 --> 00:22:01,000
you didn't buy right

379
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,799
here to go

380
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,000
up because now you're going down and

381
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:16,320
your position is is going down in value

382
00:22:16,320 --> 00:22:18,960
and a lot of people because they got in

383
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,919
here they hold the

384
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,600
position

385
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,960
hoping that it's going to

386
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,039
get

387
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:30,679
back

388
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,279
here

389
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:35,760
again they hold

390
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:40,440
that here hoping that it comes back here

391
00:22:40,440 --> 00:22:44,240
again as it's going

392
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:47,400
down and it's decreasing and becoming

393
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:51,360
worthless with every push

394
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,120
down oh you know every push

395
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,559
down it's coming worthless and worthless

396
00:22:57,559 --> 00:22:59,039
and worthless and worthless and then

397
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:02,559
they close in a

398
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:06,480
loss because they don't understand that

399
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:08,600
now that the market is going

400
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:12,520
down if you are

401
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:22,919
trading you should be

402
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:26,880
short you should be

403
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,320
short

404
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:31,880
until the market gets back

405
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:37,440
to what the hourly

406
00:23:37,600 --> 00:23:41,120
place that it's

407
00:23:44,679 --> 00:23:48,080
looking to

408
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:53,159
continue

409
00:23:54,120 --> 00:23:56,760
up like

410
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:00,799
that just just make that like that

411
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,279
continue

412
00:24:03,559 --> 00:24:06,840
up so the higher time

413
00:24:06,840 --> 00:24:09,480
frame

414
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,760
this the green maybe I should make it

415
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,320
yellow because it might look a little

416
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,840
better yellow is the hourly

417
00:24:20,840 --> 00:24:23,279
Trend and the hourly trend has been

418
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,279
going up for hours sometime days

419
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:31,440
sometime weeks is going up depending on

420
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:33,840
what time frame you're looking

421
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,279
at so if you're trading from the hourly

422
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:41,640
you have to wait until maybe Tuesday to

423
00:24:41,640 --> 00:24:43,640
get in a position that might bring you

424
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:50,279
to your profit on Thursday Friday

425
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:54,120
maybe but if you're trading on the one

426
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:56,480
minute the 15

427
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,880
minute you may be getting in at a

428
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:04,080
position you know at maybe like I don't

429
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,120
know 10

430
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:10,159
10:30 and you may hold that position

431
00:25:10,159 --> 00:25:12,360
until 12 o'l and be like you know what

432
00:25:12,360 --> 00:25:13,480
I'm

433
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,440
out so as the hourly Trend was going

434
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,720
up you took a little bit

435
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:24,039
of you took a position and got out of

436
00:25:24,039 --> 00:25:25,240
the

437
00:25:25,240 --> 00:25:29,080
move in profit

438
00:25:29,080 --> 00:25:35,760
along this 1 hour hourly Trend

439
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:42,200
up and you were Guided by where you you

440
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:49,480
saw the hourly move turning

441
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:52,679
around so when the market is going up

442
00:25:52,679 --> 00:25:55,240
it's because there's a

443
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:58,720
demand for for that particular thing

444
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:02,200
that stop that that you know that market

445
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:05,760
as a whole there's a demand for

446
00:26:05,760 --> 00:26:11,520
it so on the charts you can see where

447
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:14,200
the demand is

448
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:18,880
at you can see where the demand is

449
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:25,120
located and often times the demand is

450
00:26:25,120 --> 00:26:28,120
located at a particular point

451
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,360
that the market

452
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,080
reversed and the same way we

453
00:26:35,080 --> 00:26:41,200
have the demand that sends price

454
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,399
higher sorry

455
00:26:46,440 --> 00:26:49,120
let we have the demand

456
00:26:49,120 --> 00:26:51,840
that we have the demand that sends price

457
00:26:51,840 --> 00:26:54,840
higher down here

458
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:59,720
right we have a Supply

459
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:03,000
above right

460
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,279
here that's

461
00:27:06,279 --> 00:27:08,919
designed and it's it's it's not there

462
00:27:08,919 --> 00:27:11,880
it's actually back

463
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:17,720
here we have a supply

464
00:27:17,720 --> 00:27:19,520
area that's

465
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:22,000
above right

466
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,960
here some previous area as price was

467
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:28,840
going down

468
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:32,200
that price sorry actually I should I

469
00:27:32,200 --> 00:27:34,880
should actually just stick

470
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:39,120
with and mitigate it for

471
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:59,519
now so right here you have a supply area

472
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:04,760
above down

473
00:28:04,760 --> 00:28:08,200
here somewhere below you have a

474
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,720
demand

475
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,480
area that demand

476
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:16,279
area that demand From

477
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:29,440
Below

478
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:53,080
that demand area

479
00:28:55,240 --> 00:28:59,399
below is where price

480
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:05,039
originally came

481
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:07,880
from

482
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:11,159
so two weeks

483
00:29:11,159 --> 00:29:15,720
ago the market was down here at these

484
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:19,679
levels and the market began to go up and

485
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:22,279
it kept pushing

486
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:26,720
up and when price came back let me

487
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:29,320
actually just

488
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:33,559
when price came back to the area that it

489
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,519
was two weeks

490
00:29:36,519 --> 00:29:40,559
ago there was still this area that it

491
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:42,039
was at two weeks

492
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,760
ago there was still people willing to

493
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,799
buy at this price there was a ton of

494
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,240
people waiting because

495
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:56,279
what they missed this whole move right

496
00:29:56,279 --> 00:29:59,440
here going up I'm highlighted

497
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:02,480
red they missed that whole move right

498
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:07,440
here going up this whole move going

499
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:10,799
up and price

500
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,360
came back to the

501
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,480
area where it

502
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:20,919
sent that whole move up but on the way

503
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:24,760
back down on the way back down it's

504
00:30:24,760 --> 00:30:28,240
downtrending right

505
00:30:28,240 --> 00:30:32,120
it's down trending High sorry low high

506
00:30:32,120 --> 00:30:33,640
low

507
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,720
high low

508
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:39,799
high so as it's going

509
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:43,679
down as it's going

510
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:50,600
down you can get into a

511
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:54,600
position a short

512
00:30:56,240 --> 00:31:00,480
position to say based

513
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:06,519
on based on what I've

514
00:31:08,840 --> 00:31:14,000
analyzed or based on where we

515
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,519
previously pulled back from because

516
00:31:16,519 --> 00:31:18,080
remember we said that there there are

517
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:20,799
pullbacks right and then continuations

518
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:23,519
the market continues going up after it

519
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,720
pulls back it continues going up

520
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:32,679
after it pulls back it's in a healthy

521
00:31:32,840 --> 00:31:38,240
Market or it continues going

522
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,760
down right here let me um highlight this

523
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:42,519
a different

524
00:31:42,519 --> 00:31:46,760
color it continues going

525
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:57,960
down it continues going down

526
00:31:57,960 --> 00:32:01,279
so what you see here what you see here

527
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,559
this this

528
00:32:03,559 --> 00:32:06,080
yellow movement down this yellow line

529
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:09,159
This is the movement down so if you know

530
00:32:09,159 --> 00:32:13,320
where the market is going to begin to go

531
00:32:13,519 --> 00:32:15,519
down if you know where the market is

532
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:18,639
going to begin to go down you can enter

533
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:22,159
a short position to make money while

534
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,120
it's going

535
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:28,159
down and every area where you believe

536
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:31,440
it's retracing up and tapping into to

537
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:36,799
continue down you can add another

538
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:41,760
position going

539
00:32:42,919 --> 00:32:47,480
down going down so now you're making two

540
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:49,960
times the

541
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,919
money that you would have been

542
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,080
making if you took two positions up here

543
00:33:00,080 --> 00:33:02,600
you began to make two times when this

544
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:05,760
position was opened and you continue

545
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:09,080
down that's given that the market will

546
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,600
continue

547
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:14,000
down how do we know the market is not

548
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:17,200
going to continue

549
00:33:17,880 --> 00:33:23,600
down well the area that it came from is

550
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:24,399
the

551
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:25,960
deciding

552
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,600
factor so this whole pushup right here

553
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:31,440
came from

554
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,240
here this is where the market came back

555
00:33:34,240 --> 00:33:37,399
to right

556
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:41,960
here and it pushed up again from here so

557
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,799
here is

558
00:33:43,799 --> 00:33:49,000
where you want to be buying to go

559
00:33:49,000 --> 00:33:51,679
up and

560
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:55,120
here is where you want to take your

561
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:59,440
profit or you want to begin

562
00:33:59,440 --> 00:34:01,799
shorting to go

563
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,039
down but you will only know those areas

564
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:08,079
to Short from and hold as the market

565
00:34:08,079 --> 00:34:10,560
begins its down cycle you see this one

566
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:15,560
minute red um the the the red

567
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:18,040
lines that's the market going down and

568
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,760
that's multiple positions on the one

569
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:22,040
minute to be able to find an entry and

570
00:34:22,040 --> 00:34:23,480

down the problem

572
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:29,119
is Within These multiple entries to go

573
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,599
up and

574
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,839
down Within These multiple entries to go

575
00:34:38,839 --> 00:34:41,280
up and

00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:48,719

opportunities to find an

00:35:07,680 --> 00:35:11,599
area that you can get in to go

582
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,599
short or find an

583
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,920
area that you can get

584
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:20,079
in to go

585
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:23,119
long and it doesn't mean that on the one

586
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,560
minute you're getting or the five minute

587
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:29,680
you're getting in in a

588
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:31,680
position right

589
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,960
here that doesn't mean you're getting in

590
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,520
a

591
00:35:35,520 --> 00:35:39,079
position sorry let

592
00:35:43,720 --> 00:35:47,119
me to

593
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,839
hold let's say you got in there that

594
00:35:49,839 --> 00:35:51,119
doesn't mean that you're getting in a

595
00:35:51,119 --> 00:35:54,480
position to hold to continue all the way

596
00:35:54,480 --> 00:35:57,280
up here you wanted to go all all the way

597
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:59,520
up

598
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:03,079
here because that's not the that's not

599
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,720
the way the market moves there's only

600
00:36:05,720 --> 00:36:08,359
one

601
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,880
place there's only one actually

602
00:36:17,119 --> 00:36:20,319
this most people are trying to buy here

603
00:36:20,319 --> 00:36:22,200
right

604
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:25,480
here in this green

605
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:29,160
area and they're buying to go up but

606
00:36:29,160 --> 00:36:32,440
this area is not the area

607
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:34,880
designed to send the

608
00:36:34,880 --> 00:36:38,800
market very high like push the market

609
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:43,359
High you can't expect to hold and hold

610
00:36:43,359 --> 00:36:46,280
so much

611
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:49,240
profit all the way until we get all the

612
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:50,880
way up

613
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:52,640
here

614
00:36:52,640 --> 00:36:55,000
because the market is

615
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:58,520
trending down

616
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:03,440
so if you chose to take this position to

617
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:07,119
buy just know that it's

618
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:13,319
going to a position to sell or to

619
00:37:13,560 --> 00:37:16,720
short so you're

620
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:20,079
buying you're

621
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,599
buying to go to the Aira

622
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,319
that you're

623
00:37:33,319 --> 00:37:37,440
looking to Short from in a downtrend if

624
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:39,640
you want to get involved here then you

625
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,520
can but you have to know you're getting

626
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:44,240
involved here on the one

627
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:48,119
minute to go up

628
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,040
here and because the market is going

629
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:53,960
down you're going to get more from

630
00:37:53,960 --> 00:37:55,599
finding a

631
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:58,599
position

632
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:01,839
to go

633
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,000
down then you

634
00:38:09,240 --> 00:38:13,680
will for finding a position to go up

635
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:17,079
because the overall Market is currently

636
00:38:17,079 --> 00:38:19,960
going down but that doesn't mean that

637
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:22,880
there's not quick opportunities that you

638
00:38:22,880 --> 00:38:25,960
can go up with because as the market as

639
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,200
the as there a series of highs and lows

640
00:38:28,200 --> 00:38:29,560
highs and

641
00:38:29,560 --> 00:38:33,359
lows you can

642
00:38:36,119 --> 00:38:40,839
time where to buy those lows

643
00:38:42,359 --> 00:38:46,119
from and where to sell or

644
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:49,880
short those highs

645
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,520
from where to buy or

646
00:38:55,280 --> 00:38:59,920
long a low in a falling Market where to

647
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:03,480
buy or long a low as a market is going

648
00:39:03,480 --> 00:39:05,640
down because the markets go up and they

649
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:08,880
go down every single day you can get

650
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:11,480
involved in a trade going up or a trade

651
00:39:11,480 --> 00:39:13,319
going down to make money but you need to

652
00:39:13,319 --> 00:39:16,200
know where you're going to get involved

653
00:39:16,200 --> 00:39:19,920
in that trade going up and for how long

654
00:39:19,920 --> 00:39:22,000
and where you're going to get involved

655
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:25,440
in that trade going

656
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,920
down for how long

657
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:33,119
too because just because it's been going

658
00:39:33,119 --> 00:39:36,400
down for most of the day doesn't mean

659
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:39,920
that somewhere during the

660
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:44,480
day it can

661
00:39:44,480 --> 00:39:50,599
have a huge pushup and start to

662
00:39:52,359 --> 00:39:55,400
now Trend

663
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,160
up and as it's trending

664
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:02,280
up all you're looking for as it's

665
00:40:02,280 --> 00:40:06,400
trending up guys pay attention to this

666
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,560
and and nothing else when it comes to to

667
00:40:09,560 --> 00:40:13,839
to structure all you're looking

668
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:20,599
for is for areas in which you can get

669
00:40:22,119 --> 00:40:25,359
in for a

670
00:40:25,359 --> 00:40:31,560
short or get in for a long get in for a

671
00:40:31,560 --> 00:40:35,200
buy or get in for a

672
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,319
sell and depending on the time frame

673
00:40:38,319 --> 00:40:40,599
that you're

674
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:43,400
on depending on the time frame that

675
00:40:43,400 --> 00:40:45,720
you're

676
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:49,480
on you have multiple

677
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,520
opportunities to

678
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:55,560
buy and you have multiple opportunities

679
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:59,720
to sell so the higher the time frame you

680
00:40:59,720 --> 00:41:01,319
are

681
00:41:01,319 --> 00:41:04,400
on the less

682
00:41:04,400 --> 00:41:08,079
opportunities there are to find a

683
00:41:08,079 --> 00:41:09,920
position to buy

684
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:13,119
in or to find a position to sell in or

685
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:15,440
to find a position to short in or to

686
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:17,839
find a position to long in or find a

687
00:41:17,839 --> 00:41:20,000
position to enter in or find the

688
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:22,960
position to exit in whatever it is that

689
00:41:22,960 --> 00:41:25,760
your mind makes up as to why you're

690
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,680
getting in where you're getting out it's

691
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,920
either to buy or to sell too short or

692
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,560
too long to get in an as an entry and to

693
00:41:34,560 --> 00:41:37,000
take

694
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,680
profit to take profit

695
00:41:40,680 --> 00:41:43,240
right I hope this is making sense for

696
00:41:43,240 --> 00:41:45,480
somebody so we remember where all of

697
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:48,119
these these these

698
00:41:48,119 --> 00:41:50,560
Longs where all of these Longs and these

699
00:41:50,560 --> 00:41:55,319
shorts are they're highs and lows and

700
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:57,440
there areas where you could get in for a

701
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,760
short get in to sell or get get in to

702
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,359
buy and go up that's all I want you to

703
00:42:04,359 --> 00:42:05,400
think about I don't want you to think

704
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,480
about anything else no power bot power

705
00:42:07,480 --> 00:42:11,480
bottom Hammer bar nothing nothing just

706
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:13,680
that movement alone this is what we're

707
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:16,520
teaching the structure of the

708
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:19,559
market so the structure of the

709
00:42:19,559 --> 00:42:24,319
market moves This Way series of highs

710
00:42:24,319 --> 00:42:26,559
and lows going down on a lower time

711
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:28,760
frame on a higher time frame it can just

712
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:31,680
look like it's just going

713
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,240
down so on a higher time frame there's

714
00:42:34,240 --> 00:42:37,000
that opportunity as it's going

715
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:39,760
down there's that opportunity to go down

716
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:44,720
for a longer period of time and stop

717
00:42:44,720 --> 00:42:48,720
then turn around and go up for a longer

718
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:51,280
period of time but within the smaller

719
00:42:51,280 --> 00:42:53,160
time frames it's going up then it's

720
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:54,920
going down then it's going up then it's

721
00:42:54,920 --> 00:42:56,480
going down then it's going up up then

722
00:42:56,480 --> 00:42:58,119
it's going down then it's going up then

723
00:42:58,119 --> 00:42:59,760
it's going down then it's going up then

724
00:42:59,760 --> 00:43:02,000
it's going down then it's going down

725
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:03,640
then it's going up then it's going down

726
00:43:03,640 --> 00:43:05,280
then it's going up then it's going down

727
00:43:05,280 --> 00:43:06,480
and that's all of this that I just

728
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,119
explained right

729
00:43:08,119 --> 00:43:12,160
here so if you draw it on your

730
00:43:12,160 --> 00:43:16,160
chart when we're going

731
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,079
up in a higher time frame

732
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:23,440
Trend there will be

733
00:43:23,440 --> 00:43:25,079
multiple

734
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,359
highs and

735
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,599
lows highs and

736
00:43:30,599 --> 00:43:34,720
lows highs and lows if you're looking at

737
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:36,920
the lower time

738
00:43:36,920 --> 00:43:39,640
frame if you're looking at the higher

739
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,800
time

740
00:43:41,800 --> 00:43:45,400
frame all you'll

741
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:51,520
see is price going

742
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:55,079
up and then price going

743
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,520
down

744
00:43:57,520 --> 00:43:59,559
and it will

745
00:43:59,559 --> 00:44:03,160
take this move

746
00:44:03,160 --> 00:44:05,880
up it could be a couple of hours that

747
00:44:05,880 --> 00:44:07,280
it's doing

748
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,960
that and now as it's going

749
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:13,839
down it's going down for a couple of

750
00:44:13,839 --> 00:44:15,000
hours

751
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,400
too it's just within those hours that

752
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:20,359
it's going up there's multiple people

753
00:44:20,359 --> 00:44:22,079
buying and selling buying and selling

754
00:44:22,079 --> 00:44:23,599
buying and selling buying and selling

755
00:44:23,599 --> 00:44:25,119
buying and selling buying and selling

756
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:26,559
buying and selling

757
00:44:26,559 --> 00:44:28,319
but there's more

758
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,599
buying going

759
00:44:30,599 --> 00:44:33,480
on than there is selling or taking

760
00:44:33,480 --> 00:44:36,160
profit and as it's going

761
00:44:36,160 --> 00:44:38,640
down there's more buying and selling

762
00:44:38,640 --> 00:44:40,240
buying and selling buying and selling

763
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:41,760
buying and selling buying and selling

764
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:43,280
buying and selling buying and selling

765
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:46,359
buying and selling there's more of that

766
00:44:46,359 --> 00:44:51,000
but what there's more

767
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:53,880
sales there's more people selling or

768
00:44:53,880 --> 00:44:57,280
shorting the position

769
00:44:57,280 --> 00:45:00,599
then there are people

770
00:45:00,599 --> 00:45:03,480
longing so the people who are longing

771
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:06,720
have limited opportunities to buy get in

772
00:45:06,720 --> 00:45:09,559
and get out buy get in and get out buy

773
00:45:09,559 --> 00:45:11,559
get in and get out buy get in and get

774
00:45:11,559 --> 00:45:13,880
out they have multiple opportunities but

775
00:45:13,880 --> 00:45:15,319
they are

776
00:45:15,319 --> 00:45:19,079
limited why are they

777
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:21,760
limited they're limited because

778
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:26,440
according to the parent time frame

779
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:29,800
according to the parent

780
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,119
structure according to the structure

781
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:36,839
that has the authority

782
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:41,440
more than the lower time frame structure

783
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:44,440
according to the higher time frame

784
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:49,319
structure we are going

785
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:56,520
up so More Money Follows that until what

786
00:45:56,520 --> 00:45:59,000
until

787
00:45:59,280 --> 00:46:03,359
what until we hit what's called our

788
00:46:03,359 --> 00:46:06,079
supply so when the market started to go

789
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:08,839
up I told you that it was going up from

790
00:46:08,839 --> 00:46:11,400
a place of

791
00:46:11,400 --> 00:46:14,920
demand I told you where the demand was

792
00:46:14,920 --> 00:46:17,880
the demand is

793
00:46:17,880 --> 00:46:21,359
located at the

794
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:27,800
beginning of this whole trend

795
00:46:28,280 --> 00:46:31,200
that we moved up with it's at the

796
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:33,760
beginning the beginning of it the

797
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:35,680
beginning of it listen to that I'm going

798
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:38,079
to get into the other stuff with with

799
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:40,319
supply and demand because there's

800
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:43,000
multiple demands and multiple supplies

801
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:46,520
when you are on different time

802
00:46:46,520 --> 00:46:49,480
frames in the current market you might

803
00:46:49,480 --> 00:46:53,559
see one Supply area above and one demand

804
00:46:53,559 --> 00:46:54,800
area

805
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,760
below

806
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,559
on a higher time

807
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:01,720
frame but on a lower time frame you see

808
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:05,640
a bunch of Supply areas above and a

809
00:47:05,640 --> 00:47:09,240
bunch of demand areas

810
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,160
below what are those supply and demand

811
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:14,079
areas on the lower time

812
00:47:14,079 --> 00:47:16,359
frame what are

813
00:47:16,359 --> 00:47:21,240
they those supply and demand

814
00:47:23,839 --> 00:47:27,079
areas are

815
00:47:27,079 --> 00:47:29,280
the

816
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,599
lows and the

817
00:47:37,119 --> 00:47:40,040
highs

818
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:43,839
but when we're going

819
00:47:43,839 --> 00:47:47,160
up when we're going

820
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:50,400
up the

821
00:47:50,760 --> 00:47:53,160
supply is a

822
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:54,720
previous

823
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,720
High

824
00:47:59,839 --> 00:48:04,240
Supply is a previous high in the

825
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:07,240
market you see up here previous high in

826
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:09,359
the

827
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,160
market this red this let me let me

828
00:48:12,160 --> 00:48:13,680
actually just change this color right

829
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,680
here so it's not

830
00:48:16,680 --> 00:48:22,520
confusing this is a previous high in the

831
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:27,640
market that the price or or the the

832
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,800
candlesticks that are going

833
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:36,040
up they will tap into it'll

834
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:40,760
touch and then what it's going to begin

835
00:48:40,760 --> 00:48:43,359
going

836
00:48:43,800 --> 00:48:47,160
down it's going to begin going

837
00:48:47,160 --> 00:48:48,839
down

838
00:48:48,839 --> 00:48:51,160
after it

839
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:54,520
touches that

840
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:56,119
area

841
00:48:56,119 --> 00:48:58,079
it begins to go

842
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:01,640
down so when it touches that

843
00:49:01,640 --> 00:49:05,640
area in the current Trend going

844
00:49:05,640 --> 00:49:08,640
up me just make this another

845
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:11,359
color in the current Trend going up to

846
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:12,880
take us

847
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:15,079
there this current Trend that's heading

848
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:16,880
up to take us

849
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,480
there you'll see the the let me actually

850
00:49:19,480 --> 00:49:21,760
just draw it better um I could actually

851
00:49:21,760 --> 00:49:24,480
just use arrows I don't know why I don't

852
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:26,920
do this

853
00:49:26,920 --> 00:49:31,520
in the current Trend that's heading

854
00:49:32,760 --> 00:49:35,680
up we're

855
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,000
going to a supply a

856
00:49:40,000 --> 00:49:42,119
previous

857
00:49:42,119 --> 00:49:44,280
area or a

858
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:46,920
previous High

859
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:50,920
Point in that former Trend that price

860
00:49:50,920 --> 00:49:54,119
was was coming down

861
00:49:54,119 --> 00:49:58,160
in we will go back to those

862
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:01,040
highs and at those highs there are

863
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,760
different things that take

864
00:50:05,119 --> 00:50:08,680
place you'll have

865
00:50:08,680 --> 00:50:12,040
price go

866
00:50:14,240 --> 00:50:17,280
down after touching

867
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,640
there and it will go down

868
00:50:21,640 --> 00:50:26,319
into some area below which is the demand

869
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:29,720
the previous

870
00:50:29,720 --> 00:50:33,240
demand there's there's a series of

871
00:50:33,240 --> 00:50:35,079
remember what I said there's a series of

872
00:50:35,079 --> 00:50:38,520
of highs and lows in here on this hourly

873
00:50:38,520 --> 00:50:40,480
Trend the yellow the yellow line on this

874
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:43,920
hourly Trend there's a series of highs

875
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,599
and lows in

876
00:50:46,839 --> 00:50:49,559
here and with a series of highs and lows

877
00:50:49,559 --> 00:50:54,680
in here there are lows on the lower time

878
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:57,440
frame

879
00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:00,920
little pullbacks on the lower time frame

880
00:51:00,920 --> 00:51:05,400
little retracements on the lower time

881
00:51:06,240 --> 00:51:10,200
frame that price will

882
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:15,119
touch and continue up again if it's

883
00:51:15,119 --> 00:51:18,160
going to continue

884
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,520
up so you have the supply which is a

885
00:51:21,520 --> 00:51:23,000
previous

886
00:51:23,000 --> 00:51:26,799
high that price goes to a old high that

887
00:51:26,799 --> 00:51:29,160
it goes to and it reacts from and it

888
00:51:29,160 --> 00:51:33,079
begins to go down that old

889
00:51:33,079 --> 00:51:38,079
high is the area that you want to begin

890
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:39,160
to

891
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,559
look to

892
00:51:41,559 --> 00:51:47,040
sell the market to short to

893
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:50,280
short that's what you want to look at

894
00:51:50,280 --> 00:51:54,480
that old high that's up there you want

895
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,200
to look at that

896
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:59,280
and when the market gets there and it

897
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:02,319
touches and pulls

898
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:05,960
away when it touches there and it pulls

899
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,119
away you can get into a short position

900
00:52:09,119 --> 00:52:12,119
make money and that short position

901
00:52:12,119 --> 00:52:15,920
oftentimes is heading to a

902
00:52:15,920 --> 00:52:19,920
demand so he can tap there and people

903
00:52:19,920 --> 00:52:21,440
who are

904
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:24,280
buying people who are

905
00:52:24,280 --> 00:52:26,280
buying

906
00:52:26,280 --> 00:52:29,480
they will buy from the

907
00:52:29,599 --> 00:52:33,040
demand and price will

908
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:36,280
continue now it doesn't always continue

909
00:52:36,280 --> 00:52:39,400
higher than the area that it began

910
00:52:39,400 --> 00:52:41,400
falling from the area that it tapped

911
00:52:41,400 --> 00:52:42,440
into the

912
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:45,160
supply the supply when price tapped into

913
00:52:45,160 --> 00:52:48,440
a supply it made a high on that supply

914
00:52:48,440 --> 00:52:51,319
and then it lowered price so that's a

915
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:55,400
previous High that's there that's a a

916
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,400
previous

917
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:59,760
high now some people might

918
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:03,799
say but you said the previous high is a

919
00:53:03,799 --> 00:53:08,000
supply yes I did the previous high is a

920
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:11,520
supply absolutely

921
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:18,680
correct but in a trend moving

922
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:22,359
up price can tap into the previous

923
00:53:22,359 --> 00:53:24,720
Supply and give you a little movement

924
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:26,280
away from

925
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,599
it but then it can

926
00:53:29,599 --> 00:53:34,599
continue so you got into a sell position

927
00:53:34,760 --> 00:53:38,440
here you got into a sell position here

928
00:53:38,440 --> 00:53:42,280
to try and sell the market down or short

929
00:53:42,280 --> 00:53:44,720
the market and it went down just a

930
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:47,079
little

931
00:53:47,720 --> 00:53:50,440
bit was a little

932
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:54,160
profit but then it came back

933
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:56,559
to

934
00:53:56,559 --> 00:53:58,839
the area that you were willing to close

935
00:53:58,839 --> 00:54:01,760
if you started losing too

936
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:06,599
much which is called your stop

937
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:10,520
loss or where your stop loss should

938
00:54:10,520 --> 00:54:13,160
be so you're looking

939
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:19,520
to get in right here and sell the market

940
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:25,839
down and you're willing to get out here

941
00:54:25,839 --> 00:54:30,720
if you were wrong about the

942
00:54:30,760 --> 00:54:34,799
position if you were wrong about the

943
00:54:34,799 --> 00:54:39,280
position so this

944
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:43,240
Supply helps you to

945
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:45,839
determine it helps you to

946
00:54:45,839 --> 00:54:48,920
determine if your trade goes in the

947
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:52,119
opposite direction and you are losing

948
00:54:52,119 --> 00:54:56,559
money the end of this Supply the top of

949
00:54:56,559 --> 00:54:59,160
this old

950
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,280
high it's where you're getting out it's

951
00:55:02,280 --> 00:55:05,640
where you're stop losses it's where you

952
00:55:05,640 --> 00:55:11,520
say I was wrong you guys hear me I was

953
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:14,760
wrong I was

954
00:55:14,760 --> 00:55:19,280
wrong about price going down and this is

955
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:21,799
where I'm willing to maintain my

956
00:55:21,799 --> 00:55:24,000
stance on

957
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:26,920
price going down until I

958
00:55:26,920 --> 00:55:29,760
reverse my bias until I shift it until I

959
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,559
change it I was wrong about that area

960
00:55:32,559 --> 00:55:34,960
now just because you changed your bias

961
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:36,240
and

962
00:55:36,240 --> 00:55:39,079
price put you in draw down and you lost

963
00:55:39,079 --> 00:55:41,200
your

964
00:55:41,200 --> 00:55:43,359
money that doesn't mean that you

965
00:55:43,359 --> 00:55:46,400
automatically jump into another trade

966
00:55:46,400 --> 00:55:48,720
and try to go up with

967
00:55:48,720 --> 00:55:52,400
it that doesn't mean

968
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:55,559
that because if you jump into a trade

969
00:55:55,559 --> 00:55:58,319
and you try to go up with

970
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,400
it and price was

971
00:56:02,839 --> 00:56:05,920
only going a little bit up above the

972
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:08,599
previous High into the supply again

973
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:10,240
remember the supply that was back here

974
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:11,799
the scent price

975
00:56:11,799 --> 00:56:14,000
down and there was a supply that was

976
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:16,599
created here but this is not the supply

977
00:56:16,599 --> 00:56:18,440
you're looking to sell from this is a

978
00:56:18,440 --> 00:56:21,000
supply that will give you a reaction yes

979
00:56:21,000 --> 00:56:22,799
but it's not something you're looking to

980
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:25,000
sell and hold until you go all the way

981
00:56:25,000 --> 00:56:26,960
down

982
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,760
here

983
00:56:28,760 --> 00:56:32,359
unless something happens here in this

984
00:56:32,359 --> 00:56:33,720
particular

985
00:56:33,720 --> 00:56:37,200
area sorry in this particular

986
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,240
area to let you know that price is going

987
00:56:41,240 --> 00:56:45,720
down now that's a type of pattern or

988
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:50,000
movement that the candlesticks will show

989
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:53,880
you likewise when you get here into the

990
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:57,640
demand there's a pattern that the

991
00:56:57,640 --> 00:57:01,440
candlesticks form most

992
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:05,160
times that will let you know that we're

993
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:08,440
turning around from

994
00:57:08,440 --> 00:57:14,440
here and we're going back up where

995
00:57:14,440 --> 00:57:19,160
where up to where we came from

996
00:57:19,160 --> 00:57:22,160
or

997
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:25,319
or sorry this is my

998
00:57:25,319 --> 00:57:27,200
this won't let me be great come on move

999
00:57:27,200 --> 00:57:29,240
out of here

1000
00:57:29,240 --> 00:57:31,880
or we're going where we to where we came

1001
00:57:31,880 --> 00:57:38,760
from or we're going beyond that but that

1002
00:57:38,760 --> 00:57:42,680
decision doesn't happen here in the

1003
00:57:42,680 --> 00:57:47,359
middle of the market that happens at the

1004
00:57:47,359 --> 00:57:52,280
low which is at a former

1005
00:57:52,559 --> 00:57:55,319
low or that happens

1006
00:57:55,319 --> 00:57:57,119
at the

1007
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:00,200
high which is at a

1008
00:58:00,200 --> 00:58:03,520
former High a

1009
00:58:03,520 --> 00:58:08,160
former High a former

1010
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,359
Supply or a

1011
00:58:10,359 --> 00:58:12,799
former

1012
00:58:12,799 --> 00:58:17,839
demand so the best places for you to get

1013
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:20,119
involved in a trade when you're going to

1014
00:58:20,119 --> 00:58:23,319

only at an

1017
00:58:29,599 --> 00:58:32,960
area of

1018
00:58:38,760 --> 00:58:42,400
Supply an area of

1019
00:58:43,160 --> 00:58:46,160
Supply or an area

1020
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:49,039
of

1021
00:58:49,039 --> 00:58:51,720
demand

1022
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,559

from it came from this area down

1049
01:00:23,559 --> 01:00:26,240
below

1050
01:00:26,240 --> 01:00:29,839
and more importantly write this

1051
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:32,240
down write this down because this is

1052
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:34,000
where it changes this is for people who

1053
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,880
do not understand charting at all this

1054
01:00:36,880 --> 01:00:41,319
is where it changes write this

1055
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:46,640
down it came from here yes this is where

1056
01:00:46,640 --> 01:00:49,599
the market pivoted and turned and went

1057
01:00:49,599 --> 01:00:54,720
up right we see that we clearly see that

1058
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:56,359
if you guys are think if you guys think

1059
01:00:56,359 --> 01:00:57,799

alone

1062
01:01:01,680 --> 01:01:07,039
so let me um actually bring this down so

1063
01:01:07,039 --> 01:01:08,599
it's not in the way

1064
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:12,799
of the U meeting

1065
01:01:13,640 --> 01:01:16,960
controls there we

1066
01:01:20,520 --> 01:01:23,240
go yeah I hope this doesn't no this is

1067
01:01:23,240 --> 01:01:26,440
probably going to bother somebody

1068
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:30,079
um oh I can just do

1069
01:01:30,200 --> 01:01:32,680
this right yeah I just wanted to get to

1070
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:35,400
this button back

1071
01:01:37,760 --> 01:01:40,760
here

1072
01:01:41,960 --> 01:01:45,480
so in this whole move up in this whole

1073
01:01:45,480 --> 01:01:49,280
move that's going up this this white

1074
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,000
this white line right

1075
01:01:51,000 --> 01:01:53,279
here this white line right here this

1076
01:01:53,279 --> 01:01:55,480
whole move that's going

1077
01:01:55,480 --> 01:01:59,520
up you're not looking to get in there

1078
01:01:59,520 --> 01:02:02,720
you're not looking to to buy

1079
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:05,400
there you're looking to buy when the

1080
01:02:05,400 --> 01:02:10,480
market comes back to where it came

1081
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:12,200
from

1082
01:02:12,200 --> 01:02:16,920
or you're looking to sell the

1083
01:02:17,839 --> 01:02:21,880
market from where it previously came

1084
01:02:21,880 --> 01:02:25,720
from some area

1085
01:02:25,720 --> 01:02:28,359
where it's going to on the higher time

1086
01:02:28,359 --> 01:02:32,200
frame but often times that area that

1087
01:02:32,200 --> 01:02:34,839
you're looking to sell from if you want

1088
01:02:34,839 --> 01:02:38,359
more in your sell if you want more money

1089
01:02:38,359 --> 01:02:40,760
when you're selling when you're shorting

1090
01:02:40,760 --> 01:02:43,119
if you want more value when you're

1091
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:45,680
selling when you're

1092
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,279
shorting you would be

1093
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:56,200
shorting from some out hourly area

1094
01:02:56,200 --> 01:02:58,960
that's back

1095
01:02:59,720 --> 01:03:04,240
here the hourly area back here where

1096
01:03:04,240 --> 01:03:06,039
price came

1097
01:03:06,039 --> 01:03:09,559
from from the hourly this is where price

1098
01:03:09,559 --> 01:03:10,559
came

1099
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:13,359
from if you want to hold on to a long

1100
01:03:13,359 --> 01:03:15,039
move just like if you want to hold on to

1101
01:03:15,039 --> 01:03:17,520
a long

1102
01:03:17,720 --> 01:03:20,240
move and price is coming from a

1103
01:03:20,240 --> 01:03:23,240
particular area you want to hold on to a

1104
01:03:23,240 --> 01:03:27,160
long Buy if it's from a demand that's on

1105
01:03:27,160 --> 01:03:30,039
a higher time frame and you want to hold

1106
01:03:30,039 --> 01:03:31,839
on to a long

1107
01:03:31,839 --> 01:03:35,599
sell or long

1108
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,520
short if price is being

1109
01:03:40,520 --> 01:03:42,880
rejected right

1110
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:46,319
here from a higher time

1111
01:03:46,319 --> 01:03:49,079
frame area that's where you're looking

1112
01:03:49,079 --> 01:03:52,000
to sell and hold this is where you're

1113
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:53,680
looking the demand is where you're

1114
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,760
looking to to buy and

1115
01:03:55,760 --> 01:03:57,760
hold

1116
01:03:57,760 --> 01:04:00,880
right sell and

1117
01:04:00,880 --> 01:04:04,760
hold Buy and

1118
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:07,760
Hold

1119
01:04:07,760 --> 01:04:12,200
right so the supply is always above a

1120
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:15,079
former High a previous High and the

1121
01:04:15,079 --> 01:04:19,319
demand is always below a previous

1122
01:04:19,319 --> 01:04:22,640
low a former

1123
01:04:22,640 --> 01:04:25,279
low and you're only looking to buy and

1124
01:04:25,279 --> 01:04:28,400
sell from those areas but somebody

1125
01:04:28,400 --> 01:04:30,880
somebody would ask the

1126
01:04:30,880 --> 01:04:34,680
question somebody ask the

1127
01:04:35,039 --> 01:04:38,880
question what if we

1128
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:43,480
have I'm G to make

1129
01:04:44,680 --> 01:04:48,400
this what if we

1130
01:04:53,160 --> 01:04:56,160
have

1131
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:02,640
what if we have a bunch of

1132
01:05:03,039 --> 01:05:05,839
lows what if we have a let me just make

1133
01:05:05,839 --> 01:05:08,039

1144
01:05:44,680 --> 01:05:46,920
would

1145
01:05:48,279 --> 01:05:50,880
say that on the one

1146
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:56,079
minute there's a bunch of lows

1147
01:05:57,440 --> 01:05:58,680
do this

1148
01:05:58,680 --> 01:06:02,200

of

1151
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:08,279
lows so when

hour is now heading down from the supply

1156
01:06:19,839 --> 01:06:21,839
that it tapped into

1157
01:06:21,839 --> 01:06:24,599
above and price is now heading down on

1158
01:06:24,599 --> 01:06:26,640
the one minute and on the five minute on

1159
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,279

1168
01:06:59,440 --> 01:07:01,799
down moves all of these demands these

1169
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:03,920
are little demand zones many demand

1170
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:06,480
zones you see all of these demand here

1171
01:07:06,480 --> 01:07:08,520
demand here demand here demand here

1172
01:07:08,520 --> 01:07:11,920
demand here those are all of those areas

1173
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,480
are demand zones on the lower time

1174
01:07:14,480 --> 01:07:18,480
frame all of them are demand

1175
01:07:18,480 --> 01:07:22,920
zones every single low here is a demand

1176
01:07:22,920 --> 01:07:25,920
Zone

1177
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,799
on a lower time frame so as price is

1178
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:31,400
going

1179
01:07:31,400 --> 01:07:35,599
down as price is going down this is why

1180
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:39,760
you have price going down in a

1181
01:07:39,760 --> 01:07:42,559
series sorry let me just delete this

1182
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:44,160
real

1183
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:46,319
quick oh no actually I didn't have to

1184
01:07:46,319 --> 01:07:49,079
delete that I just got to make the line

1185
01:07:49,079 --> 01:07:51,240
bigger you can tell this was impr promp

1186
01:07:51,240 --> 01:07:55,920
2 I'm not even ready for it

1187
01:07:56,599 --> 01:07:59,279
so on

1188
01:08:00,279 --> 01:08:03,200
these on these highs and lows that the

1189
01:08:03,200 --> 01:08:05,559
market is making you you see these this

1190
01:08:05,559 --> 01:08:08,400
red line that's going down where I said

1191
01:08:08,400 --> 01:08:11,279
you could both you could buy from the

1192
01:08:11,279 --> 01:08:15,079
the the low to go up or you could sell

1193
01:08:15,079 --> 01:08:17,679
from the high to go down in a downtrend

1194
01:08:17,679 --> 01:08:20,600
right in a downtrend in a downtrend get

1195
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:24,120
that in your head you're buying temporar

1196
01:08:24,120 --> 01:08:27,640
in a downtrend in specific areas that

1197
01:08:27,640 --> 01:08:29,279
you can get a little bit of something

1198
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:32,960
and get out if you're scalping if you

1199
01:08:32,960 --> 01:08:36,279
are if you're scalping and you're

1200
01:08:36,279 --> 01:08:39,399
like what if this what if price is

1201
01:08:39,399 --> 01:08:42,679
coming down and it just goes straight

1202
01:08:42,679 --> 01:08:44,120
through

1203
01:08:44,120 --> 01:08:50,719
this can price do that yes the answer is

1204
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:52,799
yes

1205
01:08:52,799 --> 01:08:57,480
yes it can

1206
01:08:57,520 --> 01:09:02,279
yes these these lows on the one

1207
01:09:02,960 --> 01:09:05,198
minute even though there's times where

1208
01:09:05,198 --> 01:09:08,000
you could buy from it are there times

1209
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:12,799
where price can go St through it

1210
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:15,759
yes price

1211
01:09:15,759 --> 01:09:18,040
can

1212
01:09:18,040 --> 01:09:22,880
why because the overall trend that price

1213
01:09:22,880 --> 01:09:28,040
is currently in from the higher time

1214
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:31,120
frame is

1215
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,158
short and it is short to get down to a

1216
01:09:35,158 --> 01:09:39,278
particular area on the

1217
01:09:41,399 --> 01:09:45,319
hourly before it begins to

1218
01:09:45,319 --> 01:09:47,158
go

1219
01:09:47,158 --> 01:09:50,000
long

1220
01:09:50,000 --> 01:09:55,719
again before it begins to go long again

1221
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,880
so you're having these series of highs

1222
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:02,880
and lows that are coming

1223
01:10:02,880 --> 01:10:05,480
down but it's only coming to a

1224
01:10:05,480 --> 01:10:08,719
particular area on the higher time frame

1225
01:10:08,719 --> 01:10:11,600
to then

1226
01:10:11,600 --> 01:10:14,320
reverse so on the lower time frame if

1227
01:10:14,320 --> 01:10:16,320
you're somebody who's who's trading and

1228
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:18,040
you want a bunch of opportunities to be

1229
01:10:18,040 --> 01:10:20,120
able to get in and out of Trades I'm in

1230
01:10:20,120 --> 01:10:21,600
for a little bit out for a little bit in

1231
01:10:21,600 --> 01:10:22,880
for a little bit out for a little bit in

1232
01:10:22,880 --> 01:10:24,560
for you know like like well not in for a

1233
01:10:24,560 --> 01:10:26,920
little bit out for a little bit but in

1234
01:10:26,920 --> 01:10:29,360
for a little

1235
01:10:29,360 --> 01:10:33,080
bit in for a little bit take my profit

1236
01:10:33,080 --> 01:10:34,679
and I'm out in for a little bit take my

1237
01:10:34,679 --> 01:10:36,280
profit I'm out in for a little bit take

1238
01:10:36,280 --> 01:10:38,719
my profit I'm out on the one minute on

1239
01:10:38,719 --> 01:10:40,920
the five minute on the 15 minute

1240
01:10:40,920 --> 01:10:43,360
throughout the entire trading day while

1241
01:10:43,360 --> 01:10:45,520
the market is open it's going to be

1242
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:49,159
making highs and lows and highs and lows

1243
01:10:49,159 --> 01:10:52,320
and highs and lows and highs and lows

1244
01:10:52,320 --> 01:10:54,159
whether it's going up or whether it's

1245
01:10:54,159 --> 01:10:57,199
going down it's going to be making highs

1246
01:10:57,199 --> 01:10:59,400
and lows and highs and lows and highs

1247
01:10:59,400 --> 01:11:01,560
and

1248
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,400
lows so you're not

1249
01:11:08,040 --> 01:11:12,480
chasing price going up and you're not

1250
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,360
chasing price going down you're not

1251
01:11:15,360 --> 01:11:19,360
saying oh I see

1252
01:11:19,400 --> 01:11:22,560
this this is where it tapped into right

1253
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:26,400
here this is where it tapped you're not

1254
01:11:26,400 --> 01:11:29,080
saying it tapped the the former low here

1255
01:11:29,080 --> 01:11:33,520
it ran below this this low it ran below

1256
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,760
that and came all the way to this former

1257
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:37,600
low right here maybe I should just bring

1258
01:11:37,600 --> 01:11:39,880
it

1259
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,159
here let's say it just ran

1260
01:11:47,320 --> 01:11:50,159
below that looks so ugly but I can't fix

1261
01:11:50,159 --> 01:11:53,040
it well that's the best that I could do

1262
01:11:53,040 --> 01:11:57,080
so it ran through this low right here it

1263
01:11:57,080 --> 01:11:59,560
ran through this demand Zone remember

1264
01:11:59,560 --> 01:12:02,280
the demand Zone the demand zones on the

1265
01:12:02,280 --> 01:12:04,159
one minute and on the five

1266
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:07,719
minute are not as strong as the demand

1267
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:10,000
zones that are on the higher time frame

1268
01:12:10,000 --> 01:12:12,800
that are on the one hour that are on the

1269
01:12:12,800 --> 01:12:16,320
15 hour the 15 hour 15

1270
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:20,120
minute that are on that it's it's it's

1271
01:12:20,120 --> 01:12:21,520
it's it's

1272
01:12:21,520 --> 01:12:25,760
weaker it it won't won't hold here price

1273
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:27,400
won't tap

1274
01:12:27,400 --> 01:12:31,800
here and go to the heavens

1275
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:36,480
above because on the hourly the area

1276
01:12:36,480 --> 01:12:39,800
that the hourly is looking to get

1277
01:12:39,800 --> 01:12:42,239
to is not

1278
01:12:42,239 --> 01:12:47,080
here but it's here because there's some

1279
01:12:47,080 --> 01:12:49,400
move down

1280
01:12:49,400 --> 01:12:52,960
here that is trying to come and tap into

1281
01:12:52,960 --> 01:12:54,199
and then

1282
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:56,000
continue up

1283
01:12:56,000 --> 01:12:58,840
above so on the higher time frame if

1284
01:12:58,840 --> 01:13:00,679
you're trading minute by minute you have

1285
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:05,040
to be aware of where you are in the

1286
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,880
market are you at that hourly area where

1287
01:13:08,880 --> 01:13:12,520
price is looking to reverse

1288
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:17,800
from are you there if you are then it's

1289
01:13:17,800 --> 01:13:21,560
best for you to understand that though

1290
01:13:21,560 --> 01:13:24,639
you are looking for Longs here

1291
01:13:24,639 --> 01:13:26,840
you have to

1292
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:30,840
see a particular pattern happen with the

1293
01:13:30,840 --> 01:13:32,400
candlesticks I'm going to teach that in

1294
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:35,840
a few a particular pattern that happens

1295
01:13:35,840 --> 01:13:36,880
with the

1296
01:13:36,880 --> 01:13:41,080
candlesticks you have to see that

1297
01:13:41,080 --> 01:13:48,400
happen before you begin looking for

1298
01:13:50,159 --> 01:13:54,520
buys before you begin looking for buys

1299
01:13:54,520 --> 01:13:59,320
there's a particular pattern with the

1300
01:13:59,360 --> 01:14:01,880
candlesticks that you want to

1301
01:14:01,880 --> 01:14:06,520
see so when price gets to that one hour

1302
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:10,280
area there's a particular pattern within

1303
01:14:10,280 --> 01:14:12,800
here within

1304
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:15,639
here that you want to see happen before

1305
01:14:15,639 --> 01:14:17,760
you begin to

1306
01:14:17,760 --> 01:14:22,360
look to get into buys that you believe

1307
01:14:22,360 --> 01:14:23,840
this is this is the

1308
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:26,440
point that you

1309
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:29,719
believe not that you believe sorry that

1310
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:33,440
the area that you're trading

1311
01:14:33,440 --> 01:14:37,400
from the area that you're trading

1312
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:39,880
from is

1313
01:14:39,880 --> 01:14:43,600
set to to begin to turn price around and

1314
01:14:43,600 --> 01:14:48,000
take it higher on the higher time

1315
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:51,239
frame now when price gets here you're

1316
01:14:51,239 --> 01:14:54,520
looking to buy a move and this is the

1317
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,600
move that you could look to start buying

1318
01:14:57,600 --> 01:15:01,239
to hold for a longer period of

1319
01:15:01,239 --> 01:15:05,560
time to hold for a longer period of

1320
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:10,960
time down here this is the move that

1321
01:15:10,960 --> 01:15:14,120
you're looking for now some people might

1322
01:15:14,120 --> 01:15:17,760
ask if you're on the one

1323
01:15:17,800 --> 01:15:19,960
minute how do you know whether this is

1324
01:15:19,960 --> 01:15:21,719
going to hold whether this is going to

1325
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:24,000
be the move that it goes from or whether

1326
01:15:24,000 --> 01:15:25,360
this is going to be the move that it

1327
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:27,719
comes from that's where your

1328
01:15:27,719 --> 01:15:30,679
multi-timeframe analysis comes from so

1329
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:33,159
we found what the trend was on the one

1330
01:15:33,159 --> 01:15:36,000
hour and the one hour Trend we saw that

1331
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,679
it was reversing because it tapped into

1332
01:15:38,679 --> 01:15:41,719
a demand

1333
01:15:42,320 --> 01:15:45,080
zone so it was

1334
01:15:45,080 --> 01:15:47,719
reversing and as it was reversing from

1335
01:15:47,719 --> 01:15:50,639
this hourly area on the lower time

1336
01:15:50,639 --> 01:15:52,600
frames we began to see a series of highs

1337
01:15:52,600 --> 01:15:55,440
and lows that price continues to go up

1338
01:15:55,440 --> 01:15:59,400
to the area on the higher time frame

1339
01:15:59,400 --> 01:16:03,880
that it's looking to reverse

1340
01:16:03,880 --> 01:16:07,480
from it's looking to reverse from that

1341
01:16:07,480 --> 01:16:10,600
area on the higher time frame and go

1342
01:16:10,600 --> 01:16:12,560
back to another

1343
01:16:12,560 --> 01:16:16,600
area on the lower time frame I mean

1344
01:16:16,600 --> 01:16:18,520
sorry on the higher time another area on

1345
01:16:18,520 --> 01:16:21,679
the higher time frame that it's also

1346
01:16:21,679 --> 01:16:28,280
going to reverse from again and continue

1347
01:16:28,960 --> 01:16:33,000
up so your job as a Trader and as

1348
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,679
reading these

1349
01:16:34,679 --> 01:16:40,719
charts is to look for those

1350
01:16:40,760 --> 01:16:44,600
areas that price is going to continue to

1351
01:16:44,600 --> 01:16:47,159
go up

1352
01:16:47,159 --> 01:16:51,719
from or price is going to continue to go

1353
01:16:51,719 --> 01:16:54,560
down from

1354
01:16:54,560 --> 01:16:57,120
and depending on what time frame you are

1355
01:16:57,120 --> 01:16:58,760
trading

1356
01:16:58,760 --> 01:17:01,320
on you can hold that move for a couple

1357
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:04,679
of minutes or a couple of

1358
01:17:05,159 --> 01:17:08,600
points or you could hold that move for a

1359
01:17:08,600 --> 01:17:10,800
lot of

1360
01:17:10,800 --> 01:17:13,360
points it depends on what time frame

1361
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:16,040
you're trading on so on the hourly in

1362
01:17:16,040 --> 01:17:19,800
that hourly area when price goes to tap

1363
01:17:19,800 --> 01:17:22,280
that and we look for price to turn

1364
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:24,719
around from that area you can hold that

1365
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,400
area for a lot of points coming from

1366
01:17:27,400 --> 01:17:29,360
there to go back

1367
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:33,040
to the supply you could hold that trade

1368
01:17:33,040 --> 01:17:36,960
from the demand for a lot of points from

1369
01:17:36,960 --> 01:17:39,239
the

1370
01:17:40,639 --> 01:17:43,679
hourly if it Taps into an hourly demand

1371
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:46,400
Zone and reverses to

1372
01:17:46,400 --> 01:17:50,000
continue and on the lower time frame

1373
01:17:50,000 --> 01:17:52,120
when it gets to that hourly place on the

1374
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:56,719
lower time frame there's a Candlestick

1375
01:17:56,840 --> 01:18:00,320
pattern or a Candlestick movement that

1376
01:18:00,320 --> 01:18:03,679
you want to see that should confirm to

1377
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:06,719
you it should confirm to

1378
01:18:06,719 --> 01:18:09,920
you that now you're going to begin to

1379
01:18:09,920 --> 01:18:13,719
look for buys going up so if I'm going

1380
01:18:13,719 --> 01:18:16,000
to be on the lower time frame there's

1381
01:18:16,000 --> 01:18:17,800
going to be multiple opportunities for

1382
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:21,520
those buys to get back to that

1383
01:18:21,520 --> 01:18:25,080
hourly Supply area when I'm getting in

1384
01:18:25,080 --> 01:18:27,120
on this hourly demand there's going to

1385
01:18:27,120 --> 01:18:28,400
be multiple

1386
01:18:28,400 --> 01:18:30,360
opportunities as it's going up on the

1387
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:33,120
lower time frame to get me

1388
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,000
to that

1389
01:18:35,000 --> 01:18:38,760
supply that hourly Supply from what the

1390
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:41,239
hourly

1391
01:18:41,239 --> 01:18:44,520
demand the hourly

1392
01:18:44,520 --> 01:18:48,960
Supply and let me let me actually just

1393
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:51,920
um make an hourly

1394
01:18:51,920 --> 01:18:54,920
demand

1395
01:18:59,560 --> 01:19:02,939
[Music]

1396
01:19:06,920 --> 01:19:10,199
so this is the hourly

1397
01:19:11,719 --> 01:19:14,280
demand this area here there's there's an

1398
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:16,159
hourly demand that's

1399
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:18,840
here and some people might be

1400
01:19:18,840 --> 01:19:21,639
asking well how do we know where the

1401
01:19:21,639 --> 01:19:24,480
hourly demand

1402
01:19:24,480 --> 01:19:28,639
is and and other people may

1403
01:19:28,639 --> 01:19:32,120
ask if you

1404
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:39,000
said that it's the beginning of the

1405
01:19:39,520 --> 01:19:42,760
move that price is coming back

1406
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:45,199
to somebody else might ask if you said

1407
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:46,679
it's the beginning of the move that

1408
01:19:46,679 --> 01:19:48,320
price is coming back

1409
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:51,840
to why is it that

1410
01:19:51,840 --> 01:19:55,080
Within the

1411
01:19:55,080 --> 01:19:59,560
middle price tapped there in the

1412
01:19:59,560 --> 01:20:02,960
middle and then continued to go

1413
01:20:02,960 --> 01:20:06,679
higher you might ask

1414
01:20:07,600 --> 01:20:13,000
that that's the way that the market

1415
01:20:13,880 --> 01:20:17,920
moves that's the way that the market

1416
01:20:19,120 --> 01:20:21,120
moves the

1417
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:24,760
cheeseburger in

1418
01:20:25,239 --> 01:20:30,000
the 60s 50s whenever it

1419
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:35,159
was was 25

1420
01:20:35,320 --> 01:20:39,400
cents right here 25

1421
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,120
cents it went all the way up to let

1422
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,480
let's say I don't know

1423
01:20:47,480 --> 01:20:50,239
40 50 no no no maybe maybe something

1424
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:52,560
something incremental um it went all the

1425
01:20:52,560 --> 01:20:55,480
way up to 60

1426
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:58,679
cents because Bill Gates was buying up

1427
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:03,960
all the cows and and then he just raised

1428
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:06,679
the prices you know whatever it is you

1429
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:08,639
want to

1430
01:21:08,639 --> 01:21:10,679
believe because I'm sure whatever it is

1431
01:21:10,679 --> 01:21:13,120
that that man buys in large drobes he

1432
01:21:13,120 --> 01:21:17,040
has to report on his financial

1433
01:21:17,040 --> 01:21:19,199
thing so if you want to know who's

1434
01:21:19,199 --> 01:21:22,040
buying up what just know that those

1435
01:21:22,040 --> 01:21:24,280
those people people with a lot of

1436
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,760
money they have to

1437
01:21:26,760 --> 01:21:29,880
report their um earnings and their

1438
01:21:29,880 --> 01:21:31,280
financial

1439
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:33,159
moves

1440
01:21:33,159 --> 01:21:35,679
so look into that before you believe

1441
01:21:35,679 --> 01:21:38,560
what anybody says um

1442
01:21:38,560 --> 01:21:41,440
but so we have the we have we have price

1443
01:21:41,440 --> 01:21:44,520
coming back down went from 65 cents

1444
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:49,840
above up here to back to 25

1445
01:21:49,840 --> 01:21:54,560
cents and then

1446
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:58,080
the supply chain issue happened oh my

1447
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:01,800
gosh raised it back

1448
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:07,360
up raised it back up to 50

01:22:09,639 --> 01:22:12,719
cents it brought it back to 50

1451
01:22:12,719 --> 01:22:15,280
cents and

1452
01:22:15,280 --> 01:22:21,560
then brought price back down not to 25

1453
01:22:21,560 --> 01:22:25,440
cents not to 25

1454
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,040
cents it brought price

1455
01:22:30,040 --> 01:22:31,679
down

1456
01:22:31,679 --> 01:22:36,360
to let's say 39

1457
01:22:36,360 --> 01:22:38,880
cents but it

01:22:48,360 --> 01:22:51,040
it brought us the strength of Vore said

1461
01:22:51,040 --> 01:22:55,440
no one ever the ch cheeseburger

1462
01:22:55,600 --> 01:22:59,400
definitely was in demand wow like hot

1463
01:22:59,400 --> 01:23:04,400
cakes is going so the price went

1464
01:23:04,560 --> 01:23:08,360
up but when the price pulled back

1465
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:11,920
down the people who

1466
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:16,239
missed this opportunity

1467
01:23:18,000 --> 01:23:20,000
here have an

1468
01:23:20,000 --> 01:23:23,120
opportunity to get in again

1469
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,440
before it begins to head

1470
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,080
up before it begins to head up if

1471
01:23:30,080 --> 01:23:33,440
if if it's something that's going to be

1472
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:38,280
a part of our future if it's something

1473
01:23:38,280 --> 01:23:42,320
that's going to have value within the

1474
01:23:42,320 --> 01:23:45,639
future and that value is not

1475
01:23:45,639 --> 01:23:48,800
determined by if they say that they're

1476
01:23:48,800 --> 01:23:51,520
going to create a robot that's going to

1477
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:53,800
cook every everything you ever want and

1478
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:55,960
you never have to go food shopping

1479
01:23:55,960 --> 01:23:58,159
again because the robot is just going to

1480
01:23:58,159 --> 01:24:00,800
be able to generate all of it out of

1481
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:05,800
thin air and and when it comes time in

1482
01:24:05,800 --> 01:24:06,880
case of

1483
01:24:06,880 --> 01:24:11,080
emergencies it can deliver your baby too

1484
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,600
it can deliver your baby

1485
01:24:13,600 --> 01:24:17,520
too but it it doesn't stop there it

1486
01:24:17,520 --> 01:24:19,800
doesn't stop

1487
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:22,120
there and all of these things are being

1488
01:24:22,120 --> 01:24:24,120
said

1489
01:24:24,120 --> 01:24:29,280
said and the price is going higher

1490
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,320
geez goodness on I remember when it was

1491
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:40,239

1498
01:25:01,280 --> 01:25:03,639
just got involved

1499
01:25:03,639 --> 01:25:06,000
again and and none of those prices are

1500
01:25:06,000 --> 01:25:08,679
related to anything that that government

1501
01:25:08,679 --> 01:25:10,000
is doing so I don't know why we even

1502
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:13,199
talking about that it goes up

1503
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,320
again it goes up again if any if

1504
01:25:16,320 --> 01:25:17,840
anybody's new to this Channel and this

1505
01:25:17,840 --> 01:25:19,639
is the first video first video you're

1506
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:21,280
watching

1507
01:25:21,280 --> 01:25:25,119
welcome it goes up

1508
01:25:25,320 --> 01:25:30,880
again it goes back to the former area

1509
01:25:30,880 --> 01:25:32,520
that it was

1510
01:25:32,520 --> 01:25:37,480
in it was it was highly valued

1511
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:41,800
and goes to that area and what prices

1512
01:25:41,800 --> 01:25:43,880
begin to fall

1513
01:25:43,880 --> 01:25:46,760
again because at this

1514
01:25:46,760 --> 01:25:50,719
area there's more

1515
01:25:50,840 --> 01:25:55,119
Supply there more more Supply

1516
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:58,960
here then there is the

1517
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:00,840
current

1518
01:26:00,840 --> 01:26:05,480
demand that's going up the demand for

1519
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:09,440
it it's started to

1520
01:26:15,719 --> 01:26:19,679
weaken the demand for

1521
01:26:21,199 --> 01:26:24,000
it

1522
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,719
every time we were going up on the

1523
01:26:28,960 --> 01:26:32,719
hourly the demand for it would

1524
01:26:32,719 --> 01:26:34,280
get

1525
01:26:34,280 --> 01:26:38,840
stronger and stronger and stronger and

1526
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:42,000
every time price pull back just a little

01:26:47,600 --> 01:26:50,679
and then make the rest of

1530
01:26:51,199 --> 01:26:54,199
them

1531
01:26:55,440 --> 01:26:59,440

1532
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,560

01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:45,080
this sorry

1557
01:28:51,000 --> 01:28:52,520
actually

1558
01:28:52,520 --> 01:28:55,080
what is

1559
01:28:55,080 --> 01:28:58,119
oh so the the prices are still going up

1560
01:28:58,119 --> 01:28:59,639
here like this you see it's still going

1561
01:28:59,639 --> 01:29:02,119
up the green boxes this is the

1562
01:29:02,119 --> 01:29:04,960
demand the demand is still sending price

1563
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:07,320
higher people are still involved people

1564
01:29:07,320 --> 01:29:10,360
are still buying that's why it keeps

1565
01:29:10,360 --> 01:29:13,440
going up it keeps going up sometimes it

1566
01:29:13,440 --> 01:29:15,679
comes back and touches the previous area

1567
01:29:15,679 --> 01:29:19,159
right here and sometimes it doesn't

1568
01:29:19,159 --> 01:29:22,000
right here sometimes it doesn't even

1569
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:23,840
come back and touch the demand down here

1570
01:29:23,840 --> 01:29:26,880
because it's so strong so much buying is

1571
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,119
going on pushing price

1572
01:29:30,119 --> 01:29:34,080
higher I started with this saying that

1573
01:29:34,080 --> 01:29:36,800
what happens if we continue to

1574
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,199
push and the market doesn't pull back

1575
01:29:40,199 --> 01:29:43,239
it's an unstable

1576
01:29:43,239 --> 01:29:45,800
Market the reason why we pull back is

1577
01:29:45,800 --> 01:29:47,760
because we are creating a structure in

1578
01:29:47,760 --> 01:29:50,800
the market and that structure is

1579
01:29:50,800 --> 01:29:52,560
creating stability

1580
01:29:52,560 --> 01:29:55,480
for the market now the market is not

1581
01:29:55,480 --> 01:29:57,960
perfect So within the market a lot of

1582
01:29:57,960 --> 01:30:00,239
the times you have price push push push

1583
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,199
push push and and don't pull back guess

1584
01:30:03,199 --> 01:30:06,159
what that just means that it's primed

1585
01:30:06,159 --> 01:30:08,639
for a huge pullback

1586
01:30:08,639 --> 01:30:12,400
into a previous demand but what has to

1587
01:30:12,400 --> 01:30:17,239
happen first what has to happen

1588
01:30:18,880 --> 01:30:23,840
first what if the supply was here

1589
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:30,760
because there are certain days where

1590
01:30:30,760 --> 01:30:33,600
news takes

1591
01:30:37,159 --> 01:30:41,480
place and it pushes the market

1592
01:30:47,239 --> 01:30:50,440
up what if we come above this Supply

1593
01:30:50,440 --> 01:30:53,840
right here

1594
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:01,040
we come up above this Supply right

1595
01:31:03,239 --> 01:31:05,840
here like whatever it is here we come up

1596
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,920
above it we break through it we break

1597
01:31:07,920 --> 01:31:09,639
through that

1598
01:31:09,639 --> 01:31:13,920
supply and then you see a start to pull

1599
01:31:13,920 --> 01:31:16,360
back you see a start to pull back into

1600
01:31:16,360 --> 01:31:18,520
the

1601
01:31:18,679 --> 01:31:21,920
demand and the next Supply is all the

1602
01:31:21,920 --> 01:31:24,360
way up

1603
01:31:27,000 --> 01:31:29,719
here can the market go

1604
01:31:29,719 --> 01:31:33,719
here Will the Market go

1605
01:31:33,719 --> 01:31:37,920
here there's a possibility that it

1606
01:31:37,920 --> 01:31:40,840
can yes there's a possibility that price

1607
01:31:40,840 --> 01:31:43,920
can just stop here and start to go all

1608
01:31:43,920 --> 01:31:45,760
the way down

1609
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:48,600
here if the market is going all the way

1610
01:31:48,600 --> 01:31:51,800
down here and now it's going below the

1611
01:31:51,800 --> 01:31:54,480
the previous area it came

1612
01:31:54,480 --> 01:31:58,080
from that's telling you on a higher time

1613
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,360
frame that now the market is in a higher

1614
01:32:01,360 --> 01:32:02,840
time

1615
01:32:02,840 --> 01:32:05,280
frame bearish

1616
01:32:05,280 --> 01:32:07,520
Trend but

1617
01:32:07,520 --> 01:32:11,560
currently this higher time

1618
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:15,600
frame is a bullish

1619
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:22,320
one healthy pullback continuation above

1620
01:32:22,320 --> 01:32:26,560
how do we know when the market is in the

1621
01:32:26,560 --> 01:32:30,080
higher time frame is in a

1622
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:32,280
downtrend when the higher time frame is

1623
01:32:32,280 --> 01:32:34,639
in a

1624
01:32:35,199 --> 01:32:38,560
downtrend that higher time frame the

1625
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:40,280
structure the candlesticks that are

1626
01:32:40,280 --> 01:32:44,880
going down will end up going below you

1627
01:32:44,880 --> 01:32:47,400
see this area right

1628
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:50,639
here this area let me

1629
01:32:50,639 --> 01:32:55,960
um Circle it what um see what color

1630
01:32:55,960 --> 01:32:58,440
something

1631
01:33:01,960 --> 01:33:06,760
bright yeah I guess so

1632
01:33:06,760 --> 01:33:09,960
here this is where the market went down

1633
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:15,080
on the hourly and it pivoted up

1634
01:33:15,159 --> 01:33:18,480
right so if the market comes back to

1635
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:21,159
this area often times it'll come back to

1636
01:33:21,159 --> 01:33:24,639
this area give a healthy

1637
01:33:25,320 --> 01:33:28,600
pullback and

1638
01:33:29,960 --> 01:33:33,520
then then you'll see it continue

1639
01:33:33,520 --> 01:33:35,639
above then you'll see it continue above

1640
01:33:35,639 --> 01:33:39,320
like that give it healthy

1641
01:33:39,320 --> 01:33:41,600
pullback and

1642
01:33:41,600 --> 01:33:43,320
continue that's if it's going to

1643
01:33:43,320 --> 01:33:45,360
continue its

1644
01:33:45,360 --> 01:33:47,840
uptrend but if the market is breaking

1645
01:33:47,840 --> 01:33:49,960
down not a lot of people are buying

1646
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,880
whatever whatever it is what whatever it

1647
01:33:51,880 --> 01:33:54,719
is that's happening when the market runs

1648
01:33:54,719 --> 01:33:58,000
its former low the former low that it

1649
01:33:58,000 --> 01:33:59,760
put in when it put in the high the

1650
01:33:59,760 --> 01:34:02,719
former low the former demand when the

1651
01:34:02,719 --> 01:34:06,719
market ruins or takes out or runs or

1652
01:34:06,719 --> 01:34:12,520
goes below the former area that it came

1653
01:34:12,679 --> 01:34:14,840
from that's the

1654
01:34:14,840 --> 01:34:17,840
first

1655
01:34:18,159 --> 01:34:22,440
sign that the market is reversing

1656
01:34:22,440 --> 01:34:25,719
and it's going to start to go

1657
01:34:26,719 --> 01:34:29,199
down it's going to start to go in a

1658
01:34:29,199 --> 01:34:31,840
downtrend and

1659
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,639
now you might be able to

1660
01:34:34,639 --> 01:34:37,639
find

1661
01:34:39,639 --> 01:34:43,840
areas where you could expect

1662
01:34:44,840 --> 01:34:48,119
price to come and tap back

1663
01:34:48,119 --> 01:34:52,400
into and then find a long longer move

1664
01:34:52,400 --> 01:34:55,719
down from the hourly time frame but when

1665
01:34:55,719 --> 01:34:57,159
does that

1666
01:34:57,159 --> 01:35:03,040
happen that happens after the low that

1667
01:35:03,040 --> 01:35:04,639
it came

1668
01:35:04,639 --> 01:35:11,159
from that happens after it is

1669
01:35:12,119 --> 01:35:15,400
violated after we run below

1670
01:35:15,400 --> 01:35:19,679
it it pulls back up into the area and

1671
01:35:19,679 --> 01:35:24,679
then provides us with a short going

1672
01:35:25,480 --> 01:35:28,639
down so this yellow line is the hourly

1673
01:35:28,639 --> 01:35:31,239
the white line could be your one minute

1674
01:35:31,239 --> 01:35:33,280
five minute 15 minute whatever it is

1675
01:35:33,280 --> 01:35:35,199
it's lower than the higher Trend that

1676
01:35:35,199 --> 01:35:36,560
you're

1677
01:35:36,560 --> 01:35:40,119
following and on that lower time frame

1678
01:35:40,119 --> 01:35:42,920
you have multiple opportunities to buy

1679
01:35:42,920 --> 01:35:46,660
buy buy buy as well as you have multiple

1680
01:35:46,660 --> 01:35:49,239
[Music]

1681
01:35:49,239 --> 01:35:54,400
opportunities to sell sell sell sell

1682
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:59,119
multiple opportunities to do it but what

1683
01:35:59,119 --> 01:36:02,440
they have to be in

1684
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:07,080
areas that you could expect price to

1685
01:36:07,080 --> 01:36:10,639
reverse from and

1686
01:36:13,199 --> 01:36:15,960
continue you could expect price to

1687
01:36:15,960 --> 01:36:17,360
reverse

1688
01:36:17,360 --> 01:36:20,320
from and

1689
01:36:20,320 --> 01:36:26,280
continue these areas are areas of

1690
01:36:26,280 --> 01:36:31,119
supply and areas of

1691
01:36:31,119 --> 01:36:34,480
demand areas of

1692
01:36:34,480 --> 01:36:38,520
supply and areas of

1693
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:41,480
demand

1694
01:36:41,480 --> 01:36:44,880
so just

1695
01:36:45,280 --> 01:36:49,560
because a demand is created down here on

1696
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:50,280
the

1697
01:36:50,280 --> 01:36:53,679
hourly doesn't mean that price is going

1698
01:36:53,679 --> 01:36:56,440
to it has to come down here

1699
01:36:56,440 --> 01:36:59,320
no it does not have to come down here

1700
01:36:59,320 --> 01:37:04,600
price can go here price can stop right

1701
01:37:05,760 --> 01:37:09,000
here and continue higher like

1702
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:12,400
that because of well well that's usually

1703
01:37:12,400 --> 01:37:16,880
after a high is put in and the this is

1704
01:37:16,880 --> 01:37:20,560
rant we took the high we ran above the

1705
01:37:20,560 --> 01:37:21,719
former High

1706
01:37:21,719 --> 01:37:23,800
so we're not looking for for any sells

1707
01:37:23,800 --> 01:37:25,600
or any rejections we came above the

1708
01:37:25,600 --> 01:37:27,400
former

1709
01:37:27,400 --> 01:37:30,080
high and if you're trending up and you

1710
01:37:30,080 --> 01:37:33,000
tapped into a demand Zone

1711
01:37:33,000 --> 01:37:36,360
below we're expecting the demand Zone

1712
01:37:36,360 --> 01:37:40,560
below the last area

1713
01:37:40,560 --> 01:37:43,760
below the price came from we're

1714
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:45,679
expecting

1715
01:37:45,679 --> 01:37:50,199
that from here to put in a new

1716
01:37:50,199 --> 01:37:53,199
high

1717
01:37:54,119 --> 01:37:58,280
above where the previous

1718
01:37:58,280 --> 01:38:01,520
High came

1719
01:38:02,960 --> 01:38:05,520
from or or where sorry where where the

1720
01:38:05,520 --> 01:38:08,400
low where the low came

1721
01:38:08,400 --> 01:38:14,400
from so this low here came from this

1722
01:38:14,400 --> 01:38:16,599
high

1723
01:38:16,599 --> 01:38:19,639
here so as we begin to make our way back

1724
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:24,440
up we're looking for price to come up to

1725
01:38:24,440 --> 01:38:29,960
this high that we just came from

1726
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:34,599
why because

1727
01:38:34,599 --> 01:38:38,960
that's supply and demand if there's more

1728
01:38:38,960 --> 01:38:41,760
demand we take it to the supply and take

1729
01:38:41,760 --> 01:38:44,280
price as high as we can and when there's

1730
01:38:44,280 --> 01:38:48,119
no demand

1731
01:38:48,119 --> 01:38:51,400
there and there's more Supply present

1732
01:38:51,400 --> 01:38:52,599
the

1733
01:38:52,599 --> 01:38:55,920
value of the current thing that you're

1734
01:38:55,920 --> 01:38:59,119
trading at that supply and there's no

1735
01:38:59,119 --> 01:39:03,400
demand left there's no strong Demand

1736
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:05,280
anymore at that

1737
01:39:05,280 --> 01:39:07,920
[Music]

1738
01:39:07,920 --> 01:39:10,760
Supply you will see price start to break

1739
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:14,840
down start to shift lower to go back to

1740
01:39:14,840 --> 01:39:18,080
an area of

1741
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:23,360
demand a low a former low or a former

1742
01:39:23,360 --> 01:39:26,880
area that price came out

1743
01:39:30,480 --> 01:39:35,239
of to tap into and if there's enough

1744
01:39:35,239 --> 01:39:36,679
demand

1745
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:40,639
there guess what that demand

1746
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:44,560
does if there's enough demand

1747
01:39:44,560 --> 01:39:46,760
there that

1748
01:39:46,760 --> 01:39:50,040
demand sorry let me move this that

1749
01:39:50,040 --> 01:39:52,360
demand

1750
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:55,320
puts in a new

1751
01:39:55,639 --> 01:39:59,840
high if there's enough demand here and

1752
01:39:59,840 --> 01:40:02,719
you still have people waiting to get

1753
01:40:02,719 --> 01:40:04,400
back to

1754
01:40:04,400 --> 01:40:08,679
here but there was enough demand

1755
01:40:08,679 --> 01:40:11,679
here and somebody might be like how do

1756
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,599
you know that there's enough demand

1757
01:40:13,599 --> 01:40:17,719
there because when you get

1758
01:40:17,719 --> 01:40:22,960
there on the lower time frame

1759
01:40:23,440 --> 01:40:25,760
you

1760
01:40:25,960 --> 01:40:27,880
have a

1761
01:40:27,880 --> 01:40:30,719
series of highs and

1762
01:40:30,719 --> 01:40:34,040
lows coming down sorry this is so ugly

1763
01:40:34,040 --> 01:40:35,520
let me draw something

1764
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:38,840
things you have a series

1765
01:40:38,840 --> 01:40:41,199
of

1766
01:40:41,199 --> 01:40:44,440
highs and

1767
01:40:44,800 --> 01:40:46,760
lows I don't know I don't know what's

1768
01:40:46,760 --> 01:40:49,000
going on with my drawing skills I don't

1769
01:40:49,000 --> 01:40:50,719
know is this is is the angle of this

1770
01:40:50,719 --> 01:40:53,520
like look at me like what is happening

1771
01:40:53,520 --> 01:40:55,760
it's not me it's you trading me I mean

1772
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:59,119
it's me because I drew it but

1773
01:40:59,119 --> 01:41:06,320
look we have a series of lows highs lows

1774
01:41:06,320 --> 01:41:09,199
highs lows don't worry I'm G fix it

1775
01:41:09,199 --> 01:41:13,400
highs lows highs

1776
01:41:13,400 --> 01:41:17,840
lows we have a series of that uh we we

1777
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:19,840
have a series of

1778
01:41:19,840 --> 01:41:22,840
that

1779
01:41:26,000 --> 01:41:28,400
coming

1780
01:41:29,360 --> 01:41:32,000
down series of lows and Highs coming

1781
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,360
down

1782
01:41:35,480 --> 01:41:37,599
right

1783
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:42,760
down but then so let me make this

1784
01:41:46,719 --> 01:41:49,080
red have a series of lows and Highs

1785
01:41:49,080 --> 01:41:53,679
coming down and what

1786
01:41:53,719 --> 01:41:58,520
happens me just change the color of

1787
01:42:01,000 --> 01:42:03,400
this what

1788
01:42:03,400 --> 01:42:06,159
happens when we get to that oneh hour

1789
01:42:06,159 --> 01:42:08,800
demand Zone remember we said this is

1790
01:42:08,800 --> 01:42:11,280
this is the

1791
01:42:16,320 --> 01:42:19,520
demand let's say this is the demand the

1792
01:42:19,520 --> 01:42:22,280
green box

1793
01:42:22,280 --> 01:42:26,080
when we get to that one hour demand

1794
01:42:26,080 --> 01:42:29,760
Zone that's down

1795
01:42:39,360 --> 01:42:43,360
here I apologize guys my OCD is the

1796
01:42:43,360 --> 01:42:45,679
reason why I'm so accurate so you have

1797
01:42:45,679 --> 01:42:48,280
to accept

1798
01:42:49,280 --> 01:42:52,760
it so

1799
01:42:54,480 --> 01:42:57,920
we get here to the demand

1800
01:43:01,880 --> 01:43:04,480
Zone and we're expecting price to go

1801
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:05,639
higher

1802
01:43:05,639 --> 01:43:08,400
right what are we looking to

1803
01:43:08,400 --> 01:43:11,599
happen in this demand

1804
01:43:11,599 --> 01:43:14,800
Zone if we're expecting price to go

1805
01:43:14,800 --> 01:43:18,560
higher we're looking

1806
01:43:19,679 --> 01:43:24,800
for price to go above an old high

1807
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,800
because as we're going down we're making

1808
01:43:27,800 --> 01:43:34,199
low high low high low high

1809
01:43:34,199 --> 01:43:38,400
low and then we put in a high right here

1810
01:43:38,400 --> 01:43:43,199
price moves really fast put in a

1811
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,960
high that

1812
01:43:45,960 --> 01:43:48,800
violates the former

1813
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:51,800
High remember what we said if we know we

1814
01:43:51,800 --> 01:43:54,000
we were going up in this

1815
01:43:54,000 --> 01:43:56,400
market and if we wanted to know whether

1816
01:43:56,400 --> 01:43:57,800
we were going to go down we would have

1817
01:43:57,800 --> 01:44:03,000
to violate an old low right so on the

1818
01:44:03,000 --> 01:44:05,719
lower time frames when you're

1819
01:44:05,719 --> 01:44:09,320
reversing from a higher time frame

1820
01:44:09,320 --> 01:44:13,840
demand you have the Run of a former High

1821
01:44:13,840 --> 01:44:15,760
that's

1822
01:44:15,760 --> 01:44:19,599
there when that former high is

1823
01:44:19,599 --> 01:44:24,880
ran price retraces and what you guessed

1824
01:44:24,880 --> 01:44:26,719
it

1825
01:44:26,719 --> 01:44:28,880
correct

1826
01:44:28,880 --> 01:44:31,840
continues in its uptrend maybe I need to

1827
01:44:31,840 --> 01:44:33,560
do this on an angle or something I'm

1828
01:44:33,560 --> 01:44:35,599
like what this is so

1829
01:44:35,599 --> 01:44:38,000
ugly I don't know I'm better at fixing

1830
01:44:38,000 --> 01:44:41,199
it than I am at creating

1831
01:44:44,480 --> 01:44:48,080
it so now you

1832
01:44:49,560 --> 01:44:51,920
see now you

1833
01:44:51,920 --> 01:44:56,280
see a a demand just like this now you

1834
01:44:56,280 --> 01:44:57,080
see a

1835
01:44:57,080 --> 01:45:00,719
demand just like that

1836
01:45:00,719 --> 01:45:04,119
right and sorry not not demand now now

1837
01:45:04,119 --> 01:45:06,080
you see now you see a reversal now you

1838
01:45:06,080 --> 01:45:07,920
see a reversal and the trend is moving

1839
01:45:07,920 --> 01:45:11,560
up and you see demands are being

1840
01:45:17,080 --> 01:45:19,199
created you seeing that demands are

1841
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:22,480
being created again

1842
01:45:25,239 --> 01:45:28,000
supplies are being created

1843
01:45:28,000 --> 01:45:30,599
again but these supplies that are being

1844
01:45:30,599 --> 01:45:34,840
created are tap are tapping into

1845
01:45:35,040 --> 01:45:39,040
former supplies to the

1846
01:45:39,840 --> 01:45:42,560
left taab into former supplies to the

1847
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:46,440
left former highs former areas of

1848
01:45:46,440 --> 01:45:49,679
Supply cuz the truth is you guys keep

1849
01:45:49,679 --> 01:45:51,560
hearing me say supplies at the highs and

1850
01:45:51,560 --> 01:45:53,400
lows but the supplies at the highs and

1851
01:45:53,400 --> 01:45:54,880
lows are the ones that I'm telling you

1852
01:45:54,880 --> 01:45:58,119
guys to choose because that's where the

1853
01:45:58,119 --> 01:46:00,280
the larger movement comes from within

1854
01:46:00,280 --> 01:46:01,599
the smaller

1855
01:46:01,599 --> 01:46:05,920
Trends but there are times there are

1856
01:46:05,920 --> 01:46:10,159
times where price will

1857
01:46:10,159 --> 01:46:12,280
not go back

1858
01:46:12,280 --> 01:46:15,880
to that demand

1859
01:46:18,920 --> 01:46:23,080
below it will just just go

1860
01:46:23,440 --> 01:46:25,040
right

1861
01:46:25,040 --> 01:46:28,000
here and start to continue higher just

1862
01:46:28,000 --> 01:46:30,199
like

1863
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:33,840
this it'll go right there and start to

1864
01:46:33,840 --> 01:46:36,159
continue higher so it'll go to the top

1865
01:46:36,159 --> 01:46:40,599
of the old high right here the old high

1866
01:46:40,599 --> 01:46:43,760
it'll go to the top of the old

1867
01:46:43,760 --> 01:46:48,400
high and continue up like

1868
01:46:49,199 --> 01:46:52,440
that just just like

1869
01:46:52,440 --> 01:46:57,639
that so you guys hear me saying that at

1870
01:46:57,639 --> 01:47:01,239
the bottom of the one minute

1871
01:47:01,239 --> 01:47:04,719
Trend there are demands

1872
01:47:04,719 --> 01:47:09,199
there but there are multiple

1873
01:47:11,280 --> 01:47:14,280
demands

1874
01:47:14,360 --> 01:47:18,199
within the one minute

1875
01:47:19,320 --> 01:47:22,320
trend

1876
01:47:22,440 --> 01:47:24,400
because even on the one minute Trend

1877
01:47:24,400 --> 01:47:26,280
even on the five minute Trend even on

1878
01:47:26,280 --> 01:47:29,320
the 15minute

1879
01:47:32,599 --> 01:47:36,159
trend even on the 15minute

1880
01:47:36,159 --> 01:47:40,400
trend there's also a series of highs and

1881
01:47:40,400 --> 01:47:43,440
lows in here

1882
01:47:45,679 --> 01:47:48,280
too there's also a series of highs and

1883
01:47:48,280 --> 01:47:51,199
lows in there too and that series of

1884
01:47:51,199 --> 01:47:53,639
highs and

1885
01:47:55,639 --> 01:47:59,800
lows that is provided by the

1886
01:47:59,800 --> 01:48:02,560
candlesticks that you

1887
01:48:02,560 --> 01:48:06,119
see the candlesticks that you see are

1888
01:48:06,119 --> 01:48:08,119
forming those

1889
01:48:08,119 --> 01:48:11,280
small highs and

1890
01:48:11,280 --> 01:48:14,080
lows inside of

1891
01:48:14,080 --> 01:48:19,239
it so just like on the 15

1892
01:48:19,239 --> 01:48:20,760
minute

1893
01:48:20,760 --> 01:48:24,280
where you could exp expect little areas

1894
01:48:24,280 --> 01:48:27,280
of supply for the market to tap

1895
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:31,920
into and give you a rejection back

1896
01:48:31,920 --> 01:48:36,119
down before continuing

1897
01:48:36,520 --> 01:48:39,119
higher the same way that that you have

1898
01:48:39,119 --> 01:48:41,400
that on the 15 minute is the same way

1899
01:48:41,400 --> 01:48:43,480
that you have smaller ones in there on

1900
01:48:43,480 --> 01:48:44,400
the one

1901
01:48:44,400 --> 01:48:48,560
minute so now the smaller

1902
01:48:48,719 --> 01:48:51,119
ones these small smaller ones on the one

1903
01:48:51,119 --> 01:48:53,840
minute the smaller down moves the Down

1904
01:48:53,840 --> 01:48:56,800
Candles the down areas before price

1905
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,080
continues

1906
01:48:59,080 --> 01:49:01,800
higher

1907
01:49:01,800 --> 01:49:06,520
these can give you

1908
01:49:07,760 --> 01:49:11,840
buys and cells

1909
01:49:18,040 --> 01:49:23,280
too these can give you buys and cells

1910
01:49:27,960 --> 01:49:31,480
too based

1911
01:49:33,199 --> 01:49:37,639
on the smaller areas of demand but just

1912
01:49:37,639 --> 01:49:41,000
know that those smaller areas of

1913
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:45,520
demand and the smaller areas of Supply

1914
01:49:45,520 --> 01:49:52,080
above on the one minute they don't hold

1915
01:49:52,080 --> 01:49:55,320
as much as the higher time frame ones

1916
01:49:55,320 --> 01:50:00,000
do but you can find entries here you

1917
01:50:00,000 --> 01:50:01,480
just have to understand that those

1918
01:50:01,480 --> 01:50:03,560
entries are only for a couple of points

1919
01:50:03,560 --> 01:50:06,760
or a quick move so it's a larger

1920
01:50:06,760 --> 01:50:08,880
position but a quicker move you're in

1921
01:50:08,880 --> 01:50:11,000
and out in and out that's scalping

1922
01:50:11,000 --> 01:50:13,800
that's what I teach that's what I do on

1923
01:50:13,800 --> 01:50:16,960
the the the on YouTube Every Day

1924
01:50:16,960 --> 01:50:21,159
live I show you areas that you're able

1925
01:50:21,159 --> 01:50:24,719
to get in and get out of the market

1926
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,679
using this entire way that I just

1927
01:50:27,679 --> 01:50:31,800
explained to you guys that the market is

1928
01:50:31,800 --> 01:50:35,639
structured using multiple Supply areas

1929
01:50:35,639 --> 01:50:39,119
multiple demand areas and I'm pointing

1930
01:50:39,119 --> 01:50:40,159
that

1931
01:50:40,159 --> 01:50:43,560
out with

1932
01:50:43,679 --> 01:50:47,079
what with just these

1933
01:50:47,079 --> 01:50:51,639
squares with just these squares

1934
01:50:51,639 --> 01:50:54,000
that's what I'm pointing that out with

1935
01:50:54,000 --> 01:50:56,199
these

1936
01:50:58,159 --> 01:51:00,639
squares and then you see the movement

1937
01:51:00,639 --> 01:51:02,599
happen you see the flip and now you know

1938
01:51:02,599 --> 01:51:06,239
you're looking to get involved in buys

1939
01:51:06,239 --> 01:51:09,119
but the buys you're only looking to get

1940
01:51:09,119 --> 01:51:13,480
involved in buys when the market

1941
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:18,960
flips at previous

1942
01:51:18,960 --> 01:51:20,599
demands

1943
01:51:20,599 --> 01:51:22,880
not in the middle not after price tapped

1944
01:51:22,880 --> 01:51:25,320
it and it's running up to to take out

1945
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:29,320
the high not at that time you're looking

1946
01:51:29,320 --> 01:51:34,719
to get in here when the market pulls

1947
01:51:34,719 --> 01:51:40,800
back and you want your entry to take you

1948
01:51:40,800 --> 01:51:44,079
higher because often

1949
01:51:44,079 --> 01:51:45,599
times

1950
01:51:45,599 --> 01:51:49,440
if the market is not looking to go up

1951
01:51:49,440 --> 01:51:51,520
from here

1952
01:51:51,520 --> 01:51:56,159
here you will have your entry

1953
01:51:59,280 --> 01:52:02,880
here sorry let

1954
01:52:04,520 --> 01:52:08,920
me you will have your entry

1955
01:52:11,199 --> 01:52:15,000
here you will have your stop loss

1956
01:52:15,000 --> 01:52:17,960
here your stop loss is is how much

1957
01:52:17,960 --> 01:52:20,360
you're willing to lose B based on the

1958
01:52:20,360 --> 01:52:21,840
size of your account how much you're

1959
01:52:21,840 --> 01:52:24,280
willing to lose for anybody who doesn't

1960
01:52:24,280 --> 01:52:27,440
know how much you're willing to

1961
01:52:27,440 --> 01:52:29,320
lose

1962
01:52:29,320 --> 01:52:33,320
before you get out of the trade and stop

1963
01:52:33,320 --> 01:52:36,480
your loss from going further eating into

1964
01:52:36,480 --> 01:52:37,960
the rest of your account that you

1965
01:52:37,960 --> 01:52:39,280
currently

1966
01:52:39,280 --> 01:52:41,719
have so it's how much you're willing to

1967
01:52:41,719 --> 01:52:44,800
risk right here your entry is here in

1968
01:52:44,800 --> 01:52:46,480
the middle of this

1969
01:52:46,480 --> 01:52:50,239
area your stop is behind the area that

1970
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:52,480
you're trading from behind the Zone

1971
01:52:52,480 --> 01:52:55,000
behind the zone that you're trading from

1972
01:52:55,000 --> 01:52:56,800
it's behind the

1973
01:52:56,800 --> 01:53:01,119
zone and you're looking to

1974
01:53:01,119 --> 01:53:06,000
Target potentially the new high but as

1975
01:53:06,000 --> 01:53:09,040
price is going

1976
01:53:09,400 --> 01:53:13,000
up as price is going up remember what I

1977
01:53:13,000 --> 01:53:15,360
said there's a

1978
01:53:15,360 --> 01:53:20,079
series of highs and lows in here that

1979
01:53:20,079 --> 01:53:24,040
takes you up so guess what guess what

1980
01:53:24,040 --> 01:53:25,880
with the series of highs and lows that

1981
01:53:25,880 --> 01:53:28,320
take you

1982
01:53:28,400 --> 01:53:33,159
up if price is not going to run this

1983
01:53:33,159 --> 01:53:36,159
High what it's going to look

1984
01:53:36,159 --> 01:53:40,040
like is you have these highs and lows

1985
01:53:40,040 --> 01:53:42,280
going up

1986
01:53:42,280 --> 01:53:46,199
right price stops right here at some

1987
01:53:46,199 --> 01:53:50,119
former Supply area that's there and what

1988
01:53:50,119 --> 01:53:54,880
does it do it violates one of the older

1989
01:53:54,880 --> 01:53:57,920
lows if it violates one of the older

1990
01:53:57,920 --> 01:54:00,040
lows on the one

1991
01:54:00,040 --> 01:54:03,320
minute you know the one minute cycle now

1992
01:54:03,320 --> 01:54:06,159
is getting ready to go into a

1993
01:54:06,159 --> 01:54:08,960
downtrend but for how

1994
01:54:08,960 --> 01:54:12,840
long most times it can just be going

1995
01:54:12,840 --> 01:54:14,199
back

1996
01:54:14,199 --> 01:54:18,000
to a previous area where it

1997
01:54:18,000 --> 01:54:20,280
started and it's going to continue

1998
01:54:20,280 --> 01:54:21,440
higher how do you know it's going to

1999
01:54:21,440 --> 01:54:23,480
continue higher because it's going to

2000
01:54:23,480 --> 01:54:27,280
run one of its older highs TAPS in and

2001
01:54:27,280 --> 01:54:28,800
continues like

2002
01:54:28,800 --> 01:54:33,800
that and this is how the market pivots

2003
01:54:33,800 --> 01:54:36,800
this is how the market

2004
01:54:36,800 --> 01:54:41,360
moves and this that I just mentioned the

2005
01:54:41,360 --> 01:54:45,159
way this Market chooses to

2006
01:54:48,679 --> 01:54:52,800
Pivot this that I just

2007
01:54:56,000 --> 01:54:59,480
mentioned is the Market's cycle of how

2008
01:54:59,480 --> 01:55:00,840
it goes

2009
01:55:00,840 --> 01:55:04,560
up when it

2010
01:55:04,920 --> 01:55:08,520
reverses when it

2011
01:55:09,560 --> 01:55:14,880
reverses now how it's going

2012
01:55:16,159 --> 01:55:21,599
down and when it reverses

2013
01:55:24,280 --> 01:55:27,639
to how it's going up and all I'm doing

2014
01:55:27,639 --> 01:55:29,119
on the one minute when I'm trading

2015
01:55:29,119 --> 01:55:32,400
during the during the the live sessions

2016
01:55:32,400 --> 01:55:35,679
is just tracing all of those areas that

2017
01:55:35,679 --> 01:55:38,440
price is bouncing off of to continue so

2018
01:55:38,440 --> 01:55:40,880
your entry is the bounce to

2019
01:55:40,880 --> 01:55:44,000
continue or the bounce to short the

2020
01:55:44,000 --> 01:55:46,679
bounce to go down or the bounce to go up

2021
01:55:46,679 --> 01:55:48,440
the bounce for the retracement or the

2022
01:55:48,440 --> 01:55:51,239
bounce for price to to continue going up

2023
01:55:51,239 --> 01:55:54,239
that's all it is and guess what guess

2024
01:55:54,239 --> 01:55:57,320
what how do we

2025
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:00,800
know how do we

2026
01:56:00,800 --> 01:56:04,800
know where the areas are that price is

2027
01:56:04,800 --> 01:56:06,520
going to retrace from or start to go

2028
01:56:06,520 --> 01:56:09,840
down from before it continues

2029
01:56:09,840 --> 01:56:13,159
up often times it's right near the

2030
01:56:13,159 --> 01:56:14,400
former

2031
01:56:14,400 --> 01:56:18,520
highs so when it gets to its former

2032
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:23,040
High you see it retrace

2033
01:56:23,040 --> 01:56:26,520
down and then when it gets to the former

2034
01:56:26,520 --> 01:56:29,920
area below or the the the demand one of

2035
01:56:29,920 --> 01:56:32,280
the demands that's within the smaller

2036
01:56:32,280 --> 01:56:34,840
Trend what does it

2037
01:56:34,840 --> 01:56:38,800
do it continues up so if you want to get

2038
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,440
involved in the market you can get

2039
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,599
involved in the market on a quick scalp

2040
01:56:42,599 --> 01:56:44,840
going down which is risky because it's

2041
01:56:44,840 --> 01:56:47,679
against the trend you saw the trend just

2042
01:56:47,679 --> 01:56:49,599
changed right here once we ran that

2043
01:56:49,599 --> 01:56:51,079
former

2044
01:56:51,079 --> 01:56:54,119
high so you can get involved with a

2045
01:56:54,119 --> 01:56:58,280
scalp going down that's quick but it has

2046
01:56:58,280 --> 01:57:00,079
to be at an area of

2047
01:57:00,079 --> 01:57:02,480
Supply when it's going up you can get

2048
01:57:02,480 --> 01:57:07,040
involved in any side of the market any

2049
01:57:07,040 --> 01:57:08,920
side of the

2050
01:57:08,920 --> 01:57:11,800
market that's a sell or a buy but you

2051
01:57:11,800 --> 01:57:16,920
not you must know where you are you must

2052
01:57:16,920 --> 01:57:19,719
know where you are what is the current

2053
01:57:19,719 --> 01:57:22,440
Trend Market structure that's what it is

2054
01:57:22,440 --> 01:57:24,679
what is market structure the highs and

2055
01:57:24,679 --> 01:57:27,480
lows that we're currently

2056
01:57:27,480 --> 01:57:30,119
seeing how do we know that the market is

2057
01:57:30,119 --> 01:57:32,760
still going

2058
01:57:32,760 --> 01:57:36,920
up was any lows violated here's a low

2059
01:57:36,920 --> 01:57:41,040
here's a low here's a low no lows are

2060
01:57:41,040 --> 01:57:43,960
violated yet so what are we

2061
01:57:43,960 --> 01:57:47,000
expecting we're expecting price to turn

2062
01:57:47,000 --> 01:57:50,280
back and retrace

2063
01:57:50,280 --> 01:57:52,599
and continue right and then what does

2064
01:57:52,599 --> 01:57:56,320
that create the next

2065
01:57:56,360 --> 01:57:59,520
low the next low that's there that's

2066
01:57:59,520 --> 01:58:02,880
what it creates the next low and when

2067
01:58:02,880 --> 01:58:07,679
price is ready to go down again what's

2068
01:58:07,679 --> 01:58:09,320
what are you looking for what's going to

2069
01:58:09,320 --> 01:58:11,880
happen what are you looking to

2070
01:58:11,880 --> 01:58:16,280
see you see a low violated right where

2071
01:58:16,280 --> 01:58:20,079
does that low tap into though

2072
01:58:20,079 --> 01:58:23,159
to go back up and then

2073
01:58:23,159 --> 01:58:27,239
short the low Taps into a previous

2074
01:58:27,239 --> 01:58:29,760
demand after

2075
01:58:29,760 --> 01:58:32,800
violating the old demand there's a

2076
01:58:32,800 --> 01:58:35,000
demand just below it at times that it

2077
01:58:35,000 --> 01:58:40,480
Taps into to go back up and now you're

2078
01:58:40,480 --> 01:58:41,719
looking for

2079
01:58:41,719 --> 01:58:45,159
shorts to go

2080
01:58:45,440 --> 01:58:49,800
down as the market is going back down

2081
01:58:49,800 --> 01:58:52,639
all you're looking

2082
01:58:55,400 --> 01:58:58,679
for all you're looking for is

2083
01:58:58,679 --> 01:59:01,719
opportunities Too Short

2084
01:59:01,719 --> 01:59:03,239
now

2085
01:59:03,239 --> 01:59:05,840
until

2086
01:59:05,840 --> 01:59:09,760
until you see one of your

2087
01:59:09,760 --> 01:59:12,760
highs

2088
01:59:14,599 --> 01:59:19,840
violated and now you're going long again

2089
01:59:19,840 --> 01:59:22,800
until what until what it's deja vu y'all

2090
01:59:22,800 --> 01:59:24,360
it's deja

2091
01:59:24,360 --> 01:59:27,320
vu until we see a low

2092
01:59:27,320 --> 01:59:29,880
violated and then now we're going down

2093
01:59:29,880 --> 01:59:32,639
again to where we could stop here there

2094
01:59:32,639 --> 01:59:35,079
could be some imbalance now on the

2095
01:59:35,079 --> 01:59:36,840
playlist I have a master's class

2096
01:59:36,840 --> 01:59:38,480
playlist I want you guys to watch it

2097
01:59:38,480 --> 01:59:40,560
after watching this video this will be

2098
01:59:40,560 --> 01:59:43,320
the first video on the master's class

2099
01:59:43,320 --> 01:59:45,360
playlist because everybody will have

2100
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,480
access to this information thanks to

2101
01:59:47,480 --> 01:59:50,800
Armani by the way but this will be the

2102
01:59:50,800 --> 01:59:51,679
first

2103
01:59:51,679 --> 01:59:54,360
video the the the other videos in the

2104
01:59:54,360 --> 01:59:57,480
playlist teaches you more in depth about

2105
01:59:57,480 --> 02:00:00,199
these pois and which one or point of

2106
02:00:00,199 --> 02:00:01,520
Interest that's what it's called about

2107
02:00:01,520 --> 02:00:03,599
these zones about these demands about

2108
02:00:03,599 --> 02:00:04,639
these

2109
02:00:04,639 --> 02:00:08,159
supplies it teaches you which ones you

2110
02:00:08,159 --> 02:00:11,760
could use to make more profit from

2111
02:00:11,760 --> 02:00:13,920
versus which ones you should just not

2112
02:00:13,920 --> 02:00:16,719
use and wait and and let it get to the

2113
02:00:16,719 --> 02:00:18,760
other one it teaches you that in the

2114
02:00:18,760 --> 02:00:22,880
master class playlist but you first must

2115
02:00:22,880 --> 02:00:25,320
understand how the market

2116
02:00:25,320 --> 02:00:28,520
moves and this is the

2117
02:00:28,520 --> 02:00:31,599
structure in which the market moves and

2118
02:00:31,599 --> 02:00:34,840
these different lines denote the time

2119
02:00:34,840 --> 02:00:37,079
frames that you're seeing all of these

2120
02:00:37,079 --> 02:00:39,440
highs and lows in and all of these highs

2121
02:00:39,440 --> 02:00:41,880
and lows Within These time frames are

2122
02:00:41,880 --> 02:00:44,760
areas where you can get involved in the

2123
02:00:44,760 --> 02:00:47,639
right

2124
02:00:48,119 --> 02:00:50,760
direction in the

2125
02:00:50,760 --> 02:00:53,520
right

2126
02:00:53,520 --> 02:00:56,800
direction one of the biggest issues that

2127
02:00:56,800 --> 02:00:58,239
we

2128
02:00:58,239 --> 02:01:01,960
have is being on the wrong side of the

2129
02:01:01,960 --> 02:01:03,400
market

2130
02:01:03,400 --> 02:01:07,320
why because we don't

2131
02:01:08,079 --> 02:01:12,520
know where our former Highs

2132
02:01:13,280 --> 02:01:16,320
are and we don't

2133
02:01:16,320 --> 02:01:21,040
know where our former lows are

2134
02:01:23,320 --> 02:01:28,480
and a violation of it is what gives us

2135
02:01:28,480 --> 02:01:29,679
the

2136
02:01:29,679 --> 02:01:31,199
next

2137
02:01:31,199 --> 02:01:36,320
Trend in that direction what gives us

2138
02:01:36,320 --> 02:01:38,920
the higher time frame retracement y'all

2139
02:01:38,920 --> 02:01:41,159
know the higher time frame y y'all

2140
02:01:41,159 --> 02:01:43,000
talking about you know like you want to

2141
02:01:43,000 --> 02:01:44,880
take moves on a higher time frame the

2142
02:01:44,880 --> 02:01:49,159
lower time frame will tell you when when

2143
02:01:49,159 --> 02:01:52,360
the higher time frame is pulling back

2144
02:01:52,360 --> 02:01:54,920
how because we are

2145
02:01:54,920 --> 02:01:58,599
violating one of these

2146
02:01:59,159 --> 02:02:04,000
lows we tap back in and then we

2147
02:02:04,000 --> 02:02:08,079
short and now we're

2148
02:02:08,079 --> 02:02:11,280
beginning the downtrend and you have

2149
02:02:11,280 --> 02:02:14,679
multiple opportunities to find shorts

2150
02:02:14,679 --> 02:02:17,320
why here's a banger that a lot of people

2151
02:02:17,320 --> 02:02:19,760
don't know y'all ready y'all ready

2152
02:02:19,760 --> 02:02:21,719
here's a banger that a lot of people

2153
02:02:21,719 --> 02:02:23,639
don't know now some people do some

2154
02:02:23,639 --> 02:02:26,239
people do on in my group because I teach

2155
02:02:26,239 --> 02:02:27,679
it but here's a banger that a lot of

2156
02:02:27,679 --> 02:02:29,520
people don't

2157
02:02:29,520 --> 02:02:31,440
know the

2158
02:02:31,440 --> 02:02:34,800
market if you're counting the

2159
02:02:34,800 --> 02:02:36,800
pullbacks these little these little

2160
02:02:36,800 --> 02:02:38,400
pullbacks that the market keeps going

2161
02:02:38,400 --> 02:02:41,159
back and tapping into something if you

2162
02:02:41,159 --> 02:02:44,239
count the pullbacks often times when the

2163
02:02:44,239 --> 02:02:46,239
market is pulling

2164
02:02:46,239 --> 02:02:53,199
back you get four to six pullbacks and

2165
02:02:53,199 --> 02:02:56,719
oftentimes the seventh one

2166
02:02:56,719 --> 02:02:59,520
fails the seventh one oftentimes the

2167
02:02:59,520 --> 02:03:02,040
seventh one fails sometimes I see the

2168
02:03:02,040 --> 02:03:04,280
market sometimes I see the

2169
02:03:04,280 --> 02:03:07,079
market it it it's three of them and four

2170
02:03:07,079 --> 02:03:10,480
of them happen and and then it's done it

2171
02:03:10,480 --> 02:03:12,440
it reverses how do you know when the

2172
02:03:12,440 --> 02:03:14,239
reversal is happening we just taught

2173
02:03:14,239 --> 02:03:16,880
that when the violation happens so even

2174
02:03:16,880 --> 02:03:19,560
if you're counting the

2175
02:03:19,560 --> 02:03:22,119
these you're counting these along with

2176
02:03:22,119 --> 02:03:24,239
looking for these and when you're

2177
02:03:24,239 --> 02:03:26,520
counting these is letting you know guess

2178
02:03:26,520 --> 02:03:28,079
what's coming bad

2179
02:03:28,079 --> 02:03:31,639
boy guess what's about to show up y'all

2180
02:03:31,639 --> 02:03:33,280
been waiting y'all

2181
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,480
ready and

2182
02:03:35,480 --> 02:03:37,840
usually the fourth to sixth one is

2183
02:03:37,840 --> 02:03:42,679
forming around what oh

2184
02:03:44,599 --> 02:03:46,280
goodness

2185
02:03:46,280 --> 02:03:48,880
goodness the 4 to6 is forming around

2186
02:03:48,880 --> 02:03:50,559
around the area that it's getting ready

2187
02:03:50,559 --> 02:03:52,880
to reject

2188
02:03:52,880 --> 02:03:57,679
from and begin

2189
02:03:57,960 --> 02:04:00,199
what

2190
02:04:00,199 --> 02:04:04,400
baby and begin the four to six combo

2191
02:04:04,400 --> 02:04:06,880
slice

2192
02:04:09,639 --> 02:04:13,280
again and they be running retail crazy

2193
02:04:13,280 --> 02:04:14,480
in the

2194
02:04:14,480 --> 02:04:18,079
market because retail is what what are

2195
02:04:18,079 --> 02:04:20,159
we doing

2196
02:04:20,159 --> 02:04:24,239
we trying to sell down

2197
02:04:24,320 --> 02:04:27,000
here sell down here and the market goes

2198
02:04:27,000 --> 02:04:30,040
up sell down here and the market goes up

2199
02:04:30,040 --> 02:04:32,639
sell down here and the market goes up

2200
02:04:32,639 --> 02:04:34,920
and then we try to buy up here and the

2201
02:04:34,920 --> 02:04:37,079
market goes down buy up here and the

2202
02:04:37,079 --> 02:04:39,320
market goes down buy up here and the

2203
02:04:39,320 --> 02:04:40,880
market goes

2204
02:04:40,880 --> 02:04:44,559
down what are we

2205
02:04:44,559 --> 02:04:50,760
doing when according to Market structure

2206
02:05:02,360 --> 02:05:05,000
there's a there's a way in which the

2207
02:05:05,000 --> 02:05:07,559
market

2208
02:05:09,840 --> 02:05:12,639
moves and we're trading what we think

2209
02:05:12,639 --> 02:05:15,280
and what we

2210
02:05:16,119 --> 02:05:18,960
see sorry what we're trading what we

2211
02:05:18,960 --> 02:05:21,719
think and and and what we believe we

2212
02:05:21,719 --> 02:05:24,719
see

2213
02:05:26,040 --> 02:05:29,040
but

2214
02:05:29,880 --> 02:05:33,000
but it's not what's actually happening

2215
02:05:33,000 --> 02:05:35,760
in the market it's

2216
02:05:35,760 --> 02:05:38,159
not what's

2217
02:05:38,159 --> 02:05:41,280
actually happening in the market that's

2218
02:05:41,280 --> 02:05:44,119
what I want people to understand it's

2219
02:05:44,119 --> 02:05:47,760
not what is actually happening in the

2220
02:05:47,760 --> 02:05:50,040
market

2221
02:05:50,040 --> 02:05:52,960
so there's there's types of Candlestick

2222
02:05:52,960 --> 02:05:56,040
patterns that people are at times

2223
02:05:56,040 --> 02:05:58,599
waiting for to

2224
02:05:58,599 --> 02:06:01,079
happen the types of Candlestick patterns

2225
02:06:01,079 --> 02:06:02,800
that people are waiting to

2226
02:06:02,800 --> 02:06:05,960
happen they're waiting for it to

2227
02:06:05,960 --> 02:06:08,360
happen and while they're waiting for it

2228
02:06:08,360 --> 02:06:09,920
to

2229
02:06:09,920 --> 02:06:14,239
happen they don't know where they

2230
02:06:14,719 --> 02:06:20,599
are where are you are you in a Zone

2231
02:06:21,400 --> 02:06:23,760
if you're in a Zone then yes if you're

2232
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:27,119
not in a Zone then no so if you see

2233
02:06:27,119 --> 02:06:30,320
price pushing like

2234
02:06:30,840 --> 02:06:34,199
this if you see price pushing like this

2235
02:06:34,199 --> 02:06:38,079
how dare you put in a long how how

2236
02:06:38,079 --> 02:06:43,119
Reckless are you to put in a

2237
02:06:43,119 --> 02:06:46,040
Longo when we understand that the

2238
02:06:46,040 --> 02:06:49,960
market pulls back and continues pulls

2239
02:06:49,960 --> 02:06:52,280
back and continues pulls back and

2240
02:06:52,280 --> 02:06:55,360
continues pulls back and continues pulls

2241
02:06:55,360 --> 02:06:58,920
back and continues we understand

2242
02:06:58,920 --> 02:07:03,159
that so our

2243
02:07:05,480 --> 02:07:09,040
profitability is in the

2244
02:07:14,880 --> 02:07:17,119
pullback our

2245
02:07:17,119 --> 02:07:20,920
life getting better is in the

2246
02:07:20,920 --> 02:07:24,679
pullback our hope is in the

2247
02:07:24,679 --> 02:07:28,840
pullback our dreams our Visions all the

2248
02:07:28,840 --> 02:07:32,440
things that we want is when life pulls

2249
02:07:32,440 --> 02:07:33,880
us

2250
02:07:33,880 --> 02:07:36,840
back when it pulls us down and we don't

2251
02:07:36,840 --> 02:07:39,159
understand

2252
02:07:39,159 --> 02:07:42,960
why we had a place of too much Supply we

2253
02:07:42,960 --> 02:07:46,599
had a place of too much going

2254
02:07:46,760 --> 02:07:51,159
on we had a place that was overvalued in

2255
02:07:51,159 --> 02:07:52,800
our

2256
02:07:52,800 --> 02:07:56,079
lives and the blessing was in the

2257
02:07:56,079 --> 02:07:59,079
undervalued

2258
02:08:01,440 --> 02:08:05,520
spot the undervalued

2259
02:08:06,679 --> 02:08:08,679
spot that's where it was that's where

2260
02:08:08,679 --> 02:08:10,119
the profitability

2261
02:08:10,119 --> 02:08:15,239
was so we waited for

2262
02:08:17,280 --> 02:08:20,960
that we waited for

2263
02:08:22,360 --> 02:08:27,320
that so I know that this is a lot to

2264
02:08:27,760 --> 02:08:30,920
digest um there's a lot to digest a lot

2265
02:08:30,920 --> 02:08:33,119
was taught here a lot but this is the

2266
02:08:33,119 --> 02:08:34,639
structure of the market so if you ever

2267
02:08:34,639 --> 02:08:36,760
want to know what Market structure

2268
02:08:36,760 --> 02:08:38,840
is and you want to get out of this

2269
02:08:38,840 --> 02:08:41,239
retail support and

2270
02:08:41,239 --> 02:08:43,520
resistance which retail support and

2271
02:08:43,520 --> 02:08:46,719
resistance is waiting for price to go

2272
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:50,040
below the demand

2273
02:08:50,040 --> 02:08:52,119
waiting for price to go below the demand

2274
02:08:52,119 --> 02:08:56,559
violate the demand but they're trying to

2275
02:08:56,559 --> 02:08:59,480
chase or put in

2276
02:08:59,480 --> 02:09:02,760
sales once we get the run of the demand

2277
02:09:02,760 --> 02:09:04,920
once we go below the demand they're

2278
02:09:04,920 --> 02:09:07,800
trying to put in CES right here because

2279
02:09:07,800 --> 02:09:11,159
they say that we're in a range and the

2280
02:09:11,159 --> 02:09:14,520
range consist

2281
02:09:14,520 --> 02:09:17,400
of all of the orders that's happening

2282
02:09:17,400 --> 02:09:19,079
within here

2283
02:09:19,079 --> 02:09:21,960
and they tell you that you should look

2284
02:09:21,960 --> 02:09:23,199
for a

2285
02:09:23,199 --> 02:09:26,800
sell to go below here or a buy to go

2286
02:09:26,800 --> 02:09:27,920
above

2287
02:09:27,920 --> 02:09:30,000
here when

2288
02:09:30,000 --> 02:09:33,079
that's when the market

2289
02:09:33,079 --> 02:09:35,880
reverses when the market goes below here

2290
02:09:35,880 --> 02:09:38,800
reverses and comes back into the range

2291
02:09:38,800 --> 02:09:41,239
when the market goes above here reverses

2292
02:09:41,239 --> 02:09:43,800
and comes back into the

2293
02:09:43,800 --> 02:09:47,159
range so you're not looking for an entry

2294
02:09:47,159 --> 02:09:51,320
above or below below the last Supply

2295
02:09:51,320 --> 02:09:53,920
above or the last demand below you're

2296
02:09:53,920 --> 02:09:56,079
not looking to chase the run or the

2297
02:09:56,079 --> 02:09:58,559
break out of it or or you're not looking

2298
02:09:58,559 --> 02:10:00,719
to just jump in because it's heavy

2299
02:10:00,719 --> 02:10:04,079
selling pressure after the run of a low

2300
02:10:04,079 --> 02:10:07,320
no because after the run of a low what

2301
02:10:07,320 --> 02:10:09,760
do we get what do we just

2302
02:10:09,760 --> 02:10:13,079
explain what do we just explain here

2303
02:10:13,079 --> 02:10:16,400
after the run of a low we explained that

2304
02:10:16,400 --> 02:10:22,079
after the run of a low there is what a

2305
02:10:22,119 --> 02:10:25,639
pullback so why on Earth will we be

2306
02:10:25,639 --> 02:10:29,679
chasing a cell below a demand if after

2307
02:10:29,679 --> 02:10:32,110
it went below the demand it

2308
02:10:32,110 --> 02:10:35,210
[Music]

2309
02:10:41,920 --> 02:10:44,159
pulled so I know that that's a lot to

2310
02:10:44,159 --> 02:10:45,320
take in and that's what I'm going to

2311
02:10:45,320 --> 02:10:47,960
pause for today and tomorrow I'm going

2312
02:10:47,960 --> 02:10:49,800
to take take you guys to

2313
02:10:49,800 --> 02:10:52,679
church and help you guys to understand

2314
02:10:52,679 --> 02:10:54,880
Market structure and where to get in and

2315
02:10:54,880 --> 02:10:58,639
where to get out precisely exactly but

2316
02:10:58,639 --> 02:11:00,639
you first need to understand this you

2317
02:11:00,639 --> 02:11:02,960
first need to grasp this you first need

2318
02:11:02,960 --> 02:11:05,239
to know this you first need to know get

2319
02:11:05,239 --> 02:11:08,400
it out your head the market does not run

2320
02:11:08,400 --> 02:11:09,960
on support and

2321
02:11:09,960 --> 02:11:11,840
resistance I get that that's the thing

2322
02:11:11,840 --> 02:11:13,840
we've been taught for the longest of

2323
02:11:13,840 --> 02:11:16,639
whatever and no wrong it does not run on

2324
02:11:16,639 --> 02:11:19,840
support and resistance

2325
02:11:19,840 --> 02:11:21,520
and if you wanted to classify what

2326
02:11:21,520 --> 02:11:24,280
support and resistance was there are

2327
02:11:24,280 --> 02:11:30,079
zones that you can call support and

2328
02:11:30,960 --> 02:11:33,320
resistance zones that you can call

2329
02:11:33,320 --> 02:11:34,760
support and

2330
02:11:34,760 --> 02:11:37,599
resistance and you can take that as an

2331
02:11:37,599 --> 02:11:40,440
entry from the support or that as an

2332
02:11:40,440 --> 02:11:43,199
entry from the resistance not from these

2333
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:45,320
areas that are above or below a

2334
02:11:45,320 --> 02:11:46,440
particular

2335
02:11:46,440 --> 02:11:49,159
range because that's how you get wrapped

2336
02:11:49,159 --> 02:11:51,880
up

2337
02:11:52,000 --> 02:11:54,520
quick and I'm going to teach

2338
02:11:54,520 --> 02:11:57,679
that tomorrow so I'm going to teach that

2339
02:11:57,679 --> 02:12:00,199
maybe in the in the evening should be

2340
02:12:00,199 --> 02:12:03,159
like more like 4 five no no no not four

2341
02:12:03,159 --> 02:12:05,639
five maybe like s o'clock Eastern

2342
02:12:05,639 --> 02:12:07,280
Standard Time because at least I can

2343
02:12:07,280 --> 02:12:09,239
give you guys some examples in a real

2344
02:12:09,239 --> 02:12:11,880
market right because that's what mentors

2345
02:12:11,880 --> 02:12:15,280
do that's what real teachers do in the

2346
02:12:15,280 --> 02:12:19,520
real Market they will teach you as it's

2347
02:12:19,520 --> 02:12:22,280
happening because they know what they

2348
02:12:22,280 --> 02:12:26,360
know what they know as the teacher as

2349
02:12:26,360 --> 02:12:29,679
the mentor so this is an

2350
02:12:29,679 --> 02:12:33,400
entirely spontaneous course that I just

2351
02:12:33,400 --> 02:12:35,760
went through that was amazing though I'm

2352
02:12:35,760 --> 02:12:38,960
glad I I um I got that explanation I'm

2353
02:12:38,960 --> 02:12:42,719
glad I got that in because wow that

2354
02:12:42,719 --> 02:12:43,920
that's going to help a lot of people

2355
02:12:43,920 --> 02:12:45,639
with structure and not chasing these

2356
02:12:45,639 --> 02:12:47,320
dumb areas where it's like oh my gosh we

2357
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:49,320
just went above certain area let's get

2358
02:12:49,320 --> 02:12:51,599
in now and that's the way the market is

2359
02:12:51,599 --> 02:12:53,719
designed go above a certain area come

2360
02:12:53,719 --> 02:12:56,040
back into it go above a certain area

2361
02:12:56,040 --> 02:12:58,040
come back into it go up a certain area

2362
02:12:58,040 --> 02:12:59,639
come back into it so why you chasing the

2363
02:12:59,639 --> 02:13:01,360
area to go up if it's always coming back

2364
02:13:01,360 --> 02:13:03,119
in wouldn't you find it coming back in

2365
02:13:03,119 --> 02:13:08,079
or find it coming out of

2366
02:13:13,159 --> 02:13:15,320
it hey

2367
02:13:15,320 --> 02:13:19,880
yo so yeah yeah I'm in there in there

2368
02:13:19,880 --> 02:13:23,599
there's a lot of heat um in one day um

2369
02:13:23,599 --> 02:13:26,760
you know I know other people who who um

2370
02:13:26,760 --> 02:13:28,440
dang I didn't even record this I'm so

2371
02:13:28,440 --> 02:13:30,079
upset it's just on YouTube so now it's

2372
02:13:30,079 --> 02:13:33,199
gonna have to stay on YouTube um for a

2373
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:34,360
lot of people who don't understand

2374
02:13:34,360 --> 02:13:36,559
structure who don't understand Market

2375
02:13:36,559 --> 02:13:39,840
structure you know like this this should

2376
02:13:39,840 --> 02:13:42,639
help but what I want you guys to

2377
02:13:42,639 --> 02:13:43,760
understand and this is why I'm coming

2378
02:13:43,760 --> 02:13:46,040
back to teach this tomorrow one because

2379
02:13:46,040 --> 02:13:47,480
I love talking and I love teaching but

2380
02:13:47,480 --> 02:13:49,960
two

2381
02:13:55,040 --> 02:13:57,159
because there are

2382
02:13:57,159 --> 02:14:01,040
times when the market comes below this

2383
02:14:01,040 --> 02:14:02,840
right

2384
02:14:02,840 --> 02:14:07,000
here and when it goes back

2385
02:14:07,000 --> 02:14:11,079
up it puts in another

2386
02:14:13,400 --> 02:14:15,440
high so I know we talked about the

2387
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:18,000
demands being violated but there there

2388
02:14:18,000 --> 02:14:20,639
are times where when the demand is

2389
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:24,400
violated it will put in another

2390
02:14:24,400 --> 02:14:27,840
high and it's how to avoid that so don't

2391
02:14:27,840 --> 02:14:29,840
think that just because you saw that and

2392
02:14:29,840 --> 02:14:31,599
you got that and it's like oh yeah

2393
02:14:31,599 --> 02:14:34,880
that's that's great is gonna no this is

2394
02:14:34,880 --> 02:14:36,000
the

2395
02:14:36,000 --> 02:14:38,400
bridge I've used other people as the

2396
02:14:38,400 --> 02:14:41,239
bridge in times and that was my fault

2397
02:14:41,239 --> 02:14:45,079
for bridging their garbage

2398
02:14:45,079 --> 02:14:48,040
work with this hot sauce that the Lord

2399
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:51,320
Jesus Christ gave

2400
02:14:53,559 --> 02:14:55,679
me

2401
02:14:55,679 --> 02:14:59,920
that was a mistake and this

2402
02:14:59,920 --> 02:15:04,960
here is what real Market structure is

2403
02:15:04,960 --> 02:15:07,159
this is Market structure with supply and

2404
02:15:07,159 --> 02:15:11,440
demand on multi-time frames multiple

2405
02:15:11,440 --> 02:15:14,119
time frames I gave you no candlesticks I

2406
02:15:14,119 --> 02:15:16,040
showed you nothing at all other than

2407
02:15:16,040 --> 02:15:18,559
lines and with these lines this is

2408
02:15:18,559 --> 02:15:22,159
exactly how the market moves and when I

2409
02:15:22,159 --> 02:15:24,920
come back tomorrow I'm going to show you

2410
02:15:24,920 --> 02:15:26,760
guys

2411
02:15:26,760 --> 02:15:30,360
exactly how it works

2412
02:15:30,360 --> 02:15:33,000
together with the

2413
02:15:33,000 --> 02:15:35,360
candlesticks with

2414
02:15:35,360 --> 02:15:37,679
them and we're going to work through it

2415
02:15:37,679 --> 02:15:41,239
together because then this this series

2416
02:15:41,239 --> 02:15:45,119
of structure and supply and demand will

2417
02:15:45,119 --> 02:15:48,599
go into structure the right way

2418
02:15:48,599 --> 02:15:51,360
and then swing points and then all of

2419
02:15:51,360 --> 02:15:53,000
the other stuff the Candlestick

2420
02:15:53,000 --> 02:15:54,920
structure the the little tiny

2421
02:15:54,920 --> 02:15:57,239
candlesticks are how you can time the

2422
02:15:57,239 --> 02:16:00,400
very beginning of the move and take it

2423
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:03,119
from the bottom to the top of where the

2424
02:16:03,119 --> 02:16:06,960
rest of the market will go I'm going to

2425
02:16:06,960 --> 02:16:12,360
to um explain that for you guys so um

2426
02:16:12,360 --> 02:16:14,360
you know I know I did plan to answer a

2427
02:16:14,360 --> 02:16:15,599
bunch of questions I didn't really get

2428
02:16:15,599 --> 02:16:17,199
around to it I do apologize you guys

2429
02:16:17,199 --> 02:16:19,480
know I love and I talk so much but I

2430
02:16:19,480 --> 02:16:21,480
hope this was heat for you guys I hope

2431
02:16:21,480 --> 02:16:23,520
this was a great explanation for you

2432
02:16:23,520 --> 02:16:25,440
guys um and tomorrow we're going to come

2433
02:16:25,440 --> 02:16:27,400

2434
02:16:27,400 --> 02:16:29,360
going to be fire y'all want to be there

2435
02:16:29,360 --> 02:16:30,480
I don't know if I'm GNA have it on

2436
02:16:30,480 --> 02:16:32,558
YouTube now because tomorrow is

2437
02:16:32,558 --> 02:16:34,478
essentially still going over all the

2438
02:16:34,478 --> 02:16:35,840
stuff that I went over in the rest of

2439
02:16:35,840 --> 02:16:38,599
the playlist this is just a bridge to

2440
02:16:38,599 --> 02:16:40,160
what supply and demand is and what

2441
02:16:40,160 --> 02:16:41,718
support and resistance is and then I'm

2442
02:16:41,718 --> 02:16:43,080
going to give the rest of the video on

2443
02:16:43,080 --> 02:16:46,080
how to identify supply and demand this

2444
02:16:46,080 --> 02:16:47,359
is not what support and resistance is

2445
02:16:47,359 --> 02:16:48,359
sorry this this is what support and

2446
02:16:48,359 --> 02:16:50,120
resistance is not that's what I was

2447
02:16:50,120 --> 02:16:52,879
showing you guys but what what supply

2448
02:16:52,879 --> 02:16:54,599
and demand is and what Market structure

2449
02:16:54,599 --> 02:16:56,959
is this is what I just went over with no

2450
02:16:56,959 --> 02:16:59,879
candlesticks tomorrow I will do it with

2451
02:16:59,879 --> 02:17:02,519
candlesticks so you see how this all

2452
02:17:02,519 --> 02:17:06,120
aligns together and then where it's best

2453
02:17:06,120 --> 02:17:08,359
for you to get into a trade what time

2454
02:17:08,359 --> 02:17:10,160
frames it's best to look at how to

2455
02:17:10,160 --> 02:17:12,240
correlate one time frame a higher time

2456
02:17:12,240 --> 02:17:14,439
frame with a lower time frame so you're

2457
02:17:14,439 --> 02:17:17,760
able to get that move on the lower time

2458
02:17:17,760 --> 02:17:21,040
frame and risk a little less than you

2459
02:17:21,040 --> 02:17:23,879
have to to be able to get the larger

2460
02:17:23,879 --> 02:17:25,879
time frame move because if you're

2461
02:17:25,879 --> 02:17:28,920
risking from the large time frame then

2462
02:17:28,920 --> 02:17:31,679
you're also risking a lot more and what

2463
02:17:31,679 --> 02:17:34,280
I mean by that is that if you look here

2464
02:17:34,280 --> 02:17:35,879
let me show you guys

2465
02:17:35,879 --> 02:17:37,920
this and I'm doing this because I know

2466
02:17:37,920 --> 02:17:39,080
other people are going to come back and

2467
02:17:39,080 --> 02:17:42,000
watch this if you get into a buy right

2468
02:17:42,000 --> 02:17:45,200
here an an hourly buy look at where your

2469
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:48,718
stop loss is look at where your risk

2470
02:17:48,718 --> 02:17:50,638
is you're

2471
02:17:50,638 --> 02:17:54,478
risking all of

2472
02:17:54,638 --> 02:17:59,000
this just to be just to hope that you

2473
02:17:59,000 --> 02:18:02,599
make this up above up here just to hope

2474
02:18:02,599 --> 02:18:05,398
that it it it comes all the way up here

2475
02:18:05,398 --> 02:18:07,478
to run the high you're risking all of

2476
02:18:07,478 --> 02:18:09,760
this but what if I told you you'd be

2477
02:18:09,760 --> 02:18:13,280
able to risk this

2478
02:18:14,040 --> 02:18:17,040
much youall see that little slivery red

2479
02:18:17,040 --> 02:18:18,040
this much

2480
02:18:18,040 --> 02:18:21,760
much in order to get the same

2481
02:18:21,760 --> 02:18:24,040
amount that's where multi-timeframe

2482
02:18:24,040 --> 02:18:28,398
analysis comes in and that's where

2483
02:18:28,398 --> 02:18:30,240
identifying those areas within

2484
02:18:30,240 --> 02:18:31,679
multi-time frame

2485
02:18:31,679 --> 02:18:35,398
analysis that's going to to to get you

2486
02:18:35,398 --> 02:18:38,359
that that that small stop loss that

2487
02:18:38,359 --> 02:18:39,398
small

2488
02:18:39,398 --> 02:18:41,679
risk I tell people all the time I want

02:18:41,679 --> 02:18:43,840

02:20:03,840 --> 02:20:05,359
younger son I want you to go to school

2518
02:20:05,359 --> 02:20:06,800
and get an education so you don't have

2519
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:09,399
to work as hard as I do and little did

2520
02:20:09,399 --> 02:20:10,080
he

2521
02:20:10,080 --> 02:20:12,760
know he meant get an education but it

2522
02:20:12,760 --> 02:20:14,439
wasn't in school for

2523
02:20:14,439 --> 02:20:16,920
me and and I have a college degree it

2524
02:20:16,920 --> 02:20:19,120

02:20:19,120 --> 02:20:23,080
me get education

2526
02:20:23,080 --> 02:20:26,319
yes but it's subjective to where that is

2527
02:20:26,319 --> 02:20:28,240
and the education for you to prosper in

2528
02:20:28,240 --> 02:20:31,760
the markets is

have join a Discord if you guys have not

2535
02:20:53,359 --> 02:20:55,920
done so already it's here the the link

2536
02:20:55,920 --> 02:20:58,240

2538
02:21:01,359 --> 02:21:04,359
Discord be a part of what we do there's

2539
02:21:04,359 --> 02:21:05,760
people who come in and get offended

2540
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:07,800
because I'm so like militant when it

2541
02:21:07,800 --> 02:21:09,880
comes to learning but this is direct you

2542
02:21:09,880 --> 02:21:11,280
don't have you don't have the

2543
02:21:11,280 --> 02:21:13,240
opportunity to mess up this is the one

2544
02:21:13,240 --> 02:21:15,880
minute time frame that I trade from and

2545
02:21:15,880 --> 02:21:18,800
we when we be find an hour moves right

2546
02:21:18,800 --> 02:21:20,280
4our

2547
02:21:20,280 --> 02:21:24,120
moves on the one

2548
02:21:25,960 --> 02:21:29,000
minute and so militant because that

2549
02:21:29,000 --> 02:21:31,600
discipline helped me to be as precise as

2550
02:21:31,600 --> 02:21:33,640
I am today and I'm precise every day

2551
02:21:33,640 --> 02:21:36,319
that I come in the market I dare you or

2552
02:21:36,319 --> 02:21:38,560
anybody that's new and that's listening

2553
02:21:38,560 --> 02:21:40,840
to the sound of my voice come on live

2554
02:21:40,840 --> 02:21:42,960
stream I dare

2555
02:21:42,960 --> 02:21:46,840
you and try to edit and alter whatever

2556
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:48,680
analysis is I'm given I'm promised you

2557
02:21:48,680 --> 02:21:51,640
you will get chopped up why because my

2558
02:21:51,640 --> 02:21:55,280
analysis is always

2559
02:21:55,280 --> 02:21:58,720
correct when I'm

2560
02:21:58,760 --> 02:22:02,520
live all you guys hear me you heard that

2561
02:22:02,520 --> 02:22:05,359
that sounds pompous and arrogant right

2562
02:22:05,359 --> 02:22:07,960
that sounds like not smart Raja Concepts

2563
02:22:07,960 --> 02:22:10,359
right to say something like that

2564
02:22:10,359 --> 02:22:14,040
right that's what that sounds like but

2565
02:22:14,040 --> 02:22:17,359
nope I said that and I mean it if I

2566
02:22:17,359 --> 02:22:20,040
telling you there's a cow in your

2567
02:22:20,040 --> 02:22:22,080
backyard and you go back there and the

2568
02:22:22,080 --> 02:22:24,399
cow is not

2569
02:22:24,399 --> 02:22:27,000
there you better call the police because

2570
02:22:27,000 --> 02:22:30,120
somebody stole your

2571
02:22:30,920 --> 02:22:35,800
cow someone stole your cow and if you

2572
02:22:35,800 --> 02:22:38,439
live in an

2573
02:22:39,080 --> 02:22:41,600
apartment someone stole the cow out of

2574
02:22:41,600 --> 02:22:44,240
your backyard I promise you you better

2575
02:22:44,240 --> 02:22:46,160
call the

2576
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:49,160
police

2577
02:22:49,479 --> 02:22:51,040
all right guys so I hope that that was

2578
02:22:51,040 --> 02:22:53,600
helpful um get out of here thanks

2579
02:22:53,600 --> 02:22:55,720
everybody for coming out um I hope you

2580
02:22:55,720 --> 02:22:57,280
guys learned as much as you know you

2581
02:22:57,280 --> 02:22:58,960
were able to I know this is Long window

2582
02:22:58,960 --> 02:23:01,120
was a very long teaching longer than I

2583
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:04,359
expected but this is the beginning of it

2584
02:23:04,359 --> 02:23:07,000
and this paired with what we're coming

2585
02:23:07,000 --> 02:23:10,520
back for tomorrow will help you get that

2586
02:23:10,520 --> 02:23:12,840
that right footing in in the market

2587
02:23:12,840 --> 02:23:13,920
you're going to have days where you

2588
02:23:13,920 --> 02:23:15,359
still have down days you still have up

2589
02:23:15,359 --> 02:23:17,880
days because the market moves opposite

2590
02:23:17,880 --> 02:23:21,680
of our um impulse so if our impulse is

2591
02:23:21,680 --> 02:23:23,960
to buy often times the market is selling

2592
02:23:23,960 --> 02:23:26,960
at that time when our impulse is to buy

2593
02:23:26,960 --> 02:23:29,120
when our impulse is to sell often times

2594
02:23:29,120 --> 02:23:32,319
Market is the market is buying at that

2595
02:23:32,319 --> 02:23:36,120
time Market moves opposite of our

2596
02:23:36,120 --> 02:23:38,880
impulse opposite of our impulse opposite

2597
02:23:38,880 --> 02:23:40,319
of our impulse that's what I said right

2598
02:23:40,319 --> 02:23:42,080
opposite of our

2599
02:23:42,080 --> 02:23:45,200
impulse opposite of our impulse and and

2600
02:23:45,200 --> 02:23:46,880
and with this let let me actually just

2601
02:23:46,880 --> 02:23:49,080
um note this out these

2602
02:23:49,080 --> 02:23:52,960
pullbacks happen at

2603
02:23:52,960 --> 02:23:56,040
previous previous highs that were former

2604
02:23:56,040 --> 02:23:58,399
pullbacks so the pullbacks happen within

2605
02:23:58,399 --> 02:23:59,200
the

2606
02:23:59,200 --> 02:24:01,600
pullbacks pullbacks happen within the

2607
02:24:01,600 --> 02:24:03,840
former pullbacks the previous P the the

2608
02:24:03,840 --> 02:24:05,399
current pullbacks will happen in a

2609
02:24:05,399 --> 02:24:07,479
former pullback the current pullback

2610
02:24:07,479 --> 02:24:09,479
will happen in a former pullback but the

2611
02:24:09,479 --> 02:24:11,600
current pullback happens at the former

2612
02:24:11,600 --> 02:24:14,520
pullbacks previous

2613
02:24:14,520 --> 02:24:17,359
Trend so the bullish pull the the

2614
02:24:17,359 --> 02:24:19,640
pullback that's that's on a bullish

2615
02:24:19,640 --> 02:24:22,960
Trend will happen at the

2616
02:24:22,960 --> 02:24:28,880
area that it pulled back on a bearish

2617
02:24:28,880 --> 02:24:30,800
