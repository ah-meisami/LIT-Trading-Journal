1
00:00:00,659 --> 00:00:02,480
foreign

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,240
if you have a mentor that has a system

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:08,460
you need to be able to see how to

4
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:12,960
operate that system every single day in

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:15,540
the market that's why I post 24 7. I

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,699
post in Asia because I get a post in

7
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,539
London Post in New York uh

8
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:23,760
my trigger finger my Twitter fingers I'm

9
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,859
always posting

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,720
um I actually wanted to explain this

11
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:29,699
Lowdown here too

12
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,900
did we take out this time

13
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:37,200
so I actually wanted to explain this I

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:39,719
told procharge that I would explain this

15
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:41,520
look at these highs and lows going down

16
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:43,940
for yesterday

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,120
you guys see this we have this low

18
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,100
and we have this high

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:56,039
and we come down and we violate it right

20
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,539
body close below it right

21
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,880
so now

22
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:09,380
let's make our way down

23
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:13,320
you have this low right here

24
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:15,900
you put in this high right here

25
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:18,840
you put in this low right here

26
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:20,820
you put in this high right here

27
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:24,180
we trade all the way down into this area

28
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:25,500
right

29
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:27,420
put it in this low right here

30
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:30,659
be putting this eye right here

31
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:33,420
we put in this low right here

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:35,820
we put in this high right here right

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,619
here you see that I got the little red

34
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,420
markers to it if you guys not following

35
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,040
along

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:42,780
you see

37
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:45,840
when we trade below this

38
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:49,259
we have this high

39
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:52,560
that takes us below this low but we know

40
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:56,579
that the validated high is right here so

41
00:01:56,579 --> 00:01:58,560
we're not looking for anything bullish

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:01,380
remarkable structure class until we come

43
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,960
up above here and I'm saying free market

44
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,340
structure class because that's what I

45
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,740
taught in the free market system class

46
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:12,140
so we have this high right here right

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,520
keep going where's the validated High

48
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,500
here

49
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:19,560
we have this load that we put in here

50
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,340
we have this high that we put in here

51
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,040
now here's where you have to okay

52
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,480
pay attention

53
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,660
so look we took out this low right

54
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:53,400
running this low is a structural low

55
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,060
this is a low that does not belong to

56
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,920
this time frame

57
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:04,400
so we have

58
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:09,540
this low here

59
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:12,300
we have this High here

60
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:15,000
that's from another time frame that's

61
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,640
not from this time frame

62
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,420
just because how large the range is how

63
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:25,500
large the swing is from this low to that

64
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,019
high above and then we violate it down

65
00:03:28,019 --> 00:03:30,800
over here right

66
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:34,560
so

67
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:39,480
if you look at the sizes of these highs

68
00:03:39,480 --> 00:03:43,819
and lows being created that's a 34 point

69
00:03:44,180 --> 00:03:47,700
low to that high region up there right

70
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:50,099
this is a 34 point

71
00:03:50,099 --> 00:03:53,280
low sorry 34 22 Point low to that high

72
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,560
up there

73
00:03:55,560 --> 00:03:58,739
when we take out this structural load to

74
00:03:58,739 --> 00:04:00,840
the left

75
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,980
order flow changes

76
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:07,519
because

77
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,099
we're following one minute order flow

78
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,000
to deliver us to a higher time frame low

79
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,238
when we take that higher time frame low

80
00:04:18,238 --> 00:04:20,699
we're no longer following that one

81
00:04:20,699 --> 00:04:22,500
minute order flow

82
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:25,380
because the low was violated

83
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:28,100
so

84
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,120
this slow here

85
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:45,500
and this High here

86
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,520
would be like a wick tapping back into

87
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,320
this swing

88
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:55,759
like we tend to do

89
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:05,220
let me see if I can find one

90
00:05:05,220 --> 00:05:08,060
like this

91
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,120
let me show you how it looks on the

92
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,800
higher time frame just from a one minute

93
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:16,280
swing

94
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:19,320
so let's say this is the larger swing

95
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:21,960
that I'm talking about right here

96
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,400
and we take out that low

97
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:27,660
this is a

98
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:30,240
a wick

99
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:33,440
we trade back into it

100
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,660
then you have this candle

101
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:39,539
trade down again that's what's

102
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:41,220
equivalent to what happened on a higher

103
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,699
time frame

104
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,520
y'all don't believe me

105
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:07,740
here's the low

106
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:10,460
right

107
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:13,280
[Music]

108
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,440
let me let me I I know I'm teaching let

109
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,100
me stop so look here's the low we train

110
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:22,319
below it

111
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:25,620
a wick let's say Wick right oh Wick we

112
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:27,900
got a wig right a wick

113
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:30,300
comes and tops back into it

114
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:33,360
And Trades us down

115
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,919
the order flow We are following is no

116
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,360
longer

117
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,979
this

118
00:06:40,979 --> 00:06:44,819
because this delivered us to the low we

119
00:06:44,819 --> 00:06:46,860
were looking for already

120
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:50,160
so now we need to see what our higher

121
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,740
time frame is saying

122
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,520
because we just ran a higher time frame

123
00:06:56,520 --> 00:06:58,940
low

124
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:05,100
so if we go into the four hour we see

125
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,580
that this is also a four hour low right

126
00:07:08,580 --> 00:07:12,360
and if we go up to the deli

127
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,199
good

128
00:07:20,599 --> 00:07:24,560
in the mentorship I teach about

129
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:28,380
these higher time frame targets these

130
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:31,740
daily highs daily lows the daily targets

131
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:37,199
what a day is set to achieve and how we

132
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,860
often see a reversal after that and

133
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:42,300
that's whether it's on the top side but

134
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,400
there's some Bob the bottom side it's

135
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,840
what the date is set out to achieve

136
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:51,479
we got that here in London

137
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:53,520
right here right

138
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,819
or or Asia or or whatever whatever I

139
00:07:56,819 --> 00:07:59,220
don't remember

140
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,840
but

141
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:05,099
we see that we took out a daily load

142
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:07,639
right

143
00:08:08,220 --> 00:08:10,880
let me go back

144
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,259
and upon taking out that daily low what

145
00:08:19,259 --> 00:08:21,500
happens

146
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:27,060
that high that low that high there

147
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:30,720
we begin to accumulate or arrange or

148
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,599
whatever it is that you guys look to

149
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:35,940
calling

150
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:39,320
We Begin the range

151
00:08:40,679 --> 00:08:43,440
oh

152
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,760
all right all right all right I said I'm

153
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:47,060
going to stop

154
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:51,480
so somebody somebody rushed and took

155
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:55,160
their remote and him you really fast

156
00:08:55,620 --> 00:08:57,660
so look we

157
00:08:57,660 --> 00:09:01,380
you see that we we have this high

158
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:04,740
we have this low we have this high

159
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:08,160
we have this low we trade

160
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,959
up above

161
00:09:09,959 --> 00:09:12,240
first of all first of all let me let me

162
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:15,120
just let me just open this up

163
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,720
I'll show you what's happening in here

164
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,720
this high this low sorry you guys I

165
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:23,220
really didn't got dyslexia I'm always

166
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:24,839
calling these lows highs I don't know

167
00:09:24,839 --> 00:09:29,940
this low this hot we got this low here

168
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:32,880
we got this High here remember

169
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:35,100
we took out a Strokes real low this

170
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,660
belongs to a different kind of order

171
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,399
flow here now

172
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:41,399
we're not utilizing the same thing up

173
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:42,540
here

174
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:45,420
so look at what happens

175
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,459
foreign

176
00:09:46,459 --> 00:09:49,620
this low right

177
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:52,380
we put in a series of highs up above

178
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,180
here

179
00:09:53,180 --> 00:09:56,899
what happened here

180
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:01,100
it's so hard to not

181
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:05,640
nope nope don't use dxy at all nope

182
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:07,980
I know other mentors preach about it and

183
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:10,200
say to use it don't use it at all trip

184
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,420
is on your truck don't use dick try for

185
00:10:12,420 --> 00:10:14,899
nothing at all nothing

186
00:10:14,899 --> 00:10:18,560
even if it looks

187
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:25,640
all right even if it looks like is this

188
00:10:25,740 --> 00:10:28,440
is moving

189
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:30,899
with indices or is moving against

190
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:33,660
indices or whatever it is you're not

191
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,700
using that you trading what's on your

192
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:37,740
chart not what's on another chart

193
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,399
because that dxy is a basket of

194
00:10:41,399 --> 00:10:43,820
currencies that are in it right

195
00:10:43,820 --> 00:10:46,800
basket of currencies that are in it the

196
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,160
Euros in it the pound is in it the yen

197
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,760
is in it the cat is in it all of these

198
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,060
different currencies are are within that

199
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:00,000
so to use that to correlate absolutely

200
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,980
not don't do it but

201
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:04,019
let's get back to this the Euro has the

202
00:11:04,019 --> 00:11:05,459
highest percentage that's sending it but

203
00:11:05,459 --> 00:11:08,220
let's get back to it so

204
00:11:08,220 --> 00:11:11,180
look at what happens

205
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,940
we fail to put in another low

206
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:19,760
and you see us quickly run up sorry

207
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,640
you see us quickly run up and take out

208
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:26,100
this high

209
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:29,120
right here right

210
00:11:31,079 --> 00:11:32,279
so

211
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,399
we now have

212
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,240
a swing of bullish flip that's what we

213
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,980
call it right as we call it right

214
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:46,860
[Music]

215
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,860
now this is London it was looking really

216
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,940
ugly today

217
00:11:50,940 --> 00:11:53,220
could you trade this yes do you need

218
00:11:53,220 --> 00:11:56,220
experience to trade this yes

219
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:58,860
but one thing we have going on within

220
00:11:58,860 --> 00:12:01,100
this

221
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:04,540
[Music]

222
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,860
yeah I know I teach a lot about

223
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,970
mitigating an area multiple times

224
00:12:10,970 --> 00:12:13,380
[Music]

225
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:16,620
I teach a lot about that

226
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,079
you see that we're just mitigating this

227
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:23,339
area multiple times then we fail below

228
00:12:23,339 --> 00:12:24,959
it

229
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,279
and what happens after

230
00:12:29,399 --> 00:12:32,839
we trade up above it

231
00:12:32,940 --> 00:12:36,060
where is our swing

232
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:39,420
and what is this reaching into within

233
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:42,140
our swing

234
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:50,399
[Music]

235
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:59,100
you see we tap right into the 30 percent

236
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:03,240
your confirmation is this High taken out

237
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:04,980
always talk to you about the previous

238
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:06,839
hobby being flipped if you didn't want

239
00:13:06,839 --> 00:13:08,279
to use that because you said that

240
00:13:08,279 --> 00:13:10,860
Candlestick high is risky

241
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:14,660
here's the high that brought the low

242
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,320
you got another swing a dip inside of

243
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:21,779
there and we trade up above it

244
00:13:21,779 --> 00:13:24,540
we come back to tap into the imbalance

245
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:27,060
responsible for the shift

246
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:29,100
and then we trade out of it that's

247
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:32,639
London what happens next

248
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,120
we break down what is the early sign of

249
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:39,180
us breaking down when we violate the s d

250
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:41,100
responsible for the break of structure

251
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:43,980
this is all of the videos in my course

252
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:48,720
that I'm running through on exactly this

253
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:50,700
so when we violate the s d responsible

254
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,240
for the break

255
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,420
what do we usually do

256
00:13:56,459 --> 00:14:00,959
we go back to the origin

257
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:07,639
we go back to the origin of the move

258
00:14:08,220 --> 00:14:11,579
the origin of the move is here

259
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:13,800
what do you see us do

260
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:17,100
we fail to put in a new loan because

261
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,500
guess what

262
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:22,620
though this is a four hour low or a

263
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:25,100
daily low

264
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,300

00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:36,480
we have a 15 let me actually put

267
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:39,139
different colors

00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:46,880
we have a 15 minute

270
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:51,060
High here we have a 15 minute low here

271
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:55,579
we have a 15 minute High here

272
00:14:56,699 --> 00:14:59,160
we violate

273
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,079
the 15 minute

274
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:04,920
low protected love

275
00:15:04,920 --> 00:15:07,980
while we're understanding that

276
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:11,339
anything within here

277
00:15:11,339 --> 00:15:14,279
comes from a higher time frame so we're

278
00:15:14,279 --> 00:15:15,780
not drawing out

279
00:15:15,780 --> 00:15:18,919
[Music]

280
00:15:19,019 --> 00:15:24,120
the order block from the top of the hill

281
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:26,760
to see a price come in and short it down

282
00:15:26,760 --> 00:15:29,279
back to the lows because we understand

283
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:35,220
that we're within different time frames

284
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:37,980
we are working within multiple time

285
00:15:37,980 --> 00:15:40,440
frames the four hour of the daily to the

286
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:43,199
left one minute bringing us down the New

287
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,000
Order flow that begins after we check

288
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,680
out the higher time frame High the

289
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:49,440
higher time frame low sorry

290
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,500

291
00:15:52,500 --> 00:15:53,639
minute

292
00:15:53,639 --> 00:15:56,160
that are trading into London's

293
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:59,880
accumulation the 15-minute highs and

294
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:04,160

that's a lot right there's a lot right

00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:13,450

[Music]

301
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,519
we trade back below it

302
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:32,220
and we fail you see I wrote fail here

303
00:16:32,220 --> 00:16:34,620
that was this morning that was before we

304
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,720
even had this whole push up and we'll

305
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:38,220
fail

306
00:16:38,220 --> 00:16:41,000
f

307
00:16:41,639 --> 00:16:44,420
bail

308
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:49,279
so when we fail

309
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:54,259
now upon the failure of taking the low

310
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:57,779
one minute bullish order flow begins

311
00:16:57,779 --> 00:16:58,920
again

312
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,920
one

313
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:11,400
one minute bullish order flow begins

314
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,520
again

315
00:17:15,839 --> 00:17:19,579
so we put in this low here

316
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:23,880
what's the high that sent it down there

317
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,959
not that one

318
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:30,540
a 15 minute high is responsible for

319
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:33,380
sending it down there

320
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,500
actually

321
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:38,400
correction

322
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,980
a one minute high is responsible for

323
00:17:40,980 --> 00:17:43,620
sending it down nip

324
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,240
I say that because if you look below

325
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:47,720
this Wick

326
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,179
biswick low this high

327
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:53,640
to get a closure below it we got it

328
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,960
right here

329
00:17:54,960 --> 00:17:57,059
so from this low

330
00:17:57,059 --> 00:17:59,940
we traded up above and we came back down

331
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:02,460
this Wick Wicked down but we got a body

332
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:04,380
closure below right there

333
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,660
y'all see that

334
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:09,120
right there's the body closure that

335
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:10,860
validates this high

336
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,660
so we're not looking for anything

337
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,919
bullish

338
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,299
until we break this high with what a

339
00:18:18,299 --> 00:18:21,020
body closure

340
00:18:21,299 --> 00:18:23,960
so

341
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:30,380
we know again

342
00:18:31,559 --> 00:18:36,000
where our one minute swing is right

343
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,559
and this is probably the five minute but

344
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:40,760
I'm gonna leave it as in one minute

345
00:18:41,220 --> 00:18:45,620
you trade back into the 50 of the move

346
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:48,900
we trade back into the s d responsible

347
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,940
for the break

348
00:18:50,940 --> 00:18:53,220
here

349
00:18:53,220 --> 00:18:55,020
and actually

350
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:57,059
no no I'm not gonna go that's a little

351
00:18:57,059 --> 00:19:00,200
too technical for you guys

352
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:05,880
you see we come all the way down into it

353
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:10,400
almost take out the low but we leave it

354
00:19:10,500 --> 00:19:14,039
and then we trade higher out of there

355
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:16,020
we come back into it again guess what

356
00:19:16,020 --> 00:19:17,760
first up break structure second tap

357
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:20,220
double bottom right

358
00:19:20,220 --> 00:19:22,020
we get that

359
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:24,240
and we trade out

360
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:28,100
so when we take the next High

361
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,780
we trade up above it

362
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:51,200
here

363
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:53,760
now

364
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,320
with this happening here

365
00:19:57,360 --> 00:20:02,179
these these Wicks flailing up above it

366
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:06,179
and then you see this closure right here

367
00:20:06,179 --> 00:20:08,280
this is the closure

368
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:10,380
that I would consider

369
00:20:10,380 --> 00:20:13,980
taking out this High why because this

370
00:20:13,980 --> 00:20:17,400
High doesn't belong to the one minute

371
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:21,320
well look at when the closure happened

372
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:31,080
so we trade down below we have multiple

373
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,820
highs and lows within here multiple

374
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:34,740
highs and lows within here

375
00:20:34,740 --> 00:20:38,720
and what do we have restarted again

376
00:20:58,580 --> 00:21:01,380
where do we trade from

377
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:05,299
tapping back into the zone

378
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,059
we trade up above

379
00:21:12,059 --> 00:21:15,140
we tap back into the 30 percent here

380
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,760
we trade out of it

381
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:19,860
we trade out of it again

382
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:22,020
we trade out of it again

383
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:25,440
we trade out of it again what did I say

384
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,660
about when a demand is created

385
00:21:31,280 --> 00:21:33,480
what did I say

386
00:21:33,480 --> 00:21:37,700
about when a demand is created

387
00:21:38,159 --> 00:21:41,220
Ray I know you here girl what's up what

388
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,260
did I say about this

389
00:21:43,260 --> 00:21:45,900
I said anytime we have a equal high

390
00:21:45,900 --> 00:21:47,760
above a demand or even you see some

391
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:50,960
consolidating happening above the demand

392
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:56,760
it gives reason to dig back inside of it

393
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,700
so we dig back inside of it

394
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,500
and then you see your straight out again

395
00:22:04,140 --> 00:22:07,159
now if you look

396
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:11,900
within here

397
00:22:14,100 --> 00:22:18,440
this is another low on the 15 minute

398
00:22:18,539 --> 00:22:23,059
this is a high on the 15 minute

399
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:27,600
and This Is Us trading below it

400
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,140
so if we're following structure if we're

401
00:22:31,140 --> 00:22:33,780
following the order flow

402
00:22:33,780 --> 00:22:36,360
we're following the order flow

403
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:38,340
we're then we're using one minute order

404
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:40,500
flow we're using 15 minute order flow

405
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:43,620
but what's governing us

406
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:46,679
the higher time frame we just came below

407
00:22:46,679 --> 00:22:49,620
a higher time frame low

408
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:52,440
so the one minute is a different Beast

409
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,120
because

410
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:56,580
the one minute it delivers

411
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:00,059
all it delivers the order flow all time

412
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:03,480
frames above it but it delivers it in a

413
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:05,760
specific manner

414
00:23:05,760 --> 00:23:08,400
specific manner

415
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:10,140
so not only that

416
00:23:10,140 --> 00:23:12,179
[Music]

417
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,640
I told you guys about us mitigating an

418
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:17,640
area multiple times right

419
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:20,840
what do we have here

420
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:25,500
bounce

421
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,960
bounce

422
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:29,160
bounce right

423
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,659
[Music]

424
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:31,880
and we trade up

425
00:23:31,880 --> 00:23:33,120
[Music]

426
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:35,700
that happened what was it two days ago

427
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:38,760
on stream the same exact thing these

428
00:23:38,760 --> 00:23:41,039
areas that we mitigate multiple times it

429
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,940
often looks like support term resistance

430
00:23:44,940 --> 00:23:47,640
resistance to support all of those you

431
00:23:47,640 --> 00:23:48,659
know

432
00:23:48,659 --> 00:23:51,240
Concepts that the people who follow that

433
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,340
really don't work out

434
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,900
um

435
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:56,820
so

436
00:23:56,820 --> 00:23:59,340
this here if you can't understand when

437
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:02,039
this happens stay out of it wait for

438
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:04,500
something clearer

439
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:08,840
what do we have that's clearer over here

440
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,000
we have this one minute low

441
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:20,280
and we trade up and fail to put in a new

442
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,419
high

443
00:24:21,419 --> 00:24:25,500
we trade below this low we tap back into

444
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:28,559
the area and you see her short

445
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,539
and the whole time we stay short

446
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:35,940
we trade it up

447
00:24:35,940 --> 00:24:40,080
back down into here we stay short right

448
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:42,360
what do we notice

449
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:43,679
about

450
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,860
our 15 minute

451
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:49,940
low again

452
00:24:50,400 --> 00:24:53,299
from London

453
00:24:54,900 --> 00:24:57,559
here

454
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:00,659
we failed here

455
00:25:00,659 --> 00:25:03,000
we put in this low trade it up to put in

456
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:04,740
a new high right here

457
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:08,059
we failed here and then we failed here

458
00:25:08,059 --> 00:25:10,860
three failures

459
00:25:10,860 --> 00:25:13,080
prices does not want to go down with

460
00:25:13,080 --> 00:25:14,039
this

461
00:25:14,039 --> 00:25:18,740
so because we failed to close below

462
00:25:19,020 --> 00:25:22,440
you see This ferocious move up

463
00:25:22,440 --> 00:25:25,700
at 9 30.

464
00:25:27,779 --> 00:25:31,279
and we begin to take out

465
00:25:32,460 --> 00:25:34,200
foreign

466
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:38,240
all of these highs to the left

467
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:43,279
we trade up above all of that

468
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:48,500
so

469
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:52,980
what we need to understand with this

470
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:54,480
is that

471
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,240
these highs and lows belong to different

472
00:25:57,240 --> 00:26:01,320
time frames and once a higher time frame

473
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:03,659
low or a higher time frame high is

474
00:26:03,659 --> 00:26:08,039
violated a different order flow begins

475
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,200
it's not the same one that brought it

476
00:26:10,200 --> 00:26:13,559
down there it achieved its its low it

477
00:26:13,559 --> 00:26:15,779
achieved this delivery

478
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:19,860
now we have to watch and see what comes

479
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:23,039
of it next and what session we're into

480
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:24,659
because you're not going to get this

481
00:26:24,659 --> 00:26:26,700
type of volume in Asia there's been a

482
00:26:26,700 --> 00:26:28,799
few Asian sessions where we had tons of

483
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:30,659
volume in it but for this one in

484
00:26:30,659 --> 00:26:32,940
particular this is London here you're

485
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,799
not going to get this type of volume in

486
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:37,380
Asia so if Asia does take out a higher

487
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,760
time frame low

488
00:26:38,760 --> 00:26:41,100
you want to wait to see what London is

489
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,279
doing
