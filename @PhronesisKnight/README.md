**Mitigate a level of Demand\Supply** => Continuation of a Trend
**Violate a Protected High\Low** => Directional Change = Start a new trend

**Structural Structure**
**Structural Range**

- Working with LTF retracement inside of HTF Structural Range
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[2022.10.03] [26] [Rules-Of-Engagement] 

LIQ = Liquidity = Money = Orders = Fuel
Different Form Of LIQ: 
    Structural LIQ:         (presented through structure like: old-highs\old-lows | higher-high\higher-low | FVG)
        - internal LIQ
        - external LIQ
        - BSL
        - SSL
        - IRLIQ = internal-range LIQ
        - ERLIQ = external-range LIQ
    
    Session LIQ:            (like: session-high\session-low )
        - Asia (18-01)
        - London 02-06
        - NewYork 07-10

1. You Must Trade LIQ
2. You Must Understand Logic
3. LIQ without Logic is useless
4. SMC is useless without Logic
5. SM is the ability to think like Market-Makers (that moves the price = ALGO)

Engineering-Liquidity to Induce You before it come back to liquidate-You [https://www.instagram.com/p/CjbddN_N2Zy/]

**LIQG = Liquidity Grab = Smart Money Footprint = SMF
1. SM had reasons to come back to the area where huge buy\sell happened 
2. At least to mitigate the last point where huge buy\sell started [buy-to-sell]

**Flip Zone**:
1. base on pervious movement
2. after SSL is taken in consolidation area
3. expecting a bullish OTE for HTF = expecting market-structure-shift in LTF
2. but bullish OTE failed and huge sell happened 
3. supply is winner in the battle between supply and demand
4. this bullish OTE area which fight happened is the Flip Zone

**Supply and Demand Areas**
1. They are not Areas of Sells or Buys 
1. They are Areas of Negotiation of Big-Boys

Total movement of price is to: 
1. (grab iLIQ and delivers to eLIQ) <=> (grab eLIQ and deliver to iLIQ) 
2. (grab BSL and delivers to SSL) <=> (grab SSL and deliver to BSL)
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[2022.12.29] [01] [intro-to-SMC] 
**Concept: Supply\Demand**

1. Supply Zone == Big Sellers waiting to SELL = Level of Big Sellers
2. Demand Zone == Big Buyers waiting to BUY   = Level of Big Buyers

Big Buyers/Sellers = institutions / banks

**Concept: Inducement**
Purpose of Inducement => Creating Liquidity 
Purpose of Inducement => Engagement
Purpose of Inducement => Giving reasons to retail traders to enter the market
Idea behind Inducement => Convince You to take a setup
Idea behind Inducement => Convince Traders to engage price by creating chart patterns that fits Bus \ Sell Setup in terms of TA

Retail Chart Patterns:  
- Double Top
- Double Bottom
- Triple Top
- Triple Bottom
- Head and Shoulder
- Trendline
- Price Action Patterns

Where we have Big Buyers \ Sellers ?
Big Buyers \ Sellers => Counter Trend Traders
\\The ALGO have been programmed to follow the behavior of Big Guys.
if every body in the world is seeing a setup then the setup is an Inducement.

\\Inducement => invites you enter the market
\\Liquidity => takes you out of the market

\\Liquidity Fuels the momentum of price in certain zones

Multiple Inducement:
1. Send Buyers\Sellers out of the market
2. Create Fuel for Big Guys who are sitting in Supply\Demand zones


- Initial Intention is to Buy
- Second Intention is to induce sellers to enter the market for more liquidity
- purpose of inducement <<market needs liquidity>>
- inducement invites you to engage the market
- liquidity takes you out of the market

**Once a Supply level failed to HOLD it transfer power to a new level of Demand**
**Once a Demand level failed to HOLD it transfer power to a new level of Supply**
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[2022.12.29] [02] [intro-to-SMC] 
Consolidating = Range = No Clear trend = Moving from a supply to demand and vice versa.

**Concept: Inefficiency**
Inefficiency: distance between candle 1 and candle 3 are inefficient move
Logic Behind Inefficiency: Price must move to inside Inefficiency and fill it before continuing its trend.
Logic Behind Inefficiency: Inefficiency must be filled.
Logic Behind Inefficiency: Imbalances must be filled.

1. Price must delivered efficiently
2. Price forms inducements
3. Price takes-out inducements

Trendline liquidity => every time you see a trendline it is violated
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[2022.12.30] [03] [Market-Structure] 

**Concept: Market-Structure**

- ClearTrend    => [Starts-after-inducement-and-taking-liquidity]

- UpTrend       => [StrongLow---WeakHigh]
- DownTrend     => [StrongHigh---WeakLow]

- StrongHigh    => [ProtectedHigh] [Should-not-violated-to-the-upside]
- StrongLow     => [ProtectedLow] [Should-not-violated-to-the-downside]

\\HTF Rounds creates LTF Trends

[2022.12.30] [03] [Market-Structure] 

**Concept: Multi-Timeframe-Structural-Corelation**

Supply violated => transfer power to Demand
Demand violated => transfer power to Supply
------------------------------------------------

[05] [Market-Structure] 
internal-BoS

Structure inside another Structure
Sell to Buy => Retracement Leg

[16:12] [directional-change]
1. mitigate a level of demand
2. violate a protected high
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[06] [Market-Structure] [external-liquidity] [major-liquidity]
HTF Round is LTF trend

in uptrend   :: HH=> weakHigh , HL=> strongLow
in downtrend :: LL=> weakLow , LH=> strongHigh

in uptrend   :: HH=> ext-LIQ , HL=> maj-LIQ
in downtrend :: LL=> ext-LIQ , LH=> maj-LIQ

HTF LIQ:
    maj-LIQ == respected LIQ == expected to be respected
    ext-LIQ == violated LIQ == expected to be violated (takes out LIQ)
LTF LIQ
    int-LIQ == internal LIQ (FVG)
    ind-LIQ == inducement LIQ

**3 Type of market structure**:
1. Simple Structure    
2. Complex Structure   
3. Range Structure

1. Simple-Structure: 
    printing clear (HH,HL) (LL,LH)

2. Complex-Structure: 
    - combination of (Shallow Corrective Wave) + (Deep Correcting Wave)
    - shallow corrective wave = mitigate internal-Structure = pullback internal-Structure = fail to continue its HTF trend
    - deep correcting wave  = mitigate maj-LIQ

3. Range-Structure
    - price breaks out-of-the-range and the create a new structure 
    - it is called Range Structure because it is out of the range
    - most time when you see Range-Structure we are not expecting a deep pullback

internal-Structure = int-Structure = HTF Structure (for example: h4)
external-Structure = ext-Structure = LTF Structure (for example: m5)
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[07] [ext-LIQ] [int-LIQ]

**different types of ext-LIQ** BSL\SSL
- [less-concern-LIQ] Old Highs\Lows
- [common-LIQ] Equal Highs\Lows (EQH\EQL) [double-top] [double-bottom] [triple-top] [triple-bottom] 
- [common-LIQ] Trendline phantom [Buy-side-Trendline-phantom] [sell-side-Trendline-phantom] 

[stop-hunt]
phantom EQH: [buy-stop]   1. price grab BSL\EQH 2. price continues its direction to the downside
phantom EQL: [sell-stop]  1. price grab SSL\EQL 2. price continues its direction to the upside

**different types of int-LIQ**
- FVG = imbalance = inefficiency
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[08] [live-examples]
**Confluence** (after concepts we talk about confluence)
- putting all of the concepts together 
- create a story for price 
- able to analyze the market 
- take proper financial decision

- takes LIQ from the SS then deliver it to the BS 
- takes LIQ from the BS then deliver it to the SS 
- price continues to a POI
- price put to a momentum
- aggressively moves to the up\down side depending on the Order Flow

**price must not take a certain level of liquidity if it doesn't needs to**
- suppose order flow is bearish
- if we have LIQ to the upside
- most times we don't have supply zone to be mitigated above the LIQ
- then price continues in the bearish order flow

- price always mitigate int-LIQ before heading to the ext-LIQ or price will go to the area or less-concern-LIQ
- common-LIQ        : every one can see that LIQ
- less-concern-LIQ  : not every one can see that LIQ like Old high\low
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[09] [int-LIQ]
imbalance = IMB = the difference bw high of candle 1 and low of candle 3 = strong momentum cause IMB

What price dose?
- seek LIQ
- tap into LIQ
- get momentum from LIQ
- move 

**Inefficiency as Entry Point \ Inefficiency as Target**

**Price must not fill every Inefficiency, it solely depends on order flow**
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[10] [Supply-Demand-OB]

IFC = Institutional Funded Candle
SC = Sponsored Candle
OB = Order Block

Characteristic of Potential OB:
1. inline with order flow
2. took LIQ (after-that)
3. FVG      (after-that)

in bearish-trend: last-bullish-candle before the bearish run that took LIQ (took LIQ = BoS)
in bullish-trend: last-bearish-candle before the bullish run that took LIQ (took LIQ = BoS)

Characteristic of Supply-Level: 
1. in down trend movement, reside in old-highs (strong-highs)  
2. last bullish candle before the bearish-run
------------------------------------------------

3. [mitigation]     continues in you direction [mitigate-supply]
4. [continuation]

**smart money model one**
1. SP   => Stop Purge = Stop Hunt
2. mbos => minor break of structure = CHoCH = LTF BoS reacting from HTF zone
3. RTO  => Return To Order Block = Return to OTE
4. [continuation]

manipulation = simply means to create an inducement that make sellers\buyers feel to begin engage in price
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[12] [manipulation-neutralization] [smart-money-footprint]
HTF supply\ demand zone
HTF supply\ demand level
HTF supply\ demand candle

daily OB
daily BR
daily MB

**important note**
1. any 1.sp 2.mbos 3.rto is not a valid setup
2. we have to respecting a HTF valid zone

**CHoCH**: LTF BoS due to retesting\reacting of the HTF supply\demand
**CHoCH**: LTF BoS reacting to HTF zone

**important note** 
when mitigation happened then power transferred from one OB to another OB.

- the first move is misleading move
- the first move is inducement move
- the first move also contains trendline phantom LIQ which is minor-LIQ

**transfer of form**
transfer power from one mitigated block to another mitigated block
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[13] [flip-zone]
1. sp
2. bos
3. expecting mitigation 
4. expecting huge mitigation 
5. but it is a small mitigation
6. unexpectedly supply level is violated
7. when a supply level is violated => automatically power transfers from supply level to demand level that **sponsored the rally** [price-flips]
8. **sponsored the rally** means +OB
9. we have to be dynamic enough and follow the Order Flow

a failed supply has potentiality to transfers power to demand block that sponsored the rally that took out the supply
a failed demand has potentiality to transfers power to supply block that sponsored the rally that took out the demand
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[14] [Understanding-Logic-and-basic-of-engagement]
after every Mitigation I expect Manipulation
Mitigation invites smart money trader to enter the market
Mitigation is valid only it has BOS.

BOS is the smart money footprint.
Huge Move =>> Market Maker did not give you a chance to enter the party
**either see the liquidity or be the liquidity. If you fail to see the liquidity you will be become automatically the liquidity**
------------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------------
[15] [Understanding-Logic-and-basic-of-engagement]
1. where is price !?
2. where is price going to !?
3. why is price going there !? for example: taking liquidity

- 🟢 The only difference btw retail-trader and smart-money-trader: 1.Risk-Reward 2.Logic

1. moving-downside with momentum
2. moving-upside (correction) is choppy
3. moving-downside again with momentum
4. it means smart-money is not interested the buys
5. the momentum grab liquidity from SSL

[higher-high***higher-low] [lower-high***lower-low] is meaningful only when taking external-liquidity

1. what we are looking for !? 
2. is the area that price react from
3. these levels is just internal-liquidity
4. why should you be consider these lows as a low sponsored this move to the upside !?
5. IMPORTANT: a snipped block on HTF is a breaker-block-mitigation on the LTF 
6. IMPORTANT: a snipped OB on HTF is a breaker-block-mitigation on the LTF 

- every breaker-block-mitigation once mitigated => the moments price return back to that area => that breaker-block-mitigation automatically becomes liquidity.
- in LTF, price is not actually mitigated the OB, price only mitigated the BRKB
- it means that level automatically became a level of liquidity in the future

- 🟡 support broken becomes resistance ===>>> because they want to engineer liquidity 
- 🟡 so automatically we have liquidity resting above this area 
- 🟡 retail-logic which is fuel for price
- who works with me understand that business: until this low is not broken
- this low confirm that price is not willing to go lower
- you have to some kind of logic that gives you think out of **general-trend**

- after price finish faking these guys
- 🔴 **once a BRKB have been mitigated the supporting base of a BRKB can not be a valid OB** 
- **even if I marked this area as POI, I would not engage in an area of interest until it gives me my smart-money-footprint.**

smart-money-footprint: 
1. grab liquidity
2. break of structure
3. return to OTE

🔴 **Origin of Demand\Supply**
🔴 **Decisive of Demand\Supply**

🟡 Scenario 1
1. HTF Decisive of Supply vs. HTF Origin of Supply
2. LTF Flip Zone
3. LTF Liquidity Grab
4. LTF Order Block Formation
5. LTF BoS
6. LTF Return To Order Block
7. Expecting same confirmation on RTO

**Demand Failure Transfers Power to the Supply, that caused the Failure.** DFTPS
**ُSupply Failure Transfers Power to the Demand, that caused the Failure.** SFTPD

🟡 Scenario 2
My Expectation at this level:
 1. liquidity level, have been taking 
 2. demand level, hold the price
Why!? 
 1. already we have grab on liquidity
 2. BoS
Result:
 1. EQL is just an inducement leg that should be taking out
 2. So when the price reach to this level I enter the trade aggressively
 3. SL is below the demand level
 4. TP is last point of supply inside the BoS 
 
 **Return to Last Point of Supply inside the BoS** RT-LPS
 **Return to Last Point of Demand inside the BoS** RT-LPD

🟡 Scenario 3
1. nice liquidity grab
2. but failed to shift BoS
3. demand Order Flow still in play

🟡 Scenario 4
1. there is not a nice liquidity grab
2. return to last point of buy had been mitigated
3. demand order flow was taking out
4. failed demand order flow automatically transfers power to supply level that caused the failure

**Return to Last Point of Buy**         RT-LPB
**Return to Last Point Of Sell**        RT-LPS
**Return to Last Point Of Internal Liquidity**   RT-LPIL

**transfers power from demand to supply level that caused the failure**
**transfers power from supply to demand level that caused the failure**

🟡 Scenario 5
1. nice liquidity grab
2. expecting BoS but there is no BoS
3. ????

**failed demand order flow** FDOF 
**failed supply order flow** FSOF

**respected demand order flow** RDOF 
**respected supply order flow** RSOF 

**mitigated demand order flow** MDOF 
**mitigated supply order flow** MSOF 

when price begins to give us internal-bullish-intent, ite target is external-liquidity

**internal-bullish-intent** 
**internal-bearish-intent**

🟡 Scenario 6 [22:00]
1. nice grab-on-liquidity
2. tap into last-point-of-buy
3. cover the imbalance (FVG)
4. shift the structure
5. actual break of structure

🟡 Scenario 7 [25:00]
1. nice grab-on-liquidity
2. tap into last-point-of-demand
3. it shows that the demand order flow is intact
4. this wick grab-liquidity =>> means that it has money on it

**the supply that sponsored the failure becomes the flip-zone**

🟡 Scenario 8 [31:13]
1. nice SSL grab-on-liquidity
2. +BoS
3. expecting expansion from RTO
4. but failed to happen and create a flip-zone [failed-level-of-demand] [transfer-power-to-the-supply-caused-the-failure]
5. asap price broke the demand level, came back immediately to mitigate the supply before drop.
6. return to last-point-of-institutional-buys PLUS return to FVG
7. price has to back to this level to give a chance to composite men exit their positions at break-even

**composite men** [https://medium.com/@Blocksavant/composite-man-ca18c9d2d5a5] 
**Wyckoff rules**
1. the market never behave in the same way twice. 
2. context is everything in the financial markets.

🟡 Scenario 9 [32:00]
1. nice SSL grab-on-liquidity
2. +BoS
3. RTO

💚 Failed Supply\Demand form Flip-Zone
💚 When price come back to Flip-Zone it has to be mitigated despite of GoL & SiS

**Indecision Candle**

**when we have 2 setup: bullish-setup and bearish-setup, any of them that plays first, it comes stronger than the other.**

[20:40]
**if after BoS, price came back to the demand level first, then it is very possible to have seen a bullish move happen.**
**but because that failed to hold, the area that mitigated first has the upper hand.**
