Retail Traders Strategies:
1. Breakout Traders
2. Reversal Traders
3. Trendline Traders
4. Smart Money Traders
5. Pattern Traders
6. Tool Traders
7. Indicator Traders 

Retail Traders Strategies works in all TFs.  SO all TFs can be approached the same way.
====================================================================================

====================================================================================
EQLs = Strong Level Of Support
EQHs = Strong Level Of Resistance
SMT = Smart Money Trap
Potential
====================================================================================

====================================================================================
1st Stage Of Liquidity = Where Retail Traders ENTER !?
2nd Stage Of Liquidity = Where Retail Traders EXIT  !? (Stop Loss)
====================================================================================

4. Retail Trap
    Breakout Inducement   => BO Traders 
    Reversal Inducement
    Trendline Inducement  => TL Traders 
    SmartMoney Inducement => SM Traders

5. **ALGO concepts vs. INDUCEMENT concepts**
====================================================================================

====================================================================================
**POI = Point Of Interest (Continuation\Reversal Points) = Consolidation (DZ\SZ)**

SZ = Supply Zone
DZ = Demand Zone
SC = Supply Candle
DC = Demand Candle

MZ = Mitigation Zone            => 1.Filling The Imbalances 2.Tap into DC\SC (ICT-Order-Block)
IZ = Imbalance Zone
ID = Intended Direction         => Reaction from DZ\SZ **FORMS** Intention before Direction: I2C\I2R
I2C = Intention to Continuation 
I2R = Intention to Reversal

RVA = Revisit Again (Pullback)
ENGLQ = Engineering Liquidity

HPT = High Probability Trade
LPT = Low Probability Trade

IRL = Internal Range Liquidity 
ERL = External Range Liquidity
.................................

.................................
**S2D** = 1.Supply is Broken 2.Get Reaction 3. Create the Demand
**D2S** = 1.Demand is Broken 2.Get Reaction 3. Create the Supply
.................................
Imbalance (Inefficiency) Can be used with DZ\SZ to create potential MZ

.................................
Over Refined Zone = ORZ => Miss The Trade
**Refine DZ**: 1.DZ 2.DC 3.IZ 4.ID 5.RVA
**Refine SZ**: 1.SZ 2.SC 3.IZ 4.ID 5.RVA
.................................

.................................
**Market Structure**: 
1.Main-Structure 
2.Main-Push 
3.Internal-Structure-Play
4.Internal-BoS
5.Fake-BoS (Trap Buyers & Sellers) (ICT-Breaker-Block)
6.Main-BoS

*CHoCH = Potential BoS*

Multi-POI Which one works !?

TLQ = Transactional Liquidity
SLQ = Structural Liquidity
ILQ = Inducement Liquidity

Retail Traders Slogan: Losses Are Part Of The Game

The only time we look at BoS is after Inducing HTF Mitigation (ICT-Order-Block) !
.................................

.................................
**Order Flow: Consecutive Mitigation Zones In One Direction(1.Push 2.Pullback)**

**Continuation Order Flow**
1.Channels Creates Buyers & Sellers in the both side of the market
2.After Channels is INDUCEMENT to low => Clear SSL
3.After INDUCEMENT is Imbalance
4.Below the Imbalance is POI
5.Above Imbalance is Internal-BoS
6.Above Internal-BoS is Main-BoS

**Reversal Order Flow**
1.Channels are Failure Swings and creates LRLR
2.INDUCEMENT to high => Clear BSL
3.After INDUCEMENT is Imbalance
4.Above the Imbalance is POI
5.Below Imbalance is Internal-BoS
6.Below Internal-BoS is Main-BoS

**Between two Price-Swing-Leg which one acts as BoS !? Main-Push**  *(@YusufTrader1:Internal-Push)*

- Channel
- Inducement
- Internal-BoS
- Pullback-POI
- Main-BoS
.................................

.................................
**POI vs. Potential POI = POI has BoS, Potential POI has CHoCH**

Liquidity in the form of Channel & Trendline is Easy-Identified-Liquidity.

Other form of  Easy-Identified-Liquidity:
    Trend-Line Traders          **FORMS** TrendLine Liquidity           : TLTR => TLLQ
    Support-Resistance Traders  **FORMS** Support-Resistance Liquidity  : SRTR => SRLQ
    Smart-Money Traders         **FORMS** Smart-Money Liquidity         : SMTR => SMLQ
    Break-Out Traders           **FORMS** Break-Out Liquidity           : BOTR => BOLQ

Building Channel to the Upside + Inducement to the Upside **FORMS** BSL for

People needs **REASON** to take the trade. **PAIN** 

**Continuation-Inducement-Cycle**: Induce to Reversal with **SPEED** then Continues
    1. Build Channel Up
    2. Inducement to the Down-Side with SPEED
    3. Then Continues Up

    1. Build Channel Down
    2. Inducement to the Up-Side with SPEED
    3. Then Continues Down

**Reversal-Inducement-Cycle**: Induce to Continues with **SPEED** then Reversal
    1. Build Channel Up
    2. Inducement to the Up-Side with SPEED
    3. Then Reversal Down

    1. Build Channel Down
    2. Inducement to the Down-Side with SPEED
    3. Then Reversal Up

**Momentum Mitigation**: Strength Of Motion [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNfvwPCFs0]
1.Build-Up
2.Inducement
3.Mitigation

.................................
Inducement Types:
Minor Inducement  => 1min 5min
Medium Inducement => Structural Level = combination of multiple days
Major Inducement  => 15min 1hour


Inducing new High with speed => FOMO
Minor Inducement => Inducing old swing low which has not Main-Push
Medium Inducement => Has the whole push

Liquidity-Grab_Higher
Liquidity-Grab_Lower

**External-Inducement**: SHOULD NOT look at Internal-Inducement as Mitigation-Zones. It **FORMS** SMT (Smart Money Trap)
