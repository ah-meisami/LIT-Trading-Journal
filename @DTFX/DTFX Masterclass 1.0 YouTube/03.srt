1
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,460
afternoon good evening good night

2
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:08,460
how are you guys

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:11,700
um we just make sure everybody's in here

4
00:00:11,700 --> 00:00:13,679
I'm going to leave anybody in the

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,160
waiting room

6
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:23,520
good afternoon here in Cape Town you

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:25,859
know South Africa okay what's up

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:27,359
how you guys doing where you guys from

9
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:28,740
where you guys from

10
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,359
let other people don't chat

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:48,899
I'm trying to make this short because it

12
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:51,800
doesn't need to be long

13
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,500
real simple

14
00:01:09,060 --> 00:01:13,439
easy to understand and digest it's just

15
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,659
something we forget to look at

16
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:21,720
in all of uh you know button pressing

17
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:24,000
pushing

18
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,580
maybe you want to call it

19
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,200
triggering you know

20
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,880
yeah go ahead Ivan you can record it I'm

21
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:44,460
going to record it on my end too

22
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:48,200
um and release it on YouTube

23
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:50,579
and this is actually going to be the

24
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:53,340
last video that I

25
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,479
um publicly released

26
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,720
had a um cut this part out but had a

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,799
conversation with my family about

28
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,098
time you know sorry

29
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:10,639
time

30
00:02:11,459 --> 00:02:13,680
I know we all talk about time and price

31
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:16,280
but

32
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:18,060
um

33
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:20,160
in a conversation with the the stream as

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,360
well about it

35
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,580
and um I guess I was speaking to myself

36
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:26,180
in it

37
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,220
uh time time time

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,500
something that's not refundable

39
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,580
can't get it back

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,599
the time where your health was good

41
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:45,360
time when you had things

42
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:48,660
that you were able to do

43
00:02:48,660 --> 00:02:51,540
time that you just had in general time

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,260
you know

45
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,060
I think

46
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,099
with a lot of um

47
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,260
people whose

48
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:07,879
time is sort of

49
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:09,599
inspiring

50
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:11,940
because all of our time does expire I

51
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:14,099
hope you all know that

52
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:16,500
the consistent thing that you hear them

53
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:21,420
discuss let me move this uh water marker

54
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:23,159
then one thing you hear them talk about

55
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,780
is

56
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:26,519
if I go back and do something

57
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:29,220
differently I would

58
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:31,860
if I can go back I would

59
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:35,819
I would I would I would

60
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:37,440
okay

61
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,060
and a lot of it has to do with

62
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:45,420
just the fact that we don't

63
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:48,239
number our days we always think we got

64
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,280
time

65
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:52,500
so I'm not a very candid conversation

66
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,940
with my family and uh

67
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:59,099
I've been trained up some things

68
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,319
we give time to those who value those

69
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:04,560
that you know those in the group

70
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:08,360
um but outside of that my

71
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:11,580
time to have that's free

72
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:13,260
um

73
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:17,180
we'll go to fortifying

74
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:20,339
my family

75
00:04:20,339 --> 00:04:22,680
my future you know

76
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,540
so let's get right into this

77
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,660
um

78
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:34,500
a few um

79
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:36,720
you guys know the way that I teach intro

80
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,340
to Market structure by the way this is

81
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:39,540
just

82
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:42,419
a quick overview of that

83
00:04:42,419 --> 00:04:44,780
um I'm not going to go too in depth on

84
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:47,340
you know choosing zones and all that

85
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:49,800
other stuff I need people to understand

86
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:52,620
that market structure

87
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:54,300
is

88
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:58,139
pivot Points it's swing points it's

89
00:04:58,139 --> 00:05:00,259
you know whether it's higher highs

90
00:05:00,259 --> 00:05:04,320
higher lows lower highs lower lows

91
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:06,540
however it is you understand it whatever

92
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:10,380
it is you call it it's just one thing

93
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,720
it's

94
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,080
price at a beginning point

95
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
it starts somewhere where does it start

96
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:21,720
it's one point

97
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,539
one area

98
00:05:24,539 --> 00:05:27,060
there

99
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,320
that's where it begins

100
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:32,960
here

101
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:36,740
make that a little bigger there

102
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:40,880
and

103
00:05:43,940 --> 00:05:47,660
oftentimes this

104
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,080
beginning point

105
00:05:52,259 --> 00:05:55,699
it's usually in a form

106
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:01,400
of a wick

107
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:10,699
just like that

108
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:13,560
and sometimes you might see it

109
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:16,460
like this

110
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,259
sometimes you might see it like this

111
00:06:31,259 --> 00:06:32,400
something

112
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,020
along the lines of this

113
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,600
with no Wick at the bottom

114
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,240
let me just try to get a darker color

115
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,539
here

116
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,520
sometimes you might see it like this

117
00:06:56,520 --> 00:07:00,000
with no Wick present

118
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,819
down here at the bottom but this on a

119
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:05,100
higher time frame

120
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:08,000
is a wick

121
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,199
to move that wind down and immediately

122
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:11,819
came up

123
00:07:11,819 --> 00:07:15,060
once you get that close above and you

124
00:07:15,060 --> 00:07:16,860
see the two bodies that are present

125
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:18,240
there

126
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:21,360
that's a wick on a higher time frame

127
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,960
so

128
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,479
As We Know

129
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:32,940
or as I've taught

130
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:36,139
price begins

131
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,759
here

132
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,960
and you have a move that trades up right

133
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:47,300
you get a low we get a high

134
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:50,539
we get another low

135
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,699
we get a high

136
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:56,240
right

137
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,780
we get another low that's

138
00:08:00,780 --> 00:08:04,919
a low a high a lower low a higher high

139
00:08:04,919 --> 00:08:07,259
the reason why this is called a higher

140
00:08:07,259 --> 00:08:08,460
high

141
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:10,080
is because

142
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,080
it's higher than the previous High

143
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,940
this high is higher than the previous

144
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:17,819
sign now this all might sound

145
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:19,020
you know

146
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:22,139
very Elementary to to those who have

147
00:08:22,139 --> 00:08:23,520
been trading and those who understand

148
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,780
this

149
00:08:24,780 --> 00:08:27,180
but

150
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:30,720
it's important to have this in in your

151
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:31,860
mind

152
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:34,200
because

153
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,240
a lot of the times

154
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:38,899
we put in this low we put in this High

155
00:08:38,899 --> 00:08:43,260
oftentimes above a previous High

156
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,720
and I'm going to teach about you know

157
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:47,459
the the previous High what happens at

158
00:08:47,459 --> 00:08:49,440
the previous High we putting this high

159
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:51,839
above the previous High

160
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:54,560
and

161
00:08:56,519 --> 00:08:59,519
the minute we go to put in a low and

162
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,279
we're heading for another high

163
00:09:02,279 --> 00:09:04,680
we begin to see people

164
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:08,060
selling this down

165
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:10,920
placing their stops behind here

166
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,600
because we're forgetting about what

167
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:13,980
happened

168
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,839
in the past we're forget about the past

169
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,560
days so

170
00:09:19,740 --> 00:09:22,380
here is how Market structure generally

171
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:25,640
moves if this high

172
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:27,540
you have a higher low this higher low

173
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,360
isn't established until we put in

174
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,000
a higher high

175
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,220
until we break above

176
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:37,260
the previous high and we put in the

177
00:09:37,260 --> 00:09:39,180
higher high

178
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,320
now what what the market often does is

179
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:45,120
we can

180
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,320
put in a higher low

181
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:52,140
we go to put in a higher high

182
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:55,279
putting a higher low

183
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:59,060
we putting a higher high

184
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:03,800
and what some might see is

185
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:08,240
we violate the previous low

186
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:10,320
right here

187
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,580
we violate the previous validated loan

188
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,640
so when we trade up above the initial

189
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,080
High

190
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:22,080
this low becomes validated

191
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,420
once we get a body closure above the

192
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,959
previous High

193
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:30,420
so when we put in a new high

194
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:34,200
this High becomes validated

195
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,620
when we begin to pull back when we get

196
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,640
when we begin to trade back into

197
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:43,980
the previous area

198
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:46,440
now

199
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:49,500
would we call this

200
00:10:49,500 --> 00:10:51,720
we did not trade into the previous area

201
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:54,240
what we call this

202
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,459
a

203
00:10:56,459 --> 00:10:59,160
higher high a higher low and then

204
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:00,000
another

205
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,920
higher high will we call this a higher

206
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:04,200
high yes

207
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:06,660
We Will We Will acknowledge this as a

208
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:08,760
higher high and a higher low

209
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:11,760
simply because

210
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:14,160
the market is making

211
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:18,680
its high it's low it's high it's low

212
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:22,079
it's high it's low it's climbing as a

213
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:26,060
stairs a stair pattern would

214
00:11:26,399 --> 00:11:29,640
this is considered a low

215
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:33,560
and then another high present here

216
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,620
but this is not considered

217
00:11:37,620 --> 00:11:41,040
the structure of the market

218
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,680
the structure of the market

219
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:45,779
so what you have within this area let's

220
00:11:45,779 --> 00:11:47,640
say I'm on the 60 Minute time frame so

221
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:51,500
it's the uh one hour

222
00:11:52,140 --> 00:11:55,339
Within These

223
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:58,079
higher highs higher lows higher highs

224
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,480
higher lows higher highs

225
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,279
you should slow here within this pattern

226
00:12:04,279 --> 00:12:07,380
oftentimes what you see let me just

227
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:10,519
change the color of this

228
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,140
oftentimes what you see on the time

229
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,260
frames that I trade on

230
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:18,540
is a high

231
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,140
a low

232
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:23,940
a high

233
00:12:23,940 --> 00:12:26,279
hello

234
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:27,959
hi

235
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,320
hello

236
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,220
hi

237
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:34,560
and then you see

238
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,740
on this pullback you see a low violated

239
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:39,300
and I'm going to show Candlestick

240
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,899
entries to this as well

241
00:12:42,899 --> 00:12:45,899
but you see a little violated

242
00:12:45,899 --> 00:12:48,779
you see us tap back in to the previous

243
00:12:48,779 --> 00:12:50,760
area

244
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:54,120
and now we we can forming

245
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:58,399
lower lows and lower highs

246
00:12:59,579 --> 00:13:03,380
we often get to

247
00:13:03,540 --> 00:13:05,820
a particular

248
00:13:05,820 --> 00:13:08,040
area

249
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:10,860
in the larger or or the higher time

250
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:12,060
frame

251
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,740
you know order flow the higher time

252
00:13:13,740 --> 00:13:15,899
frame trend

253
00:13:15,899 --> 00:13:19,519
on the lower time frame

254
00:13:20,940 --> 00:13:24,440
you end up seeing us

255
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:28,260
what we call reverse

256
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:31,680
we trade up above

257
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,940
the previous High

258
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:38,160
so when we begin to trade up above the

259
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:39,660
previous High

260
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:41,880
we consider that

261
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:44,899
a break instruction

262
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,079
but what structure is being broken

263
00:13:52,380 --> 00:13:57,620
that's the lower time frame structure

264
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,600
are we still bullish

265
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:04,560
or sorry bearish as we're drawing back

266
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,300
from the higher time frame are we still

267
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,839
bearish

268
00:14:11,579 --> 00:14:15,480
no now we're bullish but from what time

269
00:14:15,480 --> 00:14:17,700
frame

270
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,560
on the lower time frame you'll see us

271
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,320
going to a cycle of bullishness cycle of

272
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,540
bearishness cycle of bullishness secular

273
00:14:24,540 --> 00:14:27,480
bearishness cycle of bullishness and

274
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:31,399
here's where people get wrapped up

275
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:34,320
someone might see

276
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:37,200
the high get taken

277
00:14:37,200 --> 00:14:39,720
on a lower time frame

278
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:42,060
and we're expecting

279
00:14:42,060 --> 00:14:45,720
a draw or a pullback into the area

280
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:47,940
before we continue right

281
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:49,800
because likewise

282
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:53,660
the way price Builds on

283
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:56,279
the higher time frame

284
00:14:56,279 --> 00:14:57,540
like this

285
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,040
it's the same way it builds on Lower

286
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:00,360
time frame

287
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:02,579
it's just that these

288
00:15:02,579 --> 00:15:06,380
pullbacks are a lot smaller

289
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,420
versus the higher time frame pullbacks

290
00:15:09,420 --> 00:15:12,300
can go over a series of if this is an

291
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:15,300
hourly it could be over a series of

292
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:17,519
sessions

293
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:19,800
and the following day

294
00:15:19,800 --> 00:15:22,620
you could end up getting your

295
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:25,199
higher time frame pullback

296
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:27,959
into the next day

297
00:15:27,959 --> 00:15:29,579
you get your higher time frame

298
00:15:29,579 --> 00:15:31,740
continuation

299
00:15:31,740 --> 00:15:34,940
and the following day

300
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,820
you get a higher time frame pullback

301
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,420
so depending on the time frame that you

302
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:45,380
want to trade on

303
00:15:46,560 --> 00:15:48,779
if you're trading on the 60 Minute

304
00:15:48,779 --> 00:15:51,320
chart

305
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:54,300
what you have to remember is

306
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:58,260
that depending on the type of range

307
00:15:58,260 --> 00:16:02,420
that we're in or the type of

308
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:05,420
um

309
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:09,800
sorry let me move this

310
00:16:10,500 --> 00:16:14,300
I'm gonna open this up a little more

311
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:22,019
depending on the type of range that

312
00:16:22,019 --> 00:16:23,399
we're in

313
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,240
or or the the type of Market cycle we're

314
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,420
in

315
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:36,560
you may very well see us

316
00:16:38,759 --> 00:16:43,579
trade straight up out of this

317
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:47,420
clearing these highs

318
00:16:52,740 --> 00:16:55,199
and just continuing to that higher time

319
00:16:55,199 --> 00:16:58,500
frame High

320
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,579
and then you could see

321
00:17:05,459 --> 00:17:08,880
us go straight down after

322
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:13,020
the same within the same momentum

323
00:17:13,020 --> 00:17:16,020
we come straight down

324
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,980
back to

325
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:24,179
the previous range that we were

326
00:17:24,179 --> 00:17:27,179
expecting

327
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:30,199
and what

328
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:33,440
begin

329
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,960
hi

330
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,320
hello

331
00:17:39,419 --> 00:17:41,520
hi

332
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,620
hello

333
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:45,539
hi

334
00:17:45,539 --> 00:17:47,580
hello

335
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:50,240
hi

336
00:17:55,140 --> 00:17:57,120
now let's look at where we are within

337
00:17:57,120 --> 00:18:00,919
the higher time frame trend

338
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,020
this is what

339
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:09,539
I see a lot of people getting confused

340
00:18:09,539 --> 00:18:11,900
with

341
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,260
let me bring this back this way for a

342
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,380
minute

343
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:28,020
this is what I see a lot of people

344
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:30,919
getting confused with

345
00:18:34,020 --> 00:18:37,320
you just bring this higher

346
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:40,700
take this out of the way

347
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:49,280
now

348
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:52,140
when we see this push higher and then

349
00:18:52,140 --> 00:18:55,799
push lower immediately

350
00:18:57,000 --> 00:19:01,559
are we saying that

351
00:19:02,940 --> 00:19:06,500
we're now bearish

352
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:09,299
are we now looking for the market to go

353
00:19:09,299 --> 00:19:11,820
down because we have this huge Spike up

354
00:19:11,820 --> 00:19:14,160
no

355
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:17,000
we're not

356
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:23,039
we have the market shift higher and then

357
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,280
come all the way back lower

358
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:28,799
and then we begin this uh we can see it

359
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,600
build again

360
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,160
build higher right

361
00:19:36,299 --> 00:19:39,660
a lot of the times when we're on

362
00:19:39,660 --> 00:19:43,140
this lower time frame we forget

363
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:46,340
to zoom out

364
00:19:46,440 --> 00:19:50,400
so because we watched this huge push

365
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,960
happen

366
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:55,940
followed by this huge drop

367
00:19:56,220 --> 00:19:57,720
on

368
00:19:57,720 --> 00:19:59,820
the lower time frames as we trade on I

369
00:19:59,820 --> 00:20:01,200
mean most people will follow me I

370
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,640
believe you guys trading a lower time

371
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:05,240
frames as well

372
00:20:07,559 --> 00:20:11,760
we begin to start anticipating

373
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:14,940
price trading lower

374
00:20:14,940 --> 00:20:17,460
and in our mind

375
00:20:17,460 --> 00:20:19,980
now that we've seen this whole pattern

376
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:21,900
take place

377
00:20:21,900 --> 00:20:25,440
we begin to try to

378
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:28,400
sell everything

379
00:20:29,220 --> 00:20:33,200
so we're selling in here

380
00:20:33,539 --> 00:20:35,700
and we're ending up in drawdown it's

381
00:20:35,700 --> 00:20:37,620
coming back to our entry and taking us

382
00:20:37,620 --> 00:20:42,080
higher we're moving our stops back

383
00:20:42,179 --> 00:20:44,640
and we're seeing

384
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,820
price trade all the way back up into

385
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,820
the new high

386
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,000
that that was created after

387
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,260
we broke structure to the top side

388
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:07,700
and we're being dragged

389
00:21:10,260 --> 00:21:13,700
sorry we're being dragged

390
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:22,760
into drawdown

391
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:25,919
until I stop getting or until we

392
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:28,440
manually close

393
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:32,340
because we're not paying attention to

394
00:21:32,340 --> 00:21:35,640
the higher time frame

395
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,240
so

396
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,159
another thing that happens

397
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:49,220
is when we get to the top of the range

398
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:54,380
and we go to put in a new high

399
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:01,740
we see price immediately shift lower

400
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:04,820
time back in

401
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:07,980
lower

402
00:22:07,980 --> 00:22:11,000
tap back in

403
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:13,380
should lower

404
00:22:13,380 --> 00:22:16,340
that back in

405
00:22:17,100 --> 00:22:20,840
and then we're back to

406
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:33,140
the leg that began taking us up

407
00:22:33,419 --> 00:22:36,679
would we consider

408
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:41,400
this high this new high put in

409
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:45,799
we consider that a break of structure

410
00:22:45,960 --> 00:22:50,400
to the top side to continue no

411
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:54,480
we would not if we Wicked the buff

412
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,940
and we didn't get a strong body closure

413
00:22:59,220 --> 00:23:01,500
above the previous High

414
00:23:01,500 --> 00:23:06,919
it is not considered a breakup structure

415
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,419
is not considered

416
00:23:09,419 --> 00:23:11,940
a new high neither

417
00:23:11,940 --> 00:23:15,600
is this low validated

418
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,320
because as we spoke about early on

419
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:23,220
the low gets validated

420
00:23:23,220 --> 00:23:26,340
when a new high is put in

421
00:23:26,340 --> 00:23:30,179
and if a new high is not put in

422
00:23:30,179 --> 00:23:32,100
then this low

423
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:33,600
present

424
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:36,860
is not validated

425
00:23:38,820 --> 00:23:41,520
so immediately we begin to move this

426
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,780
over soon

427
00:23:42,780 --> 00:23:45,480
immediately

428
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:49,340
we see press come back down

429
00:23:49,980 --> 00:23:53,659
to the low that brought us up

430
00:23:54,179 --> 00:23:57,480
and we see price run this inside low

431
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,960
right

432
00:24:06,299 --> 00:24:08,159
we see this

433
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:10,860
go below it

434
00:24:10,860 --> 00:24:13,640
and then

435
00:24:20,700 --> 00:24:23,840
what does the market do

436
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,520
we begin to trade higher

437
00:24:44,520 --> 00:24:47,539
just like that

438
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:54,320
you begin to trade higher

439
00:24:56,340 --> 00:24:58,500
so if

440
00:24:58,500 --> 00:25:01,200
we're looking at this now let's let's

441
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:04,280
actually just

442
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:11,780
move this for a second

443
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,039
as we're heading down

444
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:27,539
we have this belief that

445
00:25:27,539 --> 00:25:30,919
now we're bearish

446
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,440
and then we begin to see price climbing

447
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:41,960
back up to the previous High

448
00:25:43,260 --> 00:25:46,520
and we trade through it

449
00:25:48,659 --> 00:25:51,299
where is the validated low in this

450
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:53,779
scenario

451
00:25:57,960 --> 00:26:01,860
we traded up above this previous High

452
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:07,340
we violated it but we didn't validate

453
00:26:07,799 --> 00:26:11,340
the law we did violate it

454
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:13,320
but it's not considered a break of

455
00:26:13,320 --> 00:26:14,580
structure

456
00:26:14,580 --> 00:26:17,340
we ran stops from above

457
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:20,100
and then we trade it back below

458
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:22,559
and we ran stops lower

459
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:24,299
let me just bring this down just a

460
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:26,600
little more

461
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:31,760
we ran the stops below

462
00:26:37,860 --> 00:26:40,380
with price moving up

463
00:26:40,380 --> 00:26:43,760
back to this high

464
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:48,980
why did we stop here

465
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:51,919
because

466
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:57,140
our validated low

467
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,679
was actually here

468
00:27:03,299 --> 00:27:07,400
and all we did was come back to

469
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:10,020
hey I'm not going to zone so I'm just

470
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,059
going to briefly remember this we

471
00:27:12,059 --> 00:27:15,200
briefly mentioned this sorry

472
00:27:15,659 --> 00:27:19,640
all we're doing is coming back to

473
00:27:22,440 --> 00:27:24,240
the demand

474
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:26,460
that broke structure

475
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:28,799
or the low

476
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:32,960
that violated the high

477
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:37,340
this low is valid

478
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:44,240
until you hear that until

479
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:49,640
we get a body closure below it

480
00:27:51,299 --> 00:27:53,279
or

481
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:58,340
we get a break of structure above it

482
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:01,919
so what we often see and get wrapped up

483
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:04,140
in

484
00:28:04,140 --> 00:28:07,039
is

485
00:28:07,620 --> 00:28:10,140
the lows and the highs being

486
00:28:10,140 --> 00:28:14,539
created and broken on a lower time frame

487
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:24,299
without looking at what our higher time

488
00:28:24,299 --> 00:28:26,640
frame

489
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,980
order flow is what our top what our

490
00:28:28,980 --> 00:28:30,659
higher time frame highs and lows are

491
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:33,000
telling us

492
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:36,179
so when you guys see me so zoomed out

493
00:28:36,179 --> 00:28:37,140
um

494
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,059
you know when I'm when I'm trading lead

495
00:28:39,059 --> 00:28:43,200
it's to pay attention to that

496
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,840
what I'm doing here let me just move

497
00:28:45,840 --> 00:28:47,400
this again sorry

498
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,919
what I'm doing here when you guys see

499
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:55,020
see the chart zoomed out like this what

500
00:28:55,020 --> 00:28:58,940
I'm doing here is I'm noting

501
00:28:59,039 --> 00:29:02,159
the low is down here on the higher time

502
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,440
frame

503
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:08,539
the high that's present

504
00:29:08,580 --> 00:29:12,440
the low that's present

505
00:29:12,720 --> 00:29:14,279
and

506
00:29:14,279 --> 00:29:19,620
while on the time frame I'm on

507
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:22,760
I'm seeing

508
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,860
the high get broken

509
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:30,620
here

510
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:37,399
and we come back to put in a low

511
00:29:40,559 --> 00:29:44,460
what we're not seeing from

512
00:29:44,460 --> 00:29:47,960
the higher time frame

513
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:51,120
remember on the lower time frame this

514
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:52,620
pushed

515
00:29:52,620 --> 00:29:54,539
straight up

516
00:29:54,539 --> 00:29:58,820
and it came straight back down right

517
00:30:00,419 --> 00:30:02,159
but somebody not really seeing from the

518
00:30:02,159 --> 00:30:03,840
higher time frame is the same thing that

519
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:06,620
I just mentioned

520
00:30:06,659 --> 00:30:09,679
opening up

521
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:20,600
we have this high that takes this up

522
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:29,480
and we have this low that brings us down

523
00:30:36,120 --> 00:30:39,240
so what is this considered now with the

524
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:41,580
higher time frame View

525
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:45,740
and what we opened up talking about

526
00:30:47,399 --> 00:30:51,440
this on the higher time frame

527
00:30:52,260 --> 00:30:55,220
looks like

528
00:30:59,820 --> 00:31:03,919
one candle a wick

529
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:08,659
it's just a wick flushing above

530
00:31:18,059 --> 00:31:21,740
but on the lower time frame

531
00:31:24,620 --> 00:31:29,120
it's a full structure break

532
00:31:32,039 --> 00:31:35,120
it's a cool structure break

533
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,659
so

534
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:41,520
if you guys

535
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:45,299
watch the Zero to Hero course and the

536
00:31:45,299 --> 00:31:47,279
Zero to Hero video and the intro to

537
00:31:47,279 --> 00:31:50,179
Market structure video

538
00:31:50,580 --> 00:31:52,260
you guys will get a better understanding

539
00:31:52,260 --> 00:31:54,960
of how these lower time frame highs and

540
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:56,039
lows

541
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,480
are

542
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,419
delivering the higher time frame

543
00:32:00,419 --> 00:32:03,059
highs and lows

544
00:32:03,059 --> 00:32:06,260
but one thing that

545
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:08,820
we noted earlier this week let me

546
00:32:08,820 --> 00:32:10,500
actually

547
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,380
get rid of this

548
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:17,360
this is the hourly time frame

549
00:32:20,279 --> 00:32:23,840
if we go down to the one minute

550
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:31,580
actually let me

551
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:35,179
if you go down to the one minute

552
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:42,799
some of this out of here

553
00:32:46,500 --> 00:32:50,240
because I briefly went over this

554
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:53,100
on one of the streams

555
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:56,419
earlier this week

556
00:32:57,059 --> 00:32:59,520
we see now that we have a series of

557
00:32:59,520 --> 00:33:02,600
highs and lows right

558
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:07,980
to use the pies in those

559
00:33:07,980 --> 00:33:12,980
but now we're as zoomed out as

560
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:17,299
I usually am when I'm

561
00:33:17,460 --> 00:33:19,200
you know when I'm trading you guys might

562
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:21,059
see little things like this that I know

563
00:33:21,059 --> 00:33:23,279
it out you know just the little things

564
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:25,380
that I dropped this way or

565
00:33:25,380 --> 00:33:27,539
or I might take something larger like

566
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:30,419
this and you know I might draw this out

567
00:33:30,419 --> 00:33:32,700
here you know you guys are just seeing

568
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:35,460
lines but what I'm paying attention to

569
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,080
is

570
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,080
the higher time frame highs and lows if

571
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:42,919
I go back to the

572
00:33:43,559 --> 00:33:46,140
the one hour

573
00:33:46,140 --> 00:33:49,919
what do we see here oh it's easy

574
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:52,740
it's easier to follow

575
00:33:52,740 --> 00:33:55,740
the highs and lows from here

576
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:59,120
based on the one hour

577
00:34:01,080 --> 00:34:04,200
we have this low here

578
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,360
we have this High here

579
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:09,000
body closure above right

580
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,879
but these candlesticks take a couple of

581
00:34:11,879 --> 00:34:13,980
hours to form so here we have one hour

582
00:34:13,980 --> 00:34:16,918
two hour three hour

583
00:34:16,918 --> 00:34:19,500
four hour

584
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:21,780
that brings us up above the previous

585
00:34:21,780 --> 00:34:25,199
High takes us four hours

586
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,060
to violate this high

587
00:34:27,060 --> 00:34:28,739
and then what

588
00:34:28,739 --> 00:34:32,598
we immediately go into a range

589
00:34:32,699 --> 00:34:35,159
oftentimes

590
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:37,918
you know London Asia

591
00:34:37,918 --> 00:34:40,619
gives us these smaller hourly candles

592
00:34:40,619 --> 00:34:44,099
not as much volume in

593
00:34:44,099 --> 00:34:46,379
but if we're paying attention to a

594
00:34:46,379 --> 00:34:48,899
higher time frame

595
00:34:48,899 --> 00:34:51,179
highs and lows

596
00:34:51,179 --> 00:34:54,300
we see that we have a low present here

597
00:34:54,300 --> 00:34:57,599
we have a high above here

598
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:01,500
we put in a low here right

599
00:35:01,500 --> 00:35:03,180
and then

600
00:35:03,180 --> 00:35:06,480
we put in another high why is this High

601
00:35:06,480 --> 00:35:09,020
put in

602
00:35:10,380 --> 00:35:14,220
why is this low validated

603
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:15,780
because according to what we just

604
00:35:15,780 --> 00:35:18,320
explained

605
00:35:18,540 --> 00:35:21,300
we have

606
00:35:21,300 --> 00:35:25,500
our low after the break-in structure

607
00:35:25,500 --> 00:35:27,480
full body closure

608
00:35:27,480 --> 00:35:31,160
then we have our high

609
00:35:31,500 --> 00:35:34,920
that broke structure and we have a full

610
00:35:34,920 --> 00:35:36,839
body closure above

611
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:39,000
so what happens

612
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:41,280
after this is put in when you guys saw

613
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,339
me bring up this chart you saw

614
00:35:44,339 --> 00:35:48,500
these highs and lows present here

615
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,820
These Eyes on those present here

616
00:35:53,339 --> 00:35:56,460
now again this is over a series of days

617
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:59,160
here's Friday

618
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:02,040
here's Sunday

619
00:36:02,040 --> 00:36:04,200
here's Monday

620
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:06,240
and within the same day you could you

621
00:36:06,240 --> 00:36:07,980
can get a high and low put in depending

622
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,960
on if there's high impact news or

623
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,160
something like that

624
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:14,180
but here's Monday

625
00:36:15,240 --> 00:36:19,579
we get a pullback into Asia's

626
00:36:19,800 --> 00:36:22,140
the Asian session on Monday

627
00:36:22,140 --> 00:36:25,140
and the next low is put in

628
00:36:25,140 --> 00:36:27,720
on Tuesday

629
00:36:27,720 --> 00:36:29,760
so we're following the higher time frame

630
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,140
highs and lows these are happening

631
00:36:31,140 --> 00:36:33,060
across multiple sessions and potentially

632
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,980
across multiple days as we mentioned

633
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:37,820
earlier in Nvidia

634
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:44,760
we violate this low

635
00:36:44,760 --> 00:36:49,099
we get a strong close below

636
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:54,560
we put in this

637
00:36:54,660 --> 00:36:57,720
low right here

638
00:36:57,720 --> 00:37:00,720
we put in a high

639
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:03,859
but what did we mention

640
00:37:04,079 --> 00:37:08,339
about our highs and lows

641
00:37:08,339 --> 00:37:10,380
we mentioned that we needed a body

642
00:37:10,380 --> 00:37:12,480
closure

643
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:15,119
below it

644
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,520
in order to validate

645
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:19,260
the high

646
00:37:19,260 --> 00:37:21,900
we need a body closure below

647
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:25,220
so what do we get here

648
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:28,980
we put in this low

649
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:31,020
and we don't get a body closure until

650
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:33,300
here

651
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,700
from the higher time frame we don't get

652
00:37:35,700 --> 00:37:38,040
a body closure until here

653
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:40,700
so

654
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:45,660
is this high

655
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:48,500
validated

656
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,660
no

657
00:37:51,660 --> 00:37:53,640
it's not

658
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,880
this inside high is invalidated so what

659
00:37:56,880 --> 00:37:59,460
high do we need

660
00:37:59,460 --> 00:38:02,480
to rerun

661
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:05,820
in order to consider it a breakup

662
00:38:05,820 --> 00:38:07,680
structure

663
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:11,119
and a reversal in price

664
00:38:11,579 --> 00:38:14,480
we need the last

665
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:17,960
validated High

666
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:21,359
to be violated

667
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:24,119
this High did not get violent validated

668
00:38:24,119 --> 00:38:26,420
sorry

669
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:28,500
because

670
00:38:28,500 --> 00:38:31,440
a closure below was not given just a

671
00:38:31,440 --> 00:38:33,680
wick

672
00:38:36,480 --> 00:38:39,079
so

673
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:43,440
we end up putting in a load through Asia

674
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:45,780
I believe this is Asia yeah putting it

675
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:47,700
low through Asia

676
00:38:47,700 --> 00:38:49,619
but then immediately running and taken

677
00:38:49,619 --> 00:38:51,800
out

678
00:38:53,579 --> 00:38:56,040
hour High

679
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:59,900
or what would have been on high

680
00:39:01,619 --> 00:39:06,500
should we have a closure below this low

681
00:39:11,940 --> 00:39:14,820
so now if we follow it

682
00:39:14,820 --> 00:39:18,200
this low comes in

683
00:39:18,599 --> 00:39:21,540
and puts in this high above

684
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:24,320
right here

685
00:39:41,220 --> 00:39:45,020
here was where the low started

686
00:39:46,079 --> 00:39:48,960
we put in a high

687
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,839
we shifted below

688
00:39:51,839 --> 00:39:55,700
we shifted back above the high

689
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:04,320
and we see that we're in a Range

690
00:40:04,320 --> 00:40:08,880
so now what we're paying attention to is

691
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:11,280
our load that was left behind on Friday

692
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,560
Friday's low

693
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:17,900
that we did not break to continue down

694
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,820
and we took out the intermediary inside

695
00:40:20,820 --> 00:40:22,920
High

696
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:24,660
you guys hear me talk about that in in

697
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:27,560
Zero to Hero

698
00:40:29,820 --> 00:40:33,560
so when did we get

699
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:38,480
a breaking close of Friday's low

700
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:42,540
that's here

701
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:45,859
Monday morning 9am

702
00:40:49,619 --> 00:40:52,680
so now you take

703
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:55,800
our Friday loan

704
00:40:55,800 --> 00:40:57,960
and the highest point

705
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:02,700
of the market before the break this is

706
00:41:02,700 --> 00:41:04,740
considered manipulation we just Wicked

707
00:41:04,740 --> 00:41:06,359
through

708
00:41:06,359 --> 00:41:09,119
been traded back up above so we'll take

709
00:41:09,119 --> 00:41:11,339
the highest point

710
00:41:11,339 --> 00:41:15,260
because that's oftentimes where

711
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:20,220
the institutional stops are the

712
00:41:20,220 --> 00:41:23,160
protected stops

713
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:28,200
we call it in intro to Market structure

714
00:41:28,200 --> 00:41:33,300
a protected High and a protected low

715
00:41:33,300 --> 00:41:36,440
so when we came in

716
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:39,780
to this scene here you guys see me have

717
00:41:39,780 --> 00:41:41,579
this High here

718
00:41:41,579 --> 00:41:43,800
and then you see me at this low

719
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,480
here

720
00:41:45,480 --> 00:41:47,820
right

721
00:41:47,820 --> 00:41:51,260
so if we follow this

722
00:41:59,040 --> 00:42:01,140
we put in this low

723
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:03,780
we put in this high

724
00:42:03,780 --> 00:42:06,119
this low is validated

725
00:42:06,119 --> 00:42:10,160
because it's after the break instruction

726
00:42:12,180 --> 00:42:14,520
this low is validated the minute we go

727
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,079
up

728
00:42:16,079 --> 00:42:20,220
and trade above to put in a new high

729
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,740
this high is not validated

730
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,599
until we trade below

731
00:42:27,599 --> 00:42:30,920
and put in a new low

732
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:32,820
so if you see where I put this yellow

733
00:42:32,820 --> 00:42:34,619
line at

734
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:37,740
you see we have a wick

735
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:40,920
that trades below it

736
00:42:40,920 --> 00:42:43,260
like this it will wake that trades below

737
00:42:43,260 --> 00:42:45,000
it

738
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:48,480
and then we get a body closure

739
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:50,400
shortly after

740
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:53,099
you just zoom in some

741
00:42:53,099 --> 00:42:56,960
we get a body closure

742
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:01,280
so after that body closure

743
00:43:01,319 --> 00:43:03,000
you see us

744
00:43:03,000 --> 00:43:07,500
Wick below and then trade back up above

745
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,780
to put in

746
00:43:09,780 --> 00:43:12,500
a high

747
00:43:15,359 --> 00:43:18,720
but the high that we need

748
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:22,040
to get taken

749
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:26,480
is the protected High

750
00:43:32,579 --> 00:43:35,640
the protected high is above up here

751
00:43:35,640 --> 00:43:38,280
because this High the protected High the

752
00:43:38,280 --> 00:43:40,859
validated High

753
00:43:40,859 --> 00:43:44,940
is what's created when the body

754
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:47,520
closes below

755
00:43:47,520 --> 00:43:49,920
the previous low

756
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:53,119
then put that high in

757
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,579
so we get a body closure below

758
00:43:56,579 --> 00:43:58,200
and then look

759
00:43:58,200 --> 00:44:01,140
we get a wick going down and price shift

760
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:02,760
back up

761
00:44:02,760 --> 00:44:05,640
what I mentioned earlier

762
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:08,660
was important

763
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:12,560
because

764
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,920
this Wick

765
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:21,300
that came down below is a body closure

766
00:44:21,300 --> 00:44:24,800
on a lower time frame

767
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,599
it's that same

768
00:44:27,599 --> 00:44:32,099
move going down into the move going up

769
00:44:32,099 --> 00:44:35,119
it's the same

770
00:44:39,619 --> 00:44:43,760
bearish Candle Going Down

771
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:48,200
sorry bearish Candle Going Down

772
00:44:54,359 --> 00:44:58,859
into a bullish candle going up

773
00:44:58,859 --> 00:45:02,599
on a higher time frame

774
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:13,380
but all this is from the higher time

775
00:45:13,380 --> 00:45:15,680
frame

776
00:45:28,460 --> 00:45:31,940
there's a wick

777
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,560
so

778
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,359
if we had counted

779
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:45,180
this high above on a higher time on a

780
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:47,099
lower time frame sorry we cut it this

781
00:45:47,099 --> 00:45:48,839
high above on a lower time frame as a

782
00:45:48,839 --> 00:45:50,220
high

783
00:45:50,220 --> 00:45:52,099
and then we saw this low put in

784
00:45:52,099 --> 00:45:54,960
immediately when we traded up above this

785
00:45:54,960 --> 00:45:56,280
high

786
00:45:56,280 --> 00:45:57,720
on a lower time frame we would

787
00:45:57,720 --> 00:46:01,500
automatically assume that this was

788
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:05,060
the case to go bullish

789
00:46:08,040 --> 00:46:11,420
if we go back to it

790
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:17,060
we would assume that this was the case

791
00:46:17,160 --> 00:46:21,079
to go bullish right

792
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,800
you have this

793
00:46:25,800 --> 00:46:30,859
push down below price shifts up above

794
00:46:30,960 --> 00:46:33,859
and now

795
00:46:34,740 --> 00:46:37,440
when we take out

796
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:42,480
this higher time frame High

797
00:46:42,480 --> 00:46:44,339
this is a higher time frame high but

798
00:46:44,339 --> 00:46:46,440
it's an inside High when we take that

799
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:48,680
out

800
00:46:51,720 --> 00:46:54,560
it's right here

801
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,420
when we take that out now

802
00:47:04,020 --> 00:47:08,240
we're believing that this is bullish

803
00:47:08,280 --> 00:47:09,900
we're believing that price is coming

804
00:47:09,900 --> 00:47:12,240
back into here

805
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:15,000
to trade higher

806
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,940
and what do we get price runs below

807
00:47:17,940 --> 00:47:20,220
and continues lower

808
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:22,520
right

809
00:47:24,119 --> 00:47:26,579
because according to

810
00:47:26,579 --> 00:47:30,359
our higher time frame

811
00:47:30,359 --> 00:47:34,520
the protected high is up here

812
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,359
and anything

813
00:47:36,359 --> 00:47:38,520
between

814
00:47:38,520 --> 00:47:39,960
the low

815
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:43,400
and the protected High

816
00:47:43,500 --> 00:47:45,660
is a range

817
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:48,500
that we're in

818
00:47:49,859 --> 00:47:52,319
likewise when I explained the drawing up

819
00:47:52,319 --> 00:47:55,579
above earlier in the video

820
00:47:56,339 --> 00:47:58,980
it showed

821
00:47:58,980 --> 00:48:02,280
a double bottom in it

822
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:03,720
but

823
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,640
no closure above

824
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:12,960
so if we pay attention to

825
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:16,260
the last validated low and validated

826
00:48:16,260 --> 00:48:18,619
High

827
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:21,720
we know that before we have any belief

828
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:23,700
that that

829
00:48:23,700 --> 00:48:25,859
price is reversing

830
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:30,300
we need to take out our higher time

831
00:48:30,300 --> 00:48:33,839
frame validated lows our higher time

832
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:34,680
frame

833
00:48:34,680 --> 00:48:37,680
validated highs

834
00:48:37,680 --> 00:48:39,300
and that's whether in a downtrend

835
00:48:39,300 --> 00:48:40,859
whether an uptrend

836
00:48:40,859 --> 00:48:44,280
where you take out the higher time frame

837
00:48:44,280 --> 00:48:46,020
lows there's a higher time frame low

838
00:48:46,020 --> 00:48:50,700
take out the higher time frame low

839
00:48:50,700 --> 00:48:55,140
before we believe that

840
00:48:55,200 --> 00:48:57,180
we're now reversing to go into a

841
00:48:57,180 --> 00:48:59,460
downtrend

842
00:48:59,460 --> 00:49:02,520
and if you stay on this side of the

843
00:49:02,520 --> 00:49:04,440
market

844
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:07,800
you have more opportunities

845
00:49:07,800 --> 00:49:10,920
to hold longer more opportunities to

846
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,839
gain more profit in the direction that

847
00:49:12,839 --> 00:49:15,720
price is actually going versus trying to

848
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:20,359
time the bottom or time to top

849
00:49:21,060 --> 00:49:23,700
a lot of the traders who you know trade

850
00:49:23,700 --> 00:49:26,220
with me who learn from me desire to hold

851
00:49:26,220 --> 00:49:27,839
longer moves

852
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:33,480
and those longer moods are only present

853
00:49:33,480 --> 00:49:36,180
from

854
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:39,660
higher time frame areas

855
00:49:39,660 --> 00:49:41,640
you want to take one trade and hold an

856
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,020
intraday move and you don't want to be a

857
00:49:43,020 --> 00:49:45,300
part of every single turn of the market

858
00:49:45,300 --> 00:49:48,420
that you guys see me you know kind of

859
00:49:48,420 --> 00:49:49,500
noting

860
00:49:49,500 --> 00:49:51,839
this is what you would keep on your

861
00:49:51,839 --> 00:49:53,880
chart

862
00:49:53,880 --> 00:49:55,500
you'd keep

863
00:49:55,500 --> 00:49:58,260
the higher time frame highs the higher

864
00:49:58,260 --> 00:50:00,839
time frame lows and a downtrend as well

865
00:50:00,839 --> 00:50:03,660
as the higher time frame highs and the

866
00:50:03,660 --> 00:50:05,520
higher time frame lows

867
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:07,140
in an uptrend

868
00:50:07,140 --> 00:50:10,880
because we have the same thing here

869
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:19,440
well I won't get into that I'll just get

870
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,920
into the

871
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:26,119
the meat of this portion down here

872
00:50:27,119 --> 00:50:30,500
we have a low present here

873
00:50:32,760 --> 00:50:34,500
we have a high present here this is

874
00:50:34,500 --> 00:50:36,119
following lower time for Mortar flow now

875
00:50:36,119 --> 00:50:39,420
we have a little present here

876
00:50:39,420 --> 00:50:42,859
we have a high present here

877
00:50:43,319 --> 00:50:46,079
we have a low present here

878
00:50:46,079 --> 00:50:49,020
and then we get that run remember with a

879
00:50:49,020 --> 00:50:52,220
run up above

880
00:50:53,099 --> 00:50:56,660
we have a high present here

881
00:50:57,480 --> 00:51:00,420
we put in a series of lows below but we

882
00:51:00,420 --> 00:51:03,020
don't get

883
00:51:03,780 --> 00:51:07,400
a break and structure

884
00:51:07,800 --> 00:51:12,839
until a body closure happens above what

885
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:16,460
the the validated High

886
00:51:16,680 --> 00:51:19,319
this high is validated

887
00:51:19,319 --> 00:51:21,780
when a pullback it says

888
00:51:21,780 --> 00:51:24,660
and this high is broken when a body

889
00:51:24,660 --> 00:51:25,800
closes

890
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,680
above from the continuation

891
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:32,300
so what do we end up in here

892
00:51:34,859 --> 00:51:38,359
we end up having this high

893
00:51:39,960 --> 00:51:43,520
with no closure above

894
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:48,380
multiple times throughout this session

895
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:52,500
no closure above we traded up above here

896
00:51:52,500 --> 00:51:54,960
at 7am

897
00:51:54,960 --> 00:51:57,240
traded up above again at

898
00:51:57,240 --> 00:52:02,420
10 A.M traded up above at 11AM

899
00:52:03,359 --> 00:52:06,839
and he keeps seeing us go above

900
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,460
you keep seeing us straight above this

901
00:52:08,460 --> 00:52:10,260
high

902
00:52:10,260 --> 00:52:13,140
but we also don't come back to

903
00:52:13,140 --> 00:52:16,339
the validated low

904
00:52:16,859 --> 00:52:19,319
so in order to now

905
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:21,660
have a bias that

906
00:52:21,660 --> 00:52:24,599
we should be looking to go short

907
00:52:24,599 --> 00:52:26,819
we would need to violate

908
00:52:26,819 --> 00:52:29,599
this low

909
00:52:30,420 --> 00:52:33,839
we trade near it trade back above the

910
00:52:33,839 --> 00:52:36,960
high we trade back down below

911
00:52:36,960 --> 00:52:38,940
and then you see us trade back above the

912
00:52:38,940 --> 00:52:42,180
high and close

913
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:45,720
that validates this low here

914
00:52:45,720 --> 00:52:47,819
but what happens after that what we just

915
00:52:47,819 --> 00:52:49,619
explained

916
00:52:49,619 --> 00:52:52,220
earlier

917
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:55,680
we close

918
00:52:55,680 --> 00:52:59,420
validating this low right

919
00:53:00,300 --> 00:53:03,420
and we put in this high

920
00:53:03,420 --> 00:53:06,559
we trade lower

921
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,000
validating this high

922
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,980
and then we trade above the validated

923
00:53:10,980 --> 00:53:14,220
high and break structure

924
00:53:14,220 --> 00:53:16,920
to validate the low

925
00:53:16,920 --> 00:53:20,220
now what do we end up having

926
00:53:20,220 --> 00:53:24,059
a strong close below

927
00:53:24,059 --> 00:53:26,760
validated level

928
00:53:26,760 --> 00:53:29,819
so while

929
00:53:29,819 --> 00:53:33,720
a ton of people would be looking to

930
00:53:33,720 --> 00:53:38,119
you know take Longs all out of here

931
00:53:40,380 --> 00:53:44,480
we need to understand that

932
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:48,140
what just happened

933
00:53:51,059 --> 00:53:54,720
was that between this low and this high

934
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:57,300
price just reversed

935
00:53:57,300 --> 00:53:59,339
I just broke structure it says a

936
00:53:59,339 --> 00:54:01,500
downside

937
00:54:01,500 --> 00:54:04,680
now these these areas in here

938
00:54:04,680 --> 00:54:06,540
you know these are called imbalances

939
00:54:06,540 --> 00:54:09,839
these just this large candle

940
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:12,000
with no wick on either side of the

941
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,140
candle

942
00:54:13,140 --> 00:54:14,700
these are called imbalances that teach

943
00:54:14,700 --> 00:54:16,200
those in the course but again I'm just

944
00:54:16,200 --> 00:54:18,900
going through Market structure

945
00:54:18,900 --> 00:54:21,420
that's it just Market structure alone

946
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:23,280
the rest of the course will supplement

947
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:24,839
all the other things that you need to

948
00:54:24,839 --> 00:54:27,660
trade with but Market structure

949
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:31,859
you need to keep that at the Forefront

950
00:54:31,859 --> 00:54:34,579
of your mind

951
00:54:36,599 --> 00:54:39,200
so

952
00:54:41,099 --> 00:54:44,240
as you see

953
00:54:51,420 --> 00:54:55,520
from the stream that we did last week

954
00:54:59,160 --> 00:55:02,339
we talked about the lows

955
00:55:02,339 --> 00:55:04,619
because

956
00:55:04,619 --> 00:55:06,540
those

957
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:09,540
highs

958
00:55:13,500 --> 00:55:16,020
lows

959
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:18,720
highs

960
00:55:18,720 --> 00:55:21,000
lows

961
00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:27,500
highs this is clearly in a downtrend

962
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:30,780
and it's a downtrend that begun

963
00:55:30,780 --> 00:55:35,359
from Friday May 19th

964
00:55:37,800 --> 00:55:42,140
all the way into the 25th

965
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:47,520
all the way into the 25th

966
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:51,020
we were just trending downward

967
00:55:51,240 --> 00:55:55,400
and if you kept these highs and lows

968
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:58,260
where you need it to you you had a

969
00:55:58,260 --> 00:56:00,859
marker on it

970
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,859
you would understand that the positions

971
00:56:04,859 --> 00:56:06,960
that you were taking up

972
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:10,140
had they been short positions

973
00:56:10,140 --> 00:56:12,359
they would have yielded you a lot more

974
00:56:12,359 --> 00:56:14,640
profit

975
00:56:14,640 --> 00:56:18,839
to hold than trying to find the bottom

976
00:56:18,839 --> 00:56:21,240
of everything all of these bottoms were

977
00:56:21,240 --> 00:56:22,500
temporary

978
00:56:22,500 --> 00:56:25,140
every single bottom temporary temporary

979
00:56:25,140 --> 00:56:29,160
temporary temporary temporary temporary

980
00:56:29,160 --> 00:56:32,160
temporary temporary

981
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:36,260
every one of them were temporary

982
00:56:36,780 --> 00:56:40,220
until we took out

983
00:56:41,160 --> 00:56:44,540
a validated High

984
00:56:49,619 --> 00:56:51,300
let me

985
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:53,880
get rid of some of this sorry until we

986
00:56:53,880 --> 00:56:56,960
took out a validated High

987
00:57:01,140 --> 00:57:04,579
from the higher time frame

988
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:09,500
let's go back to this hourly

989
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:23,900
let's follow it

990
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:30,020
we have this low here

991
00:57:31,079 --> 00:57:33,059
we put in

992
00:57:33,059 --> 00:57:35,520
a high right here

993
00:57:35,520 --> 00:57:37,260
on Candlestick structure if you don't

994
00:57:37,260 --> 00:57:38,520
know what that is you hear that in video

995
00:57:38,520 --> 00:57:40,819
one

996
00:57:41,400 --> 00:57:44,819
and we close below it bam we put in a

997
00:57:44,819 --> 00:57:47,000
low

998
00:57:48,300 --> 00:57:51,059
after this low is put in

999
00:57:51,059 --> 00:57:54,079
we put in a high

1000
00:57:55,260 --> 00:57:58,460
and we trade below

1001
00:58:01,619 --> 00:58:04,079
and this here

1002
00:58:04,079 --> 00:58:09,980
is where you see us validate this high

1003
00:58:10,140 --> 00:58:12,359
so we trade up above

1004
00:58:12,359 --> 00:58:16,200
when we get the body closure below

1005
00:58:16,200 --> 00:58:18,660
we'll get the body closure below

1006
00:58:18,660 --> 00:58:21,720
we trade up above and then we violate

1007
00:58:21,720 --> 00:58:25,099
bam down there

1008
00:58:25,800 --> 00:58:29,300
this becomes validated

1009
00:58:29,819 --> 00:58:32,400
so when we come down

1010
00:58:32,400 --> 00:58:35,480
we put in the low

1011
00:58:36,119 --> 00:58:38,099
and then we trade again

1012
00:58:38,099 --> 00:58:40,319
and put in the high

1013
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:41,640
right

1014
00:58:41,640 --> 00:58:43,740
when do we validate

1015
00:58:43,740 --> 00:58:46,319
this high

1016
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:48,299
we put in this low

1017
00:58:48,299 --> 00:58:51,180
body closure below

1018
00:58:51,180 --> 00:58:54,500
high is validated

1019
00:58:55,859 --> 00:58:58,460
so

1020
00:59:03,059 --> 00:59:06,319
we put in this low

1021
00:59:07,079 --> 00:59:09,299
and then we trade up above this high

1022
00:59:09,299 --> 00:59:11,819
right here

1023
00:59:11,819 --> 00:59:14,460
does that high get validated this this

1024
00:59:14,460 --> 00:59:16,619
high right here

1025
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:19,740
does this high at the at the green line

1026
00:59:19,740 --> 00:59:22,920
does it get validated

1027
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:27,140
well let's see the low that put it in

1028
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:31,760
do we get a body closure below yes

1029
00:59:32,339 --> 00:59:35,839
you get a body closure below

1030
00:59:37,260 --> 00:59:38,880
at this let me just make it a different

1031
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,160
color

1032
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:43,200
yellow line

1033
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:45,839
we get a body closure below

1034
00:59:45,839 --> 00:59:49,220
full body closure below

1035
00:59:49,799 --> 00:59:53,780
and when we trade up above

1036
01:00:00,119 --> 01:00:02,760
you see a wick

1037
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:06,200
Lush up above it

1038
01:00:06,660 --> 01:00:08,220
and then

1039
01:00:08,220 --> 01:00:11,119
shift lower

1040
01:00:13,559 --> 01:00:15,059
so

1041
01:00:15,059 --> 01:00:16,680
this high

1042
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:18,020
here

1043
01:00:18,020 --> 01:00:21,680
remains validated

1044
01:00:22,859 --> 01:00:24,359
and it's not

1045
01:00:24,359 --> 01:00:27,599
broken it's not a break of structure

1046
01:00:27,599 --> 01:00:30,380
because

1047
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:33,900
there's a wick that comes above it but

1048
01:00:33,900 --> 01:00:36,980
we don't get it close

1049
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:41,000
where does the clothes come in

1050
01:00:42,420 --> 01:00:45,740
the clothes comes in

1051
01:00:46,020 --> 01:00:50,119
on the body of this candle here

1052
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:57,079
so the minute we get a close above

1053
01:00:58,020 --> 01:00:59,400
now

1054
01:00:59,400 --> 01:01:03,859
our higher time frame order flow

1055
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:08,460
has just given us bullish clothes above

1056
01:01:08,460 --> 01:01:11,480
just like over here

1057
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:17,240
down here

1058
01:01:18,359 --> 01:01:21,359
we shifted higher

1059
01:01:21,359 --> 01:01:23,220
we had a bullish close above the

1060
01:01:23,220 --> 01:01:25,819
previous High

1061
01:01:25,980 --> 01:01:29,720
and then we violated the low

1062
01:01:31,500 --> 01:01:34,559
now we have a bearish close below

1063
01:01:34,559 --> 01:01:38,299
and we began a downtrend

1064
01:01:41,460 --> 01:01:45,440
so now we have a bullish close above

1065
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:50,599
and what are our expectations now

1066
01:01:53,460 --> 01:01:57,720
or a pair like this this is us-30

1067
01:01:57,720 --> 01:01:59,040
um when you guys see me try it on stream

1068
01:01:59,040 --> 01:02:01,559
is usually not as dead

1069
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:03,839
but these same principles apply to

1070
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:06,079
everything

1071
01:02:06,780 --> 01:02:09,720
according to the one hour

1072
01:02:09,720 --> 01:02:12,420
now we have

1073
01:02:12,420 --> 01:02:14,760
a reason

1074
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,700
to now go long

1075
01:02:17,700 --> 01:02:20,040
we have a reason to now

1076
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:21,420
be

1077
01:02:21,420 --> 01:02:24,319
bullish

1078
01:02:25,079 --> 01:02:28,260
so now we begin

1079
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:33,079
looking for some upside

1080
01:02:39,240 --> 01:02:41,940
and in the

1081
01:02:41,940 --> 01:02:44,700
the videos that

1082
01:02:44,700 --> 01:02:49,079
you know I've shared with you guys um

1083
01:02:49,079 --> 01:02:53,720
it'll go more into detail with this

1084
01:02:54,420 --> 01:02:58,260
but I wanted to you know release this to

1085
01:02:58,260 --> 01:02:59,940
you guys talk to you guys about this

1086
01:02:59,940 --> 01:03:02,099
because

1087
01:03:02,099 --> 01:03:03,900
you know a lot of the times I were

1088
01:03:03,900 --> 01:03:07,380
losing in the market or our days where

1089
01:03:07,380 --> 01:03:10,500
you know we we have a rough time

1090
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:14,160
it's because the lens in which we're

1091
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:17,579
viewing the market is a bit

1092
01:03:17,579 --> 01:03:20,700
off a bit skewed

1093
01:03:20,700 --> 01:03:24,260
and it's skewed because

1094
01:03:25,140 --> 01:03:28,380
we're not paying attention to

1095
01:03:28,380 --> 01:03:31,440
the market structure and and for those

1096
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:34,200
who who still have trouble reading

1097
01:03:34,200 --> 01:03:36,420
the the one minute time frame that you

1098
01:03:36,420 --> 01:03:38,339
guys see me trade on

1099
01:03:38,339 --> 01:03:40,920
it's

1100
01:03:40,920 --> 01:03:42,960
because you may not necessarily

1101
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:45,480
understand order flow

1102
01:03:45,480 --> 01:03:47,099
order flow

1103
01:03:47,099 --> 01:03:50,280
teaches you

1104
01:03:50,280 --> 01:03:52,440
you know the one minute time frame order

1105
01:03:52,440 --> 01:03:55,619
flow is what I teach more so in the

1106
01:03:55,619 --> 01:03:57,780
mentorship

1107
01:03:57,780 --> 01:04:00,119
structure

1108
01:04:00,119 --> 01:04:03,839
teaches you what side of the market you

1109
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:06,480
want to be on in the sessions we love to

1110
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,940
trade the the New York session or or

1111
01:04:08,940 --> 01:04:12,180
within news or whatever it is news will

1112
01:04:12,180 --> 01:04:13,740
still follow

1113
01:04:13,740 --> 01:04:15,900
bearish order flow all of these Wicks

1114
01:04:15,900 --> 01:04:18,839
that you see at the top let me just

1115
01:04:18,839 --> 01:04:20,579
all of these Wicks that you see at the

1116
01:04:20,579 --> 01:04:21,720
top

1117
01:04:21,720 --> 01:04:23,880
go back to a bunch of the the news

1118
01:04:23,880 --> 01:04:27,420
events go back to the market open

1119
01:04:27,420 --> 01:04:30,960
you know uh uh sessions

1120
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:32,640
either Market open times for the New

1121
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:34,020
York session

1122
01:04:34,020 --> 01:04:38,099
you'll see that a lot of these wicks

1123
01:04:38,099 --> 01:04:42,420
represent either news

1124
01:04:42,480 --> 01:04:46,680
or Market open news or Market open news

1125
01:04:46,680 --> 01:04:49,579
or Market open

1126
01:04:52,500 --> 01:04:55,400
and

1127
01:04:55,619 --> 01:04:58,559
these are the areas

1128
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,540
that people are getting lost in this

1129
01:05:00,540 --> 01:05:02,520
awesome

1130
01:05:02,520 --> 01:05:04,559
these up moves and then you see the

1131
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,339
market shift down

1132
01:05:08,579 --> 01:05:11,460
these are the the sessions

1133
01:05:11,460 --> 01:05:13,020
that people are getting tripped up on

1134
01:05:13,020 --> 01:05:16,140
even through through London this is 4

1135
01:05:16,140 --> 01:05:19,079
a.m here London

1136
01:05:19,079 --> 01:05:20,640
3 A.M coming

1137
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,579
who Bears 4 AM takes us up and then we

1138
01:05:23,579 --> 01:05:26,299
still ship lower

1139
01:05:28,980 --> 01:05:31,079
New York session takes us up we still

1140
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:33,559
shift lower

1141
01:05:35,640 --> 01:05:40,740
and we're not paying attention to

1142
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:49,140
we're not paying attention to where we

1143
01:05:49,140 --> 01:05:51,980
are in structure

1144
01:05:52,920 --> 01:05:57,319
what we're doing is paying attention to

1145
01:05:57,839 --> 01:06:02,359
that strong move that we get up

1146
01:06:03,140 --> 01:06:06,240
strong move that we get up and we

1147
01:06:06,240 --> 01:06:07,680
believe we're trading higher and then

1148
01:06:07,680 --> 01:06:11,299
the market immediately takes us down

1149
01:06:13,079 --> 01:06:15,540
strong move that we get up we we think

1150
01:06:15,540 --> 01:06:17,280
we're trading higher the market

1151
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,420
immediately takes this down

1152
01:06:20,460 --> 01:06:23,400
and it happens almost

1153
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:26,640
every morning with within within these

1154
01:06:26,640 --> 01:06:30,539
these sessions strong move up

1155
01:06:30,539 --> 01:06:34,880
and then we immediately get taken down

1156
01:06:35,339 --> 01:06:38,700
because we're on the wrong side of the

1157
01:06:38,700 --> 01:06:39,900
market

1158
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:43,740
we're on the side of the market that's

1159
01:06:43,740 --> 01:06:46,500
giving us these

1160
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:49,020
these pushers to the top but we have not

1161
01:06:49,020 --> 01:06:51,839
broken any structure to the top side to

1162
01:06:51,839 --> 01:06:53,400
even

1163
01:06:53,400 --> 01:06:57,059
say that okay yeah we're

1164
01:06:57,059 --> 01:07:00,359
we're you know bullish

1165
01:07:00,359 --> 01:07:03,000
we should start expecting some upside we

1166
01:07:03,000 --> 01:07:04,920
should get into an entry that we can

1167
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,260
hold

1168
01:07:07,260 --> 01:07:10,380
we're holding these entries

1169
01:07:10,380 --> 01:07:14,579
for moves that are not present

1170
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:17,760
so as you guys see I'll you know teach

1171
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:19,440
through the course on the lower time

1172
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:21,960
frame I'll I'll teach on a one minute

1173
01:07:21,960 --> 01:07:23,819
you know show you guys things on the one

1174
01:07:23,819 --> 01:07:25,140
minute

1175
01:07:25,140 --> 01:07:27,180
um but this

1176
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:30,539
Market structure belongs to

1177
01:07:30,539 --> 01:07:33,359
the higher time frame

1178
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:37,380
order flow belongs to the lower time

1179
01:07:37,380 --> 01:07:39,059
frame

1180
01:07:39,059 --> 01:07:41,880
so in the course I'm giving you guys an

1181
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:43,740
introduction into

1182
01:07:43,740 --> 01:07:45,900
order flow

1183
01:07:45,900 --> 01:07:48,839
but it gets deeper than that and a lot

1184
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:50,940
of people are mixing up Market structure

1185
01:07:50,940 --> 01:07:52,680
with

1186
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,260
order flow and

1187
01:07:55,260 --> 01:07:59,160
though there's order flow present

1188
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:02,400
in Market structure Market structure

1189
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:07,579
comes from the higher time frame

1190
01:08:08,220 --> 01:08:12,180
the lower time frame is order flow that

1191
01:08:12,180 --> 01:08:14,039
delivers

1192
01:08:14,039 --> 01:08:16,979
higher time frame structure to you

1193
01:08:16,979 --> 01:08:21,019
or or to where it's going

1194
01:08:22,198 --> 01:08:24,719
so when we're in these these intraday

1195
01:08:24,719 --> 01:08:27,420
moves these one minute moves or or these

1196
01:08:27,420 --> 01:08:29,939
these five minute time frame moves

1197
01:08:29,939 --> 01:08:34,500
we have to be cognizant and aware of

1198
01:08:34,500 --> 01:08:35,939
what

1199
01:08:35,939 --> 01:08:39,660
the higher time frame structure actually

1200
01:08:39,660 --> 01:08:42,020
is

1201
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,560
because if we're on the lower time frame

1202
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:48,359
and

1203
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:51,299
we see a high get taken like like for

1204
01:08:51,299 --> 01:08:54,020
instance here

1205
01:08:54,299 --> 01:08:56,819
you have this High ran here you have

1206
01:08:56,819 --> 01:08:59,219
this low put in right here

1207
01:08:59,219 --> 01:09:02,880
you have this higher end here by this

1208
01:09:02,880 --> 01:09:06,560
and then we still trade lower

1209
01:09:07,259 --> 01:09:10,020
we still trade back below so everybody's

1210
01:09:10,020 --> 01:09:11,640
looking for price to come back into

1211
01:09:11,640 --> 01:09:15,839
previous ranges you know discussing

1212
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:19,920
um you know the course

1213
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:21,779
and they're longing everything getting

1214
01:09:21,779 --> 01:09:24,420
out getting taken out a break even long

1215
01:09:24,420 --> 01:09:26,399
getting taken out of break even longer

1216
01:09:26,399 --> 01:09:28,859
than taking taking out a break even

1217
01:09:28,859 --> 01:09:30,479
they're getting

1218
01:09:30,479 --> 01:09:33,179
trapped under here or their stops are

1219
01:09:33,179 --> 01:09:34,620
getting hit under here because they

1220
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:36,719
think that we're ready to reverse from

1221
01:09:36,719 --> 01:09:39,179
some area through here

1222
01:09:39,179 --> 01:09:41,580
but

1223
01:09:41,580 --> 01:09:43,799
Market structure from the higher time

1224
01:09:43,799 --> 01:09:46,160
frame

1225
01:09:46,979 --> 01:09:50,539
says that we're still short

1226
01:09:54,360 --> 01:09:57,060
so as a as a scalper if you want to

1227
01:09:57,060 --> 01:09:59,900
scalp intraday

1228
01:10:01,380 --> 01:10:03,060
you could use these little one minute

1229
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:05,580
moves but if you want to hold on to

1230
01:10:05,580 --> 01:10:08,219
these you know

1231
01:10:08,219 --> 01:10:10,340
um

1232
01:10:11,219 --> 01:10:15,199
200 Point moves you know 150 Point moves

1233
01:10:15,199 --> 01:10:18,660
you need to understand what the market

1234
01:10:18,660 --> 01:10:21,780
structure is for the pair that you're

1235
01:10:21,780 --> 01:10:24,239
trading the market structure does not

1236
01:10:24,239 --> 01:10:26,880
come from the one minute it does not

1237
01:10:26,880 --> 01:10:30,000
come from the lower time frame

1238
01:10:30,000 --> 01:10:32,400
the microstructure comes from the higher

1239
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,260
time frame

1240
01:10:34,260 --> 01:10:36,840
so you might see people wait to take two

1241
01:10:36,840 --> 01:10:39,300
three setups within a week

1242
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:41,460
those setups are based on higher time

1243
01:10:41,460 --> 01:10:44,600
frame Market structure

1244
01:10:45,360 --> 01:10:47,820
and they may not necessarily know how to

1245
01:10:47,820 --> 01:10:50,640
read lower time from order flow so you

1246
01:10:50,640 --> 01:10:52,199
have to

1247
01:10:52,199 --> 01:10:54,719
you know be honest with yourself and ask

1248
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:56,900
yourself

1249
01:10:58,140 --> 01:11:03,000
do you know how to read Market structure

1250
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:05,719
first

1251
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:08,600
and then

1252
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:12,300
you work on order flow after

1253
01:11:12,300 --> 01:11:14,280
if you don't know how to be profitable

1254
01:11:14,280 --> 01:11:17,280
in higher time frame structure

1255
01:11:17,280 --> 01:11:18,960
that it's not going to be possible to be

1256
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:21,179
profitable with lower time frame order

1257
01:11:21,179 --> 01:11:22,440
flow

1258
01:11:22,440 --> 01:11:24,179
because the lower time frame order flow

1259
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:27,600
delivers the higher time frame structure

1260
01:11:27,600 --> 01:11:29,960
the lower time frame order flow

1261
01:11:29,960 --> 01:11:34,640
delivers the higher time frame structure

1262
01:11:34,860 --> 01:11:36,600
so if you're not profitable with major

1263
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,820
structure then this

1264
01:11:38,820 --> 01:11:41,159
range this intermediary structure that

1265
01:11:41,159 --> 01:11:42,300
you see

1266
01:11:42,300 --> 01:11:44,640
it'll be very difficult being profitable

1267
01:11:44,640 --> 01:11:47,120
with it

1268
01:11:47,219 --> 01:11:50,460
because you don't have

1269
01:11:50,460 --> 01:11:53,640
the higher time frame

1270
01:11:53,640 --> 01:11:55,440
in

1271
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:58,640
in the back of your mind

1272
01:11:59,460 --> 01:12:02,460
because along the higher time frame

1273
01:12:02,460 --> 01:12:05,420
areas

1274
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,659
you'll have far more

1275
01:12:09,659 --> 01:12:12,360
profitable entries

1276
01:12:12,360 --> 01:12:16,400
whether it's here

1277
01:12:18,120 --> 01:12:20,340
whether it's taking

1278
01:12:20,340 --> 01:12:21,540
you know

1279
01:12:21,540 --> 01:12:23,940
rejection out of the

1280
01:12:23,940 --> 01:12:27,060
the validated 15-minute low

1281
01:12:27,060 --> 01:12:30,020
down to here

1282
01:12:33,300 --> 01:12:34,920
whether it's

1283
01:12:34,920 --> 01:12:37,260
taking an entry

1284
01:12:37,260 --> 01:12:41,460
from the violated 15 minute low here

1285
01:12:41,460 --> 01:12:43,980
down to here

1286
01:12:43,980 --> 01:12:46,980
was taking an entry on a retest

1287
01:12:46,980 --> 01:12:51,480
the area that took structure

1288
01:12:51,480 --> 01:12:54,179
down to here

1289
01:12:54,179 --> 01:12:57,300
was taking the entry from

1290
01:12:57,300 --> 01:12:58,920
the

1291
01:12:58,920 --> 01:13:01,739
retest of the retest

1292
01:13:01,739 --> 01:13:03,840
down to here

1293
01:13:03,840 --> 01:13:05,940
you look at a lot of these moves within

1294
01:13:05,940 --> 01:13:10,820
here that are just highlighted and

1295
01:13:12,600 --> 01:13:15,719
they don't have

1296
01:13:15,719 --> 01:13:19,920
moves coming back to the stop or or you

1297
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:21,900
know to the entry

1298
01:13:21,900 --> 01:13:23,820
based on the The Zone you're trading

1299
01:13:23,820 --> 01:13:26,280
they don't have moves coming back then

1300
01:13:26,280 --> 01:13:29,960
in the video you'll hear me talk about

1301
01:13:30,120 --> 01:13:31,920
first half break structure to the

1302
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,600
downside second tap gives you a double

1303
01:13:33,600 --> 01:13:36,360
top and then short

1304
01:13:36,360 --> 01:13:38,400
those have to be in zones where are

1305
01:13:38,400 --> 01:13:40,199
those zones coming from higher time

1306
01:13:40,199 --> 01:13:42,179
frame

1307
01:13:42,179 --> 01:13:46,760
what do those higher time frame zones

1308
01:13:47,280 --> 01:13:50,900
where do they have to be

1309
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:55,620
those higher time frame zones have to be

1310
01:13:55,620 --> 01:13:58,080
according to what the market structure

1311
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:01,260
is on that higher time frame you're just

1312
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:03,000
not taking any Supply from the higher

1313
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,400
time frame and just oh here's the supply

1314
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:08,580
I'm gonna short within this Supply and

1315
01:14:08,580 --> 01:14:11,719
then it rips through that Supply

1316
01:14:11,820 --> 01:14:14,340
I'm gonna long from this demand and then

1317
01:14:14,340 --> 01:14:17,600
it rips through that demand

1318
01:14:20,640 --> 01:14:23,100
you need to be sure and I teach this in

1319
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:25,140
the in the playlist as well you need to

1320
01:14:25,140 --> 01:14:27,420
be sure

1321
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:30,239
that the demand Zone you're choosing

1322
01:14:30,239 --> 01:14:33,000
that the supply that you're choosing

1323
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:34,800
lines up

1324
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:36,719
with

1325
01:14:36,719 --> 01:14:43,280
the higher time frame Market structure

1326
01:14:44,460 --> 01:14:46,800
so if you're struggling with being able

1327
01:14:46,800 --> 01:14:48,420
to trade order flow in the lower time

1328
01:14:48,420 --> 01:14:50,100
frame

1329
01:14:50,100 --> 01:14:52,739
maybe need to look into following

1330
01:14:52,739 --> 01:14:54,600
higher time frame Market structure

1331
01:14:54,600 --> 01:14:57,120
before you jump into the lower time

1332
01:14:57,120 --> 01:14:58,020
frame

1333
01:14:58,020 --> 01:14:59,760
order flow

1334
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:01,800
lower time frame order flow is a lot

1335
01:15:01,800 --> 01:15:02,880
different

1336
01:15:02,880 --> 01:15:04,500
than a higher time frame Barber

1337
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:06,600
structure

1338
01:15:06,600 --> 01:15:11,219
it's a lot different it is the same once

1339
01:15:11,219 --> 01:15:12,840
you begin to understand the fractal

1340
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:15,679
nature of price

1341
01:15:16,260 --> 01:15:20,239
which I explained in Zero to Hero

1342
01:15:24,120 --> 01:15:25,860
would you start to understand it frankly

1343
01:15:25,860 --> 01:15:27,120
it

1344
01:15:27,120 --> 01:15:28,620
moves through all the different time

1345
01:15:28,620 --> 01:15:30,179
frames but the order flow is very

1346
01:15:30,179 --> 01:15:33,020
specific

1347
01:15:33,179 --> 01:15:35,780
because

1348
01:15:41,280 --> 01:15:45,020
let me show you guys this over here

1349
01:15:48,179 --> 01:15:51,300
uh yikes

1350
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:54,500
this can happen

1351
01:15:55,560 --> 01:15:57,600
you see this shift in Market structure

1352
01:15:57,600 --> 01:15:58,560
here

1353
01:15:58,560 --> 01:16:01,739
this low taken out

1354
01:16:01,739 --> 01:16:04,199
this can happen

1355
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:07,280
on the one minute

1356
01:16:07,500 --> 01:16:11,120
and still trade higher

1357
01:16:11,280 --> 01:16:12,659
so

1358
01:16:12,659 --> 01:16:15,120
you can have your high your low your

1359
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,860
high your low you're high

1360
01:16:19,320 --> 01:16:23,840
you can get a violation of the low

1361
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:28,640
pop back in and then trade higher

1362
01:16:31,380 --> 01:16:33,840
so you were looking for a market

1363
01:16:33,840 --> 01:16:36,900
structure shift

1364
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:40,460
on the lower time frame

1365
01:16:40,860 --> 01:16:44,040
but if you don't understand order flow

1366
01:16:44,040 --> 01:16:45,780
you'll get Market structure shifts

1367
01:16:45,780 --> 01:16:48,179
everywhere

1368
01:16:48,179 --> 01:16:51,360
on a downside from the top side back

1369
01:16:51,360 --> 01:16:53,460
within here somewhere back up here

1370
01:16:53,460 --> 01:16:55,440
somewhere

1371
01:16:55,440 --> 01:16:59,719
down through here you know through here

1372
01:17:04,980 --> 01:17:07,800
so it's not just

1373
01:17:07,800 --> 01:17:09,960
Market structure shifts that you're

1374
01:17:09,960 --> 01:17:13,800
chasing on the one minute it's it's

1375
01:17:13,800 --> 01:17:16,500
you have to understand the order flow

1376
01:17:16,500 --> 01:17:18,900
delivery on the one minute and how it

1377
01:17:18,900 --> 01:17:22,760
gets to the higher time frame areas

1378
01:17:22,980 --> 01:17:24,719
I talk about us getting to a higher time

1379
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,480
frame area and then trading away from it

1380
01:17:27,480 --> 01:17:29,340
remember we get to a higher time frame

1381
01:17:29,340 --> 01:17:32,699
high and then we trade away from it

1382
01:17:32,699 --> 01:17:34,739
we don't immediately violate it we trade

1383
01:17:34,739 --> 01:17:37,260
away from it go back into the

1384
01:17:37,260 --> 01:17:39,840
the low and then you can see us Trade Up

1385
01:17:39,840 --> 01:17:41,699
Above

1386
01:17:41,699 --> 01:17:43,320
and not even come back to test that

1387
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:46,219
demand like it did here

1388
01:17:47,820 --> 01:17:49,440
we get to this higher time frame High

1389
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:51,980
here

1390
01:17:53,340 --> 01:17:54,840
it's violet

1391
01:17:54,840 --> 01:17:57,679
what happens here

1392
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,060
we trade lower

1393
01:18:03,360 --> 01:18:06,840
and then we had to violate it

1394
01:18:06,840 --> 01:18:08,640
and there are times where we don't even

1395
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:10,560
come back to it

1396
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,600
price go open up tomorrow tap back into

1397
01:18:12,600 --> 01:18:16,140
here I mean yeah yeah tomorrow

1398
01:18:16,140 --> 01:18:19,260
thank God for market open on Sundays tap

1399
01:18:19,260 --> 01:18:20,699
back in here

1400
01:18:20,699 --> 01:18:23,960
and continue higher

1401
01:18:24,360 --> 01:18:27,860
doesn't even come back within

1402
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,840
you know your your Zone that you're

1403
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,699
looking to come in your your demand that

1404
01:18:32,699 --> 01:18:34,140
you're looking for come back and tap it

1405
01:18:34,140 --> 01:18:35,400
through your balance that you're looking

1406
01:18:35,400 --> 01:18:38,040
for to come back into nothing you might

1407
01:18:38,040 --> 01:18:40,320
get into you know it might start just

1408
01:18:40,320 --> 01:18:43,320
chewing up these areas up here

1409
01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:45,719
rejecting back down pushing up there

1410
01:18:45,719 --> 01:18:48,300
running that low there heading back up

1411
01:18:48,300 --> 01:18:50,760
above to the high tapping back in here

1412
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,400
and the whole time you stop hoping that

1413
01:18:53,400 --> 01:18:55,020
it comes back into

1414
01:18:55,020 --> 01:18:56,760
your little demands on them down here

1415
01:18:56,760 --> 01:18:59,300
and it doesn't

1416
01:19:04,440 --> 01:19:06,179
but you didn't know how to get involved

1417
01:19:06,179 --> 01:19:09,360
when it doesn't come back

1418
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:12,000
what happens if

1419
01:19:12,000 --> 01:19:14,100
you had this low here and price never

1420
01:19:14,100 --> 01:19:16,560
came back up here to test the supply

1421
01:19:16,560 --> 01:19:18,480
that was left behind

1422
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:21,480
could you get involved with that

1423
01:19:21,480 --> 01:19:25,159
could you take a trade based on that

1424
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:29,659
or do you just have to wait

1425
01:19:30,300 --> 01:19:32,699
look at where where Bitcoin is at right

1426
01:19:32,699 --> 01:19:34,820
now

1427
01:19:37,800 --> 01:19:40,080
you just get rid of this yeah look at

1428
01:19:40,080 --> 01:19:43,159
what Bitcoins are right now

1429
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:51,719
if price doesn't make it back into this

1430
01:19:51,719 --> 01:19:53,040
area

1431
01:19:53,040 --> 01:19:55,560
into this Zone

1432
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:57,960
and it continues higher

1433
01:19:57,960 --> 01:20:01,760
is there a way for you to get involved

1434
01:20:02,940 --> 01:20:05,219
let's say it just it just let me

1435
01:20:05,219 --> 01:20:08,540
actually just got another shot

1436
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,760
let's say you just

1437
01:20:14,760 --> 01:20:18,260
trades higher from here

1438
01:20:18,420 --> 01:20:21,000
are you trying to

1439
01:20:21,000 --> 01:20:23,100
you know let's say come up here are you

1440
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:25,140
trying to get involved in been a long

1441
01:20:25,140 --> 01:20:26,760
hair to go up there

1442
01:20:26,760 --> 01:20:28,320
and then why'd you come down and run

1443
01:20:28,320 --> 01:20:30,600
your stop

1444
01:20:30,600 --> 01:20:33,179
no you you got to find ways to get in

1445
01:20:33,179 --> 01:20:36,060
when the market does not pull back

1446
01:20:36,060 --> 01:20:38,520
sometimes there's a lot of activities a

1447
01:20:38,520 --> 01:20:39,900
lot of involvement

1448
01:20:39,900 --> 01:20:42,120
you saw what pushed us up to these areas

1449
01:20:42,120 --> 01:20:45,800
the banking crisis

1450
01:20:46,860 --> 01:20:48,960
you started launching us out of this

1451
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:50,580
area everybody was like oh there's a

1452
01:20:50,580 --> 01:20:52,199
double top on bitcoin we're coming back

1453
01:20:52,199 --> 01:20:54,920
down to 10K

1454
01:20:55,440 --> 01:20:58,020
if anybody ever shortened this Yeet I'm

1455
01:20:58,020 --> 01:21:01,880
pretty ready to try to short this yeet

1456
01:21:04,199 --> 01:21:08,719
because what is the what's the

1457
01:21:11,040 --> 01:21:13,739
what's the structure obviously you know

1458
01:21:13,739 --> 01:21:17,420
nobody nobody would be trading from

1459
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:19,560
you know the weekly or monthly I hope

1460
01:21:19,560 --> 01:21:20,640
not

1461
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,960
but what's the structure here

1462
01:21:24,540 --> 01:21:27,620
was destruction here

1463
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,719
structure for the higher time frame is

1464
01:21:33,719 --> 01:21:38,480
from the the monthlies bearish yes

1465
01:21:40,020 --> 01:21:43,100
but within here

1466
01:21:44,159 --> 01:21:48,020
we have these highs and lows

1467
01:21:48,179 --> 01:21:51,420
we get a closure above here

1468
01:21:51,420 --> 01:21:54,540
and then we violate

1469
01:21:54,540 --> 01:21:56,400
so we end up violate and put in this

1470
01:21:56,400 --> 01:21:58,440
short we put in this time

1471
01:21:58,440 --> 01:22:00,360
we come back down let me just make sure

1472
01:22:00,360 --> 01:22:03,000
we validated that

1473
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:06,199
yeah we validated it

1474
01:22:06,659 --> 01:22:08,460
we putting this low

1475
01:22:08,460 --> 01:22:10,380
we putting this high

1476
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:14,179
we come back down close below it

1477
01:22:14,880 --> 01:22:17,960
we validated

1478
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,280
a higher time frame High

1479
01:22:20,280 --> 01:22:22,080
but since nobody's trading Bitcoin from

1480
01:22:22,080 --> 01:22:24,480
the weekly in the monthly and we trade

1481
01:22:24,480 --> 01:22:27,080
intraday

1482
01:22:28,199 --> 01:22:31,199
or or you know even a little bit of

1483
01:22:31,199 --> 01:22:32,460
Swing trading that could end up being

1484
01:22:32,460 --> 01:22:36,260
open like a day or two or so

1485
01:22:38,940 --> 01:22:41,040
we realized that we get a shift in

1486
01:22:41,040 --> 01:22:43,760
structure here

1487
01:22:46,620 --> 01:22:49,739
after we get a shift and the the market

1488
01:22:49,739 --> 01:22:52,440
structure that we trade with not that we

1489
01:22:52,440 --> 01:22:55,020
invest with

1490
01:22:55,020 --> 01:22:57,239
the microstructure that we trade with

1491
01:22:57,239 --> 01:22:58,800
because when you get into the weekly and

1492
01:22:58,800 --> 01:23:01,500
monthly that's where the investing

1493
01:23:01,500 --> 01:23:05,040
portion comes in you want to invest from

1494
01:23:05,040 --> 01:23:07,620
the weekly in the monthly you want to

1495
01:23:07,620 --> 01:23:09,960
trade from

1496
01:23:09,960 --> 01:23:13,199
the four hour one hour

1497
01:23:13,199 --> 01:23:16,260
I'd say more of the 15 minute in one

1498
01:23:16,260 --> 01:23:19,020
hour but you know this you know to your

1499
01:23:19,020 --> 01:23:20,940
palette

1500
01:23:20,940 --> 01:23:23,699
but we get a shift

1501
01:23:23,699 --> 01:23:25,620
in this and now all of the crypto

1502
01:23:25,620 --> 01:23:27,480
Traders

1503
01:23:27,480 --> 01:23:29,880
oh double top yup we're coming down to

1504
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,400
this oh double top again yep we're gonna

1505
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:33,960
make sure we're gonna come down and run

1506
01:23:33,960 --> 01:23:37,880
and just get in wrecked each time

1507
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:41,699
oh double bottom yeah we we're

1508
01:23:41,699 --> 01:23:44,760
definitely going up to 100 gazillion and

1509
01:23:44,760 --> 01:23:47,580
then running their lows

1510
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:50,699
because they have no idea

1511
01:23:50,699 --> 01:23:52,199
what

1512
01:23:52,199 --> 01:23:56,699
the higher time frame structure is

1513
01:23:56,699 --> 01:23:58,620
according to the time frame that they're

1514
01:23:58,620 --> 01:24:00,060
trading on the time frame that they're

1515
01:24:00,060 --> 01:24:02,900
entering on

1516
01:24:03,540 --> 01:24:05,940
you're not entering if you let's say you

1517
01:24:05,940 --> 01:24:08,100
were taking a monthly trade so you're

1518
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,440
taking a weekly trade

1519
01:24:10,440 --> 01:24:12,659
you're not answering a weekly trade from

1520
01:24:12,659 --> 01:24:15,300
a one minute time frame

1521
01:24:15,300 --> 01:24:18,120
yeah I'm going long here

1522
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:20,460
right now and I'm gonna place my stop

1523
01:24:20,460 --> 01:24:24,920
right behind the Zone here on the daily

1524
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:28,140
because I'm gonna get up to the

1525
01:24:28,140 --> 01:24:29,820
the 36

1526
01:24:29,820 --> 01:24:31,920
000 now and then you stop gets popped

1527
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:34,219
don't worry

1528
01:24:37,260 --> 01:24:39,239
Market structures for different modes of

1529
01:24:39,239 --> 01:24:41,760
trading for different modes of investing

1530
01:24:41,760 --> 01:24:45,320
Market structures for that too

1531
01:24:45,540 --> 01:24:47,520
but I I break this up down and of course

1532
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:49,940
you know

1533
01:24:53,940 --> 01:24:55,560
just want to help you guys understand

1534
01:24:55,560 --> 01:24:58,560
that that if you guys want to be Traders

1535
01:24:58,560 --> 01:25:02,420
especially in intraday Traders

1536
01:25:02,940 --> 01:25:04,920
you need to know what your higher time

1537
01:25:04,920 --> 01:25:07,880
frame is saying

1538
01:25:10,980 --> 01:25:12,420
because no one's saying that you can't

1539
01:25:12,420 --> 01:25:14,699
short in these areas

1540
01:25:14,699 --> 01:25:16,500
but for the most for for most of the

1541
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:18,420
people that trade they want to hold on

1542
01:25:18,420 --> 01:25:20,520
to

1543
01:25:20,520 --> 01:25:23,040
an entry throughout the session

1544
01:25:23,040 --> 01:25:24,960
throughout the

1545
01:25:24,960 --> 01:25:26,219
um

1546
01:25:26,219 --> 01:25:28,199
whether it's a day or two you know hold

1547
01:25:28,199 --> 01:25:30,719
on to a long move holding to you know

1548
01:25:30,719 --> 01:25:32,699
100 points or you know your account size

1549
01:25:32,699 --> 01:25:34,980
may not be an account size that could

1550
01:25:34,980 --> 01:25:37,560
benefit off of 10 points

1551
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:40,020
but I can benefit off of 15 points you

1552
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:41,880
might need

1553
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:45,360
your account size to to you know build

1554
01:25:45,360 --> 01:25:47,520
based on holding maybe 100 Point moves

1555
01:25:47,520 --> 01:25:49,980
200 Point moves whatever it is

1556
01:25:49,980 --> 01:25:52,980
you can get those intraday

1557
01:25:52,980 --> 01:25:54,360
would you have to be in the right spot

1558
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:57,199
at the right moment

1559
01:25:57,540 --> 01:26:01,320
so when I teach zones inside of the

1560
01:26:01,320 --> 01:26:05,280
course you want those zones to correlate

1561
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:06,360
with

1562
01:26:06,360 --> 01:26:08,699
what the structure is I also go to

1563
01:26:08,699 --> 01:26:11,400
higher time frame structure as well

1564
01:26:11,400 --> 01:26:12,420
but

1565
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,980
I need people to understand that

1566
01:26:13,980 --> 01:26:16,500
direction is very very important even if

1567
01:26:16,500 --> 01:26:18,960
you're early sometimes you just early

1568
01:26:18,960 --> 01:26:21,659
does you know wrong you're just early

1569
01:26:21,659 --> 01:26:23,760
you look over here Dow

1570
01:26:23,760 --> 01:26:27,600
right here we had a huge pump

1571
01:26:27,600 --> 01:26:31,580
right here how much is this what's this

1572
01:26:32,400 --> 01:26:35,840
we had a huge pump

1573
01:26:36,560 --> 01:26:40,100
117 points

1574
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:45,980
that might be good for the day

1575
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:49,800
let me see what day this is this is

1576
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:52,400
Thursday

1577
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,699
so we had a huge pump

1578
01:26:56,699 --> 01:27:00,500
sorry we had a huge pump

1579
01:27:09,600 --> 01:27:12,239
but now

1580
01:27:12,239 --> 01:27:14,760
when we get back into the zone that we

1581
01:27:14,760 --> 01:27:18,260
teach in the course by the way

1582
01:27:18,420 --> 01:27:21,860
you want to be on the right side

1583
01:27:22,440 --> 01:27:24,840
so London gave us that push that last

1584
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:27,320
push

1585
01:27:28,020 --> 01:27:31,219
and then New York

1586
01:27:33,780 --> 01:27:36,060
the right side to be on in the market

1587
01:27:36,060 --> 01:27:38,600
was

1588
01:27:40,260 --> 01:27:42,780
to be on the long side Well everybody's

1589
01:27:42,780 --> 01:27:44,699
calling for the market crash oh yeah

1590
01:27:44,699 --> 01:27:47,040
it's going down yeah Joey B he

1591
01:27:47,040 --> 01:27:50,100
definitely governed like a weak senior

1592
01:27:50,100 --> 01:27:52,199
out man you know like all the stuff that

1593
01:27:52,199 --> 01:27:53,880
they got to say about him

1594
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:56,340
you know the listen Republicans are

1595
01:27:56,340 --> 01:27:58,080
buying these buying these stocks

1596
01:27:58,080 --> 01:28:01,679
Democrat Democrats buying these stocks

1597
01:28:01,679 --> 01:28:04,560
you know all The Independents buying

1598
01:28:04,560 --> 01:28:05,639
these stocks

1599
01:28:05,639 --> 01:28:08,159
whether you you know

1600
01:28:08,159 --> 01:28:10,679
black white asian

1601
01:28:10,679 --> 01:28:12,719
whether you want to be what you want to

1602
01:28:12,719 --> 01:28:15,000
be you know

1603
01:28:15,000 --> 01:28:17,760
the guy said he identified as a 30 year

1604
01:28:17,760 --> 01:28:19,980
old and he was 69 I don't know how that

1605
01:28:19,980 --> 01:28:21,960
worked but you know

1606
01:28:21,960 --> 01:28:24,120
whatever it is you want to be

1607
01:28:24,120 --> 01:28:27,840
whatever these people are that

1608
01:28:27,840 --> 01:28:30,739
is

1609
01:28:31,080 --> 01:28:34,460
there's nothing to do with

1610
01:28:35,040 --> 01:28:37,860
the money being put in here we all in

1611
01:28:37,860 --> 01:28:39,360
this same Market just like we all live

1612
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:40,739
in the same world we all live in the

1613
01:28:40,739 --> 01:28:42,840
same Market we all have the same

1614
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:44,580
Tendencies we all have the same emotions

1615
01:28:44,580 --> 01:28:46,980
we all see the same things we all have

1616
01:28:46,980 --> 01:28:50,060
the same impulses

1617
01:28:50,699 --> 01:28:54,199
so paying attention to that

1618
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:56,880
oh yeah the the default the debt the

1619
01:28:56,880 --> 01:28:59,460
debt seal and default is Lumen

1620
01:28:59,460 --> 01:29:01,520
um yeah I I get that you said that

1621
01:29:01,520 --> 01:29:05,100
ceiling default is Lumen and

1622
01:29:05,100 --> 01:29:07,139
America ain't gonna be able to pay his

1623
01:29:07,139 --> 01:29:09,840
bills did you come June 1st but the

1624
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,800
market ain't saying that

1625
01:29:14,520 --> 01:29:16,980
Market structure is not speaking that

1626
01:29:16,980 --> 01:29:19,280
language

1627
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:25,860
so when you pay attention to to Market

1628
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:28,639
structure that

1629
01:29:29,159 --> 01:29:31,500
that gives you your Edge

1630
01:29:31,500 --> 01:29:34,679
that gives you a place to start in

1631
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:36,480
and what you don't understand it just

1632
01:29:36,480 --> 01:29:38,699
know that

1633
01:29:38,699 --> 01:29:40,139
you know there's parts of Market

1634
01:29:40,139 --> 01:29:42,960
structure that you may not understand if

1635
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:45,300
you look here

1636
01:29:45,300 --> 01:29:47,400
let's get some of this other chart look

1637
01:29:47,400 --> 01:29:48,480
here

1638
01:29:48,480 --> 01:29:50,880
you have this low here

1639
01:29:50,880 --> 01:29:54,060
and you have this High here

1640
01:29:54,060 --> 01:29:57,000
so this is from

1641
01:29:57,000 --> 01:30:00,800
Thursday just before Market open

1642
01:30:01,440 --> 01:30:05,300
and this is from Wednesday Asia

1643
01:30:07,800 --> 01:30:09,780
yes from Wednesday Wednesday Asian

1644
01:30:09,780 --> 01:30:11,340
session

1645
01:30:11,340 --> 01:30:14,219
this had tons of volume man this was

1646
01:30:14,219 --> 01:30:16,440
beautiful actually

1647
01:30:16,440 --> 01:30:20,280
London opened up took us down

1648
01:30:20,280 --> 01:30:23,159
New York brought us back up and down

1649
01:30:23,159 --> 01:30:25,560
then back up again

1650
01:30:25,560 --> 01:30:27,420
there are times where you may not

1651
01:30:27,420 --> 01:30:29,639
understand this you may not understand

1652
01:30:29,639 --> 01:30:31,860
that we're just in a Range

1653
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:34,560
you may not understand how to read this

1654
01:30:34,560 --> 01:30:36,300
so

1655
01:30:36,300 --> 01:30:38,639
when you're in here

1656
01:30:38,639 --> 01:30:42,300
you might be looking to go long

1657
01:30:42,300 --> 01:30:45,659
and then you're taking out a break even

1658
01:30:45,659 --> 01:30:47,699
you might be looking to go

1659
01:30:47,699 --> 01:30:50,159
short somewhere in here and then you

1660
01:30:50,159 --> 01:30:51,480
stop is ran

1661
01:30:51,480 --> 01:30:53,699
you may be looking to go long here and

1662
01:30:53,699 --> 01:30:56,040
then your stop gets Randy

1663
01:30:56,040 --> 01:30:57,719
you might be good looking to go short

1664
01:30:57,719 --> 01:31:00,600
here and then you stop your training

1665
01:31:00,600 --> 01:31:02,520
and this is just

1666
01:31:02,520 --> 01:31:06,239
multiple losses Within

1667
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:08,400
you know one session

1668
01:31:08,400 --> 01:31:11,520
we have that in New York where we

1669
01:31:11,520 --> 01:31:15,199
we see price take out a high

1670
01:31:15,540 --> 01:31:18,480
and then short back below

1671
01:31:18,480 --> 01:31:19,980
then

1672
01:31:19,980 --> 01:31:22,679
let me see

1673
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:24,780
you've been a little yeah no we didn't

1674
01:31:24,780 --> 01:31:26,639
but sometimes the spread takes people

1675
01:31:26,639 --> 01:31:28,679
out in this so

1676
01:31:28,679 --> 01:31:31,020
they're looking to go up and getting

1677
01:31:31,020 --> 01:31:33,120
along price

1678
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,679
comes back they're looking for the high

1679
01:31:34,679 --> 01:31:36,840
to get taken out they get stopped out at

1680
01:31:36,840 --> 01:31:38,100
break even because they're looking for

1681
01:31:38,100 --> 01:31:39,900
buy side or they're looking for the sell

1682
01:31:39,900 --> 01:31:42,420
side and and we're just in between the

1683
01:31:42,420 --> 01:31:44,659
range

1684
01:31:48,060 --> 01:31:49,800
and the mentorship I'll go over trading

1685
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,540
ranges and stuff like that too you know

1686
01:31:51,540 --> 01:31:53,580
but you you guys don't need that you

1687
01:31:53,580 --> 01:31:55,380
just you know you become a millionaire

1688
01:31:55,380 --> 01:31:57,659
of the playlist that's on YouTube

1689
01:31:57,659 --> 01:32:01,880
but you can find your Edge in the market

1690
01:32:02,159 --> 01:32:04,340
based on

1691
01:32:04,340 --> 01:32:08,179
understanding Market structure

1692
01:32:08,580 --> 01:32:10,560
if you use a five minute reviews in the

1693
01:32:10,560 --> 01:32:11,820
15 minute

1694
01:32:11,820 --> 01:32:13,739
you know because you can't reorder flow

1695
01:32:13,739 --> 01:32:16,020
yet order flows you you're only going to

1696
01:32:16,020 --> 01:32:17,400
be able to trade on one minute if you

1697
01:32:17,400 --> 01:32:18,360
know the order

1698
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,719
you need to understand order period

1699
01:32:21,719 --> 01:32:24,420
because we break highs we break lows we

1700
01:32:24,420 --> 01:32:26,280
break highs we break lows we break highs

1701
01:32:26,280 --> 01:32:27,840
we break lows we break highs we break

1702
01:32:27,840 --> 01:32:29,340
ones we talk about Market structure

1703
01:32:29,340 --> 01:32:30,360
shifting

1704
01:32:30,360 --> 01:32:32,340
how we can get a shift in Market

1705
01:32:32,340 --> 01:32:35,100
structure and you can still see price

1706
01:32:35,100 --> 01:32:37,139
continue back up again

1707
01:32:37,139 --> 01:32:40,980
that happened uh

1708
01:32:40,980 --> 01:32:43,440
is it Wednesday

1709
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:44,940
no Friday

1710
01:32:44,940 --> 01:32:47,400
that happened here

1711
01:32:47,400 --> 01:32:49,920
we

1712
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,260
we took out this low here

1713
01:32:52,260 --> 01:32:54,300
that put in this High here we took out

1714
01:32:54,300 --> 01:32:55,679
the low everybody

1715
01:32:55,679 --> 01:32:57,900
's coming back in everybody want to jump

1716
01:32:57,900 --> 01:33:00,239
short or you know somebody might have

1717
01:33:00,239 --> 01:33:01,760
got caught in here

1718
01:33:01,760 --> 01:33:04,560
the news but yeah somebody might have

1719
01:33:04,560 --> 01:33:07,020
got caught here

1720
01:33:07,020 --> 01:33:09,360
and then short shifted to break even and

1721
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:10,860
they're like oh yeah we're coming down

1722
01:33:10,860 --> 01:33:14,300
and then price takes them out

1723
01:33:16,199 --> 01:33:18,000
and then they changed their bias and

1724
01:33:18,000 --> 01:33:19,560
they expecting price to go up and price

1725
01:33:19,560 --> 01:33:21,239
go up and then they take the down take

1726
01:33:21,239 --> 01:33:22,860
them down there

1727
01:33:22,860 --> 01:33:26,840
and then they see this shift right here

1728
01:33:27,360 --> 01:33:29,219
you see this

1729
01:33:29,219 --> 01:33:31,440
High you see this low you see this high

1730
01:33:31,440 --> 01:33:32,340
again

1731
01:33:32,340 --> 01:33:34,800
you violate the low you wait for it to

1732
01:33:34,800 --> 01:33:36,480
come back up and then it violates the

1733
01:33:36,480 --> 01:33:38,659
high

1734
01:33:41,340 --> 01:33:43,500
and it's because understanding order

1735
01:33:43,500 --> 01:33:45,179
flow

1736
01:33:45,179 --> 01:33:47,340
when we get near major High

1737
01:33:47,340 --> 01:33:50,120
this is

1738
01:33:58,739 --> 01:34:01,219
make sure I quote this correct this is

1739
01:34:01,219 --> 01:34:04,440
the hourly High

1740
01:34:04,440 --> 01:34:06,960
when you get near it or 15 minute High

1741
01:34:06,960 --> 01:34:09,179
even we get near it we trade away from

1742
01:34:09,179 --> 01:34:11,280
it

1743
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:13,320
and what we spoke about

1744
01:34:13,320 --> 01:34:16,679
how price can take out these lows and

1745
01:34:16,679 --> 01:34:19,560
still trade higher earlier in the video

1746
01:34:19,560 --> 01:34:23,460
this is how it looks on candlesticks

1747
01:34:23,460 --> 01:34:25,620
took out these lows here

1748
01:34:25,620 --> 01:34:27,600
everybody's expecting us to come back in

1749
01:34:27,600 --> 01:34:31,940
in short and then what do we do belong

1750
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:35,520
Market opens up is Market open yeah

1751
01:34:35,520 --> 01:34:39,620
Market opens up and takes us time

1752
01:34:39,960 --> 01:34:43,940
even with news it's not good

1753
01:34:46,380 --> 01:34:49,560
Market opens up it takes us higher

1754
01:34:49,560 --> 01:34:51,780
because order flow is needed to be

1755
01:34:51,780 --> 01:34:54,840
successful on the one minute time frame

1756
01:34:54,840 --> 01:34:56,880
but then Market structure is needed

1757
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:59,639
first

1758
01:34:59,639 --> 01:35:01,580
you know be sure that we're

1759
01:35:01,580 --> 01:35:07,080
profitable with Market structure alone

1760
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,659
and then move into workflow

1761
01:35:09,659 --> 01:35:11,159
and we need to understand that but we're

1762
01:35:11,159 --> 01:35:14,840
under one minute if we're scalping

1763
01:35:15,000 --> 01:35:17,040
if you didn't find that from a higher

1764
01:35:17,040 --> 01:35:18,900
time frame Zone there's no reason why

1765
01:35:18,900 --> 01:35:20,340
you're holding to buy side you're

1766
01:35:20,340 --> 01:35:23,179
holding to sell side

1767
01:35:24,840 --> 01:35:27,719
you holding to to run the hourly High

1768
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:31,699
you holding to run the hourly low

1769
01:35:36,060 --> 01:35:38,820
so one minute if you're trading under

1770
01:35:38,820 --> 01:35:40,800
one minute

1771
01:35:40,800 --> 01:35:43,080
treat those entries as one minute

1772
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:45,600
entries

1773
01:35:45,600 --> 01:35:48,060
based on one minute

1774
01:35:48,060 --> 01:35:50,940
order flow which can be created and

1775
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:52,500
broken created and broken created and

1776
01:35:52,500 --> 01:35:54,060
broken created and broken that's all in

1777
01:35:54,060 --> 01:35:54,840
the playlist I'm not going to

1778
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:55,980
regurgitate I'm not going to be

1779
01:35:55,980 --> 01:35:57,719
redundant

1780
01:35:57,719 --> 01:36:01,520
but it's important to

1781
01:36:01,620 --> 01:36:04,199
you know

1782
01:36:04,199 --> 01:36:05,760
expect that

1783
01:36:05,760 --> 01:36:08,520
it's important to to

1784
01:36:08,520 --> 01:36:10,440
trade based on that y'all got some of

1785
01:36:10,440 --> 01:36:12,120
these ftml accounts they got you know

1786
01:36:12,120 --> 01:36:13,440
all these different platforms they're

1787
01:36:13,440 --> 01:36:14,880
using

1788
01:36:14,880 --> 01:36:16,020
and

1789
01:36:16,020 --> 01:36:17,580
y'all are hitting y'all living so

1790
01:36:17,580 --> 01:36:20,280
holding entries holding a one minute

1791
01:36:20,280 --> 01:36:22,800
entry that goes all the way up

1792
01:36:22,800 --> 01:36:24,300
and it comes all the way back down to

1793
01:36:24,300 --> 01:36:27,139
you you break even

1794
01:36:27,600 --> 01:36:30,480
so not only did you miss out on all of

1795
01:36:30,480 --> 01:36:32,280
that profit now you put yourself in all

1796
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:33,719
of that drawdown even though you lost

1797
01:36:33,719 --> 01:36:36,020
nothing

1798
01:36:38,639 --> 01:36:43,040
because the the trailing drawing

1799
01:36:46,020 --> 01:36:48,120
and you'll see that that'll make you

1800
01:36:48,120 --> 01:36:52,159
a lot more efficient as a Trader

1801
01:36:52,440 --> 01:36:54,000
trading within the respective Market

1802
01:36:54,000 --> 01:36:56,400
structure

1803
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,080
along with the other stuff that I teach

1804
01:36:58,080 --> 01:37:00,120
in the playlist is very very important

1805
01:37:00,120 --> 01:37:01,380
because the stuff that I teach in the

1806
01:37:01,380 --> 01:37:03,060
player supplies on all time frames not

1807
01:37:03,060 --> 01:37:06,320
just not just the one minute

1808
01:37:06,540 --> 01:37:09,000
it applies on all time frames but this

1809
01:37:09,000 --> 01:37:10,380
is just something that I want you guys

1810
01:37:10,380 --> 01:37:14,040
to understand that the the higher time

1811
01:37:14,040 --> 01:37:15,300
frame

1812
01:37:15,300 --> 01:37:17,460
Market structure

1813
01:37:17,460 --> 01:37:19,920
is King

1814
01:37:19,920 --> 01:37:23,100
queen or whatever you want to call it

1815
01:37:23,100 --> 01:37:28,280
it's what you should stick within

1816
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,679
and then adopt rules to it

1817
01:37:34,679 --> 01:37:37,199
you're expecting to hold the zones

1818
01:37:37,199 --> 01:37:40,020
you're choosing are not from the one

1819
01:37:40,020 --> 01:37:43,139
minute the zones you are choosing are

1820
01:37:43,139 --> 01:37:44,940
from the higher time frame and if you're

1821
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:47,280
taking a higher time frame Zone you're

1822
01:37:47,280 --> 01:37:51,199
taking a higher time frame Zone

1823
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:53,820
right

1824
01:37:53,820 --> 01:37:56,300
that's within that higher time frame

1825
01:37:56,300 --> 01:38:00,199
Market structure

1826
01:38:05,040 --> 01:38:06,600
within the higher time frame Market

1827
01:38:06,600 --> 01:38:09,199
structure

1828
01:38:10,440 --> 01:38:13,440
the one minute time frame respects

1829
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:17,400
higher time frame Market structure

1830
01:38:17,400 --> 01:38:21,380
the higher time frame Market structure

1831
01:38:21,380 --> 01:38:25,280
disrespects the one minute

1832
01:38:25,739 --> 01:38:27,420
Market structure whatever you want to

1833
01:38:27,420 --> 01:38:29,719
call it

1834
01:38:30,600 --> 01:38:34,280
you'll probably respect you stop

1835
01:38:35,940 --> 01:38:37,560
make sure your entries you're holding

1836
01:38:37,560 --> 01:38:40,760
this from the higher time frame

1837
01:38:43,920 --> 01:38:46,639
so

1838
01:38:46,739 --> 01:38:50,120
I feel like that was a good um

1839
01:38:50,280 --> 01:38:53,360
you know uh

1840
01:38:53,699 --> 01:38:57,440
reminder at least

1841
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:02,100
good reminder for a lot of people to um

1842
01:39:02,100 --> 01:39:05,520
you know just I I teach in the course

1843
01:39:05,520 --> 01:39:08,340
top-down analysis there's a video four I

1844
01:39:08,340 --> 01:39:10,080
think it is

1845
01:39:10,080 --> 01:39:13,199
I teach Market structure from a higher

1846
01:39:13,199 --> 01:39:14,880
time frame to lower time frame lower

1847
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:16,440
time frame higher time from teach that

1848
01:39:16,440 --> 01:39:19,800
in the course as well

1849
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:21,900
but these are just some things that I

1850
01:39:21,900 --> 01:39:24,420
want you guys to

1851
01:39:24,420 --> 01:39:27,840
you know keep with you as as a as a key

1852
01:39:27,840 --> 01:39:28,980
to

1853
01:39:28,980 --> 01:39:31,560
or a key Point Within

1854
01:39:31,560 --> 01:39:34,440
trading intraday

1855
01:39:34,440 --> 01:39:38,420
what is the market structure

1856
01:39:39,000 --> 01:39:41,760
for

1857
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:43,860
the higher time frame before I enter

1858
01:39:43,860 --> 01:39:46,500
into any trades I don't need to enter

1859
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:48,300
into

1860
01:39:48,300 --> 01:39:52,080
lungs because the

1861
01:39:52,080 --> 01:39:54,179
the market structures loan I can enter

1862
01:39:54,179 --> 01:39:56,040
shorts as well

1863
01:39:56,040 --> 01:39:58,260
but it'll help me to understand how long

1864
01:39:58,260 --> 01:40:02,400
I'm holding my shorts for would help me

1865
01:40:02,400 --> 01:40:04,980
to understand how long I'm holding my

1866
01:40:04,980 --> 01:40:08,179
Longs forward

1867
01:40:09,179 --> 01:40:11,040
when you feel a lot more comfortable in

1868
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:12,659
your trades

1869
01:40:12,659 --> 01:40:14,580
the same thing I did with the woman the

1870
01:40:14,580 --> 01:40:16,440
the the one hour you could do it with a

1871
01:40:16,440 --> 01:40:18,600
15 minute too

1872
01:40:18,600 --> 01:40:20,400
it'd probably be better to do it with a

1873
01:40:20,400 --> 01:40:22,920
one hour but you could do it with a 15

1874
01:40:22,920 --> 01:40:25,500
minute as well

1875
01:40:25,500 --> 01:40:27,239
you use the market structure from the 15

1876
01:40:27,239 --> 01:40:29,340
minute but just understand that higher

1877
01:40:29,340 --> 01:40:31,620
time frame Market structure

1878
01:40:31,620 --> 01:40:36,060
is okay now this is a very basic video a

1879
01:40:36,060 --> 01:40:38,580
very you know

1880
01:40:38,580 --> 01:40:43,260
beginner you know foundational video

1881
01:40:43,260 --> 01:40:46,440
and there are a lot more details to

1882
01:40:46,440 --> 01:40:48,780
cover about how

1883
01:40:48,780 --> 01:40:50,820
order flow

1884
01:40:50,820 --> 01:40:52,139
um

1885
01:40:52,139 --> 01:40:55,620
you know can even be followed

1886
01:40:55,620 --> 01:40:58,020
the basics of that I teach and the free

1887
01:40:58,020 --> 01:40:59,460
playlist

1888
01:40:59,460 --> 01:41:02,699
and the rest of that that's in my

1889
01:41:02,699 --> 01:41:05,040
mentorship so if you are new here if you

01:41:05,040 --> 01:41:06,600
don't know me if I you know I don't know

1891

you

1892
01:41:07,860 --> 01:41:11,280
you want to make sure you know that

1893
01:41:11,280 --> 01:41:14,400
you don't need

1894
01:41:14,400 --> 01:41:18,000

mentorship

1899
01:41:23,340 --> 01:41:25,199
