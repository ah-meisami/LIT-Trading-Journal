1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,120
okay

2
00:00:02,120 --> 00:00:05,879
so here we go um you guys can hear me

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,440
right right good good

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,320
um so yeah I I asked you guys about this

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:14,719
Zone it was clear as day you know like

6
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:17,480
it was I expect most of you guys to get

7
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,000
it that right

8
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:24,359
there that right there remember what I

9
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:26,519
said about your zones too I said make

10
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:28,519
sure something is taken before price

11
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:30,920
manipulates into your Zone

12
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:34,360
so that's the thing that's taken

13
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,520
there

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:41,239
um but um on to what I called this uh so

15
00:00:41,239 --> 00:00:44,120
so sandep what's up how you doing um you

16
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:48,640
know one thing I do appreciate about

17
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,280
um you know a lot of the uh uh students

18
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:54,840
here especially the younger students um

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:56,559
and that's nothing you know do with the

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:59,920
gas I'm Giza myself you know but um with

21
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,320
the younger students they they tend to

22
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:02,800
be

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,040
um um very transparent about their

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,759
process the emotions that they feel and

25
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:14,200
and how hard they're they take

26
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,799
on um losses and a lot of the times um

27
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,680
the lessons that that come through those

28
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:25,960
emotional

29
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:30,960
losses are the ones that are uh

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,280
lasting so um you know let me say this

31
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,680
directly to uh uh send deep and anybody

32
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,520
else that that happens to be in that

33
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,079
position um you know there there's you a

34
00:01:43,079 --> 00:01:46,119
couple of students who have uh found

35
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:49,600
their found themselves um you know sort

36
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:52,719
of in that position where uh they're

37
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:55,200
doing everything they

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,960
can to

39
00:01:57,960 --> 00:01:59,960
to understand this they're putting in

40
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:03,079
the hours they're they're uh uh you know

41
00:02:03,079 --> 00:02:06,079
writing every single word that's spoken

42
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:08,280
they're going back over everything to

43
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,519
look at everything that's that's uh

44
00:02:13,519 --> 00:02:16,440
um uh uh how do I say it every

45
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,000
everything that's

46
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,840
that's a part of a trade plan that's

47
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:23,480
concrete they're adding that into their

48
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,760
approach in the market yet there seems

49
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,519
to be

50
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:30,360
no uh breakthrough

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:35,680
or if there is it seems just like

52
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:40,440
this it seems like you get that that

53
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,280
high oh man DT FX it it his

54
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,080
Concepts crazy like have you have you

55
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,760
guys you know uh seen it soon soon as we

56
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,599
drop up you right in the zone you get in

57
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,159
the zone and and Bam it goes right out

58
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,720
perfect perfect right that's how some of

59
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:04,159
us are we we tapped into ch's anonymous

60
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,040
we tapped into

61
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,879
dtfs we tapped into the the uh uh stuff

62
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,440
that was there obviously we joined the

63
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:14,360
mentorship you know um took steps to

64
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,400
progress ourselves

65
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,159
but

66
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,440
this right here this extension

67
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:25,360
here this

68
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:28,680
extension moving its way up like

69
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,360
that

70
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:33,760
in in a a

71
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,319
market that is

72
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:40,840
healthy the market that's

73
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,040
healthy you're going to

74
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,159
have pullbacks

75
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:55,519
right sometimes it's deeper mitigations

76
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,680
than we anticipate

77
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,480
it but that deeper mitigation just

78
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:04,000
brings us back

79
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,239
to the foundation

80
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:10,439
right when when we

81
00:04:10,439 --> 00:04:15,199
get when we get a a a boost off

82
00:04:15,199 --> 00:04:18,560
of the original knowledge we took in to

83
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,759
help us to to break

84
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:25,240
through that little range that

85
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:27,199
our

86
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:30,240
um uh trading has had us in

87
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,880
for some

88
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:35,639
time we get that rush but then we often

89
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:40,320
head right back to where that Rush began

90
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,440
so you have a lot of people now who are

91
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:44,800
on the second

92
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:48,160
layer who are like okay I understand

93
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,800
swings I understand

94
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,800
fractals I understand to wait until

95
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:56,600
price takes something I understand like

96
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:59,080
there there's all of these these

97
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,479
different things that that

98
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:05,199
um you know they they kind of have

99
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:09,160
grasped to the point where they're here

100
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:12,680
right here this is this is back into the

101
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:15,759
P of their growth back into the P of

102
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,240
their development back into the P of of

103
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,039
where they

104
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:26,039
originally found some progress right

105
00:05:26,039 --> 00:05:28,600
right but one thing I often tell the

106
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:31,160
students is that

107
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,560
even

108
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,360
though you begin to get to a place where

109
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:40,800
you find more progress what you need to

110
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,280
understand is that

111
00:05:44,280 --> 00:05:49,440
you are not Incorporated in all of this

112
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,520
you and and what is

113
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:56,520
you you is a

114
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:58,479
refined

115
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,600
system that throughout all the feelings

116
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,160
and emotions within this this cycle if

117
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:07,080
you want to

118
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:10,400
take you're trading to another

119
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:15,319
level if you want to take it

120
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:20,039
higher then there are some lows that

121
00:06:20,039 --> 00:06:23,160
that that's going to be

122
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,120
ran it's going to look like

123
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,120
this because guess what Within

124
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:33,000
this within the foundation of everything

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,160
that's

126
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,120
here we realize

127
00:06:38,840 --> 00:06:42,880
that we only know a very small amount

128
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:45,639
we've only spent a very short amount of

129
00:06:45,639 --> 00:06:47,479
time doing

130
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:50,160
this and what we don't

131
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:53,919
know or or what we don't

132
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,520
remember is that the

133
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,160
blueprint is

134
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:04,280
higher highs higher lows right higher

135
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,599
highs higher lows right but what we're

136
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,720
not often paying attention to within

137
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:12,240
this move

138
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,400
down into US trading

139
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:18,919
higher is that this little move inside

140
00:07:18,919 --> 00:07:20,080
of

141
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:24,160
here was not a part of

142
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,479
structure it was just the

143
00:07:27,479 --> 00:07:31,319
introduction to let you know

144
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:34,680
know that we'd be

145
00:07:34,680 --> 00:07:37,560
reaching to that side of the market

146
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,960
whatever is back here whatever is back

147
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,759
there so you need to understand

148
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,879
that even as you make this

149
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:51,800
push and an advancement in your trading

150
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:56,360
you're going to have some lows that go

151
00:07:56,360 --> 00:07:59,159
below where you even started how you

152
00:07:59,159 --> 00:08:02,639
even even began to to you know um

153
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:04,440
process this all the different ways that

154
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:06,560
you felt about yourself that means you

155
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,520
are running this is where you started

156
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,919
remember Charter Anonymous is is this

157
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:11,759
this

158
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:14,199
large let me just you know change the

159
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,440
color for Optics Char Anonymous is this

160
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,879
large box here you scratched the surface

161
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,039
and that catapulted you so what does

162
00:08:24,039 --> 00:08:29,479
that mean about this Zone this community

163
00:08:29,479 --> 00:08:32,799
the the teachings that are that are

164
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:36,880
placed within the depths within the

165
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:39,760
depths of the material that's there the

166
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:43,120
the the stuff that's there that that you

167
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:45,240
know if if you can remember every word

168
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:47,600
and friends in the office you put that

169
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,560
energy there put that energy into the

170
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:53,760
the deepest parts of it the things

171
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,200
people don't go back and watch go to the

172
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,360
videos that have the the lowest amount

173
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:00,079
of views on it

174
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:03,680
and be like oh my gosh this

175
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:08,040
is this the treasure is really Beneath

176
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:11,440
the Sea it's it's

177
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,120
beneath our plans our plans was

178
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:19,800
what our plans was to come into Char is

179
00:09:19,800 --> 00:09:21,880
anonymous right because I know I know

180
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:24,720
some some of y'all you know uh uh had

181
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:27,600
had those plans as well our plans were

182
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:30,360
to come into chars anonymous

183
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:32,720
spend a month and then become a

184
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,720
millionaire the next

185
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,760
month but some of us had to find out

186
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:45,000
that our plans was not a part of

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:49,600
structure so we were able to go back

188
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:52,640
into not not the origin of your move the

189
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,640
origin of

190
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:57,680
mine the origin of the playlist the

191
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,120
origin of the basics the principles the

192
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:02,560
you know it's it's all

193
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,079
here and

194
00:10:05,079 --> 00:10:08,519
that's where that ENT that the Ascension

195
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:10,640
occurs

196
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,880
that's where you begin to actually

197
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,160
create

198
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:18,959
structure that that ran your prior

199
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,600
thinking that prior low that was in your

200
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,120
mind that that prior you know uh uh

201
00:10:26,120 --> 00:10:29,560
idea that you know sure enough

202
00:10:29,560 --> 00:10:32,959
within one month's time you are going to

203
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:35,800
take this you you know blow the roof off

204
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:40,040
yes you can you can but guess what every

205
00:10:40,040 --> 00:10:42,600
Trader no matter how much you remember

206
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:45,120
the things that Dave

207
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:48,560
teaches has taught in in in any of the

208
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:50,200
forums that I've taught

209
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,320
on every

210
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:55,880
Trader will have to run their own

211
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:58,320
low we have to run the low of their

212
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:00,519
expectations

213
00:11:00,519 --> 00:11:02,680
we have to and and unreasonable

214
00:11:02,680 --> 00:11:06,000
expectations at that we'll have to run

215
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,680
the lad of of holding on to what it is

216
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:12,880
that they had in

217
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,600
mind and stick

218
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,519
to the foundation of

219
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:22,480
it stick to what's what's been given

220
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,040
remember everything that you need is

221
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,000
here but for some people the surface is

222
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:34,279
what they're looking to you know uh uh

223
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,760
take and and and go to the next level

224
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,519
and and do whatever it is they're doing

225
00:11:38,519 --> 00:11:40,120
it's the surface that they're paying

226
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:43,320
attention to but they don't know first

227
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:46,760
to break structure to the top side

228
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:49,519
right that's thing they not considering

229
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,360
this what what video was that y'all come

230
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:55,240
on y'all know first

231
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:01,440
to first tap breaks structure to the top

232
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,600
side and when the second tap comes

233
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:07,959
in often times with the second

234
00:12:07,959 --> 00:12:10,760
top you get a run of the low that

235
00:12:10,760 --> 00:12:12,720
provided the first

236
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:17,320
to and we begin to now

237
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,279
accumulate to

238
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,920
leave and take out the high that brought

239
00:12:22,920 --> 00:12:28,440
this low to us right so our development

240
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:32,160
at tra as Traders it's the same exact

241
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:36,079
way but we need to understand that

242
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:42,959
that we've we've uh uh We've tapped the

243
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:46,480
surface of what we know but there's a

244
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:49,519
lot deeper we can go that can catapult

245
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:53,320
us to a higher

246
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:57,160
place and and some of you guys are are

247
00:12:57,160 --> 00:12:59,120
in this you know some of you guys there

248
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,160
somewhere within this Dynamic whether

249
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:03,720
it's the person first joining whether

250
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:05,720
it's the person you know just watching

251
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:07,480
the playlist whether it's the person

252
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:10,000
that's down in the dumps over here and

253
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,160
feel like you know they just want to

254
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:14,399
break structure and and and go to the

255
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,240
downside and just short the rest of

256
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:19,240
their career as a Trader that's not you

257
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,760
you are not that

258
00:13:20,760 --> 00:13:24,600
person you are hungry you are willing to

259
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
do what it takes you are willing to sit

260
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:30,040
down and not get up until things change

261
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,440
but you have to also be willing to be

262
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:35,079
broken that's what the market does to

263
00:13:35,079 --> 00:13:38,680
people it breaks you the more detail you

264
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,279
notice the harder it is to to make

265
00:13:42,279 --> 00:13:45,199
certain decisions but guess what those

266
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:47,880
decisions become a lot easier because

267
00:13:47,880 --> 00:13:50,920
now that you have that detail you're

268
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:54,720
going to know within that detail what's

269
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,880
highly probable and what's

270
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:59,959
not and now you can choose you don't

271
00:13:59,959 --> 00:14:02,240
even have to be a part of everything oh

272
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:03,959
give me something give me something give

273
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:05,399
me something give me something that that

274
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,399
sounds like a

275
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:09,600
gambler but for the person that knows

276
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,320
when to step

277
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,920
in that

278
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:19,199
detail that you're

279
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:21,680
learning there comes a time where you

280
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,639
become confused because you see all of

281
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:29,440
it and you do not know where to start

282
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,320
start you have no idea where to begin

283
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:35,120
because that looks like that but it also

284
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:36,519
looks like that but it also looks like

285
00:14:36,519 --> 00:14:37,800
that but it also looks like that but it

286
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:39,079
also looks like that but it also looks

287
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:40,279
like that but it also looks like that

288
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:42,639
but it also looks like that and if you

289
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:44,480
go back into back

290
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:48,399
testing you'll see that all of it looks

291
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,079
like that where are you in this in this

292
00:14:55,079 --> 00:14:57,160
equation where are

293
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:00,959
you where do you know the move comes out

294
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:03,320
of whatever move it is if you want that

295
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,160
Mambo Jambo you know nice

296
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:10,079
looking if you want that large move just

297
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:11,880
just leave not that means you got to

298
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:15,160
leave alone all of the other stuff sit

299
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,639
it to the

300
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,320
side and just stick with that move that

301
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:23,120
you know is rooted in in the personality

302
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:26,360
that you have and and the

303
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,680
contentment for whatever it is could

304
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:32,079
could be given to you behind that zone

305
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:33,839
and that might mean going back to

306
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:35,680
incorporate higher time frame into lower

307
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,079
time frame just so you're on the right

308
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:38,160
side of the

309
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:41,680
market yes you don't have to go up but

310
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:44,079
it's important for you to go up if you

311
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,480
struggle with what's below let me show

312
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:50,399
you guys um uh there was this this Wick

313
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:54,399
that I set um an entry on last night I

314
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,000
think it was a 12 minute was it no it

315
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:59,319
wasn't 12

316
00:15:59,319 --> 00:16:04,959
minute uh let me see

317
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:11,199
15

318
00:16:12,120 --> 00:16:15,800
uh was it or was it the one hour no it

319
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:17,920
wasn't the 1 hour so it had to be the

320
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,319
15 so there there was a limit that I I

321
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:23,600
had

322
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:27,519
set on this right here

323
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:30,519
right

324
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,759
and I set the limit

325
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,319
there because it was a higher time frame

326
00:16:40,319 --> 00:16:44,199
Zone my understanding was that this low

327
00:16:44,199 --> 00:16:47,920
within here successfully took out this

328
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:52,000
High to the left body closure so this is

329
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,560
a sucessful low that's

330
00:16:55,560 --> 00:17:00,319
here so my limit was set here and guess

331
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,360
what I never got tapped

332
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:04,880
in never got tapped into this limit

333
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:07,599
because of the spread on cfds now my

334
00:17:07,599 --> 00:17:10,439
invalidation was behind here and I was

335
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:13,240
just looking to take profit right up

336
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,199
above the previous high that led me into

337
00:17:16,199 --> 00:17:17,959
the zone right

338
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:21,439
here and the spread did not take me

339
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:24,119
in but was that something that I was

340
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:26,880
like okay yeah now the the spread didn't

341
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:30,039
take me in so let me go and try to short

342
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:31,520
something real quick let me look for a

343
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,559
short in here maybe let me try to short

344
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:37,880
this right here then let me because we

345
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,760
we got to get back into even even over

346
00:17:40,760 --> 00:17:42,400
here look at this Zone

347
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,880
here you have this Zone within here was

348
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,000
the 50% tapped in

349
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:49,880
here let me just double check before I

350
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,919
give youall snake oil be like yeah you

351
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:54,280
see it wasn't tap and it was it

352
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:57,640
wasn't so when it's not making its way

353
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,320
back to

354
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:00,559
what you

355
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,120
anticipated how do you engage with

356
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:08,600
price how do you follow what it is

357
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:11,200
that's occurring now if we were just to

358
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,000
remove this obviously we see no lows

359
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,480
taken right this is this stairway up

360
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,400
this is trend line whatever you want to

361
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:22,480
call it so you know that this side of

362
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:26,039
the market you are on but this is after

363
00:18:26,039 --> 00:18:30,120
a flip that occurred on the 15

364
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:33,480
minute so some people what they're doing

365
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:36,440
is and and let me let me show you guys

366
00:18:36,440 --> 00:18:38,480
cuz this was me I listen that that's why

367
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:39,760
I say it's important mentorship is

368
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:41,520
important mentorship is important

369
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:44,360
because you guys have to know that

370
00:18:44,360 --> 00:18:46,000
within that same system that you're

371
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,159
using here are here are things that's

372
00:18:48,159 --> 00:18:53,360
going to trip you up so so it's it's as

373
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,320
simple as

374
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,960
remembering where you are within your

375
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:02,240
range right so we know this is the

376
00:19:02,240 --> 00:19:04,080
bottom of the range we know that this is

377
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,159
more or less the top of the range up

378
00:19:06,159 --> 00:19:11,919
here most of the rejections came out of

379
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:16,799
here these three or four up here within

380
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:19,840
this low down below and this high up

381
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,640
above to the left multiple rejections

382
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:26,520
are happening in here but

383
00:19:26,760 --> 00:19:31,120
this is particularly this Zone here

384
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:34,679
right so when a lot of us see this break

385
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:35,600
up

386
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:38,000
above we

387
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,559
immediately want to begin getting

388
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:42,480
involved in something that's going to go

389
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:44,640
higher and especially on the 5sec that

390
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,600
could suck you in and trip you up if you

391
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,440
do not leave the one minute as your

392
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:53,000
master time frame and follow the one

393
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,120
minute as your master time frame so

394
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,720
here's what ends up happening now we

395
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:00,520
want to engage in a a market that we see

396
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:03,159
is trending higher and we want higher

397
00:20:03,159 --> 00:20:06,480
prices but what we don't understand or

398
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,039
what we're not really using at the

399
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:13,480
Forefront of our our uh understanding is

400
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,760
that we do not have enough money to push

401
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:20,720
price higher in the event that we take

402
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:24,120
out a high to the left right they did

403
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:26,559
that not us not our money their money

404
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:29,919
was taking us that down right that we

405
00:20:29,919 --> 00:20:32,320
just we was just a part of it but that

406
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,880
money was taking us down and this is

407
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:38,520
where their money flipped right here

408
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:42,640
this area here so when they brought us

409
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:46,679
up above their High here to the left it

410
00:20:46,679 --> 00:20:49,520
would be nothing but

411
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,760
audacity for me to believe that I can

412
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,559
get price to go higher and now I'm in

413
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:58,520
that Blockbuster move going back to sell

414
00:20:58,520 --> 00:21:01,320
side and there's a lot of us that plan

415
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:03,320
for things like that rather than being

416
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:05,760
content with what's currently happening

417
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,720
here so what do we end up

418
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,720
seeing we end up seeing a couple

419
00:21:11,720 --> 00:21:13,760
rejections coming off that that area

420
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:16,039
below we get the confirmation and this

421
00:21:16,039 --> 00:21:18,200
is where people are getting in at this

422
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,440
confirmation to trade higher or people

423
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,960
are looking for a short to trade

424
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:31,320
lower and the greed steps in right

425
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:35,120
here the greed steps in this delivered

426
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:37,760
the high to the left but

427
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,039
then we saw an equal High which what

428
00:21:42,039 --> 00:21:43,919
takes out both

429
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:48,520
lows so here we are in our it's the snd

430
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:51,360
responsible for the break so yeah the

431
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:53,640
first tap to break a structure to the

432
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:56,400
top side the second top not even knowing

433
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,039
where we are

434
00:22:00,840 --> 00:22:02,559
not even knowing what occurred what

435
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,919
would where where we are in structure

436
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:07,559
these things happen to us and we get

437
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,559
lost and confused without just

438
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:14,799
remembering

439
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,320
right that when in doubt yes you must

440
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,480
stay out that entirely true but you also

441
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,679
should not be trading things that you do

442
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:27,159
not have experience for and I'm not

443
00:22:27,159 --> 00:22:29,000
talking to to deep in general I'm

444
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:30,679
talking to

445
00:22:30,679 --> 00:22:33,559
everybody taking trades on for for

446
00:22:33,559 --> 00:22:37,200
things you do not have experience with

447
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,640
you do not have experience with if

448
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,320
anybody had experience holding 100 200

449
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,159
300 Point moves guess what they wouldn't

450
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:47,480
be here right

451
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:50,360
now so for us to think or have the

452
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:52,919
audacity that we can get more when we

453
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:54,840
barely walk away from the market with

454
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:58,640
anything at all it's a heat check for us

455
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,600
is 10 enough or is it

456
00:23:01,600 --> 00:23:05,400
not and is that 10 aligned within your

457
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,240
your understanding of your ability to

458
00:23:07,240 --> 00:23:09,919
get 10 and back testing each time some

459
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:11,640
of you guys need to stop back testing on

460
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:14,200
the 5sec and back test on a one minute

461
00:23:14,200 --> 00:23:15,720
how are you going to be successful with

462
00:23:15,720 --> 00:23:17,400
the 5c if you don't even know what the

463
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:20,440
one minute is doing you just you

464
00:23:20,440 --> 00:23:23,080
pressing the button and hoping that it

465
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,279
just follows whatever you your think

466
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,679
analysis

467
00:23:26,679 --> 00:23:29,840
is cuz you didn't use technicals you I'm

468
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,799
I'm sure you didn't you thought about it

469
00:23:31,799 --> 00:23:35,480
and said oh price can go higher and the

470
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,440
minute you thought price could go higher

471
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,600
guess what right the other

472
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,919
way and then the minute you turn around

473
00:23:43,919 --> 00:23:46,600
and try to engage the other way right

474
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,919
the other

475
00:23:49,279 --> 00:23:52,039
way and then it's easy to see him back

476
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:55,799
testing and in back testing we go oh oh

477
00:23:55,799 --> 00:23:58,080
yeah you know that that's thing that Tri

478
00:23:58,080 --> 00:24:00,480
me up a lot you know cuz back testing is

479
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:03,400
looking like this for some people just

480
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:06,559
like this missing all the first of all

481
00:24:06,559 --> 00:24:08,440
do do you see how much detail is in this

482
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:11,919
bad boy much detail in this look look at

483
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:16,840
this equal did we say a run what oh you

484
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:19,480
you see

485
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:25,399
the so so um if it's and deep and and

486
00:24:25,399 --> 00:24:27,399
everybody else that's that's sort of out

487
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:30,799
there um you know who who feel stuck or

488
00:24:30,799 --> 00:24:32,919
or who you know continue

489
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:36,520
to um you know trade wait let me

490
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:39,720
actually just turn this

491
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:42,159
off wait don't tell me I lost everything

492
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:46,520
did I oh come

493
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,600
on come on I'm just

494
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:58,399
oh okay whatever um yeah so so we we

495
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:00,120
need to know that when we are back

496
00:25:00,120 --> 00:25:02,080
testing are we back testing to make

497
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:04,320
money are we back testing to learn what

498
00:25:04,320 --> 00:25:07,360
price is doing so we could see it ahead

499
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:10,000
of time and know how to engage with

500
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,440
price I'm not back testing to find Longs

501
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:15,880
I'm not back testing to find shorts I'm

502
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:19,360
not clicking through the bars to find

503
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:22,120
where I can get in on an entry the

504
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:24,080
reason why I started back testing to

505
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,039
begin with the reason why I started back

506
00:25:27,039 --> 00:25:29,679
testing to be

507
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:32,960
with is because I wanted to know how

508
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,720
this

509
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:38,240
moved not to to actually like push the

510
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:40,679
button and and oh yeah right there I was

511
00:25:40,679 --> 00:25:43,399
I was right on that that zone yeah cuz

512
00:25:43,399 --> 00:25:45,120
we we write on the Zone today and then

513
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:46,640
we take the same Zone tomorrow and we

514
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,960
get clapped on

515
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:50,760
it and then we take three more zones the

516
00:25:50,760 --> 00:25:53,320
same day that look like today's Zone and

517
00:25:53,320 --> 00:25:56,760
we have confidence in today's Zone but

518
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,000
now is a new day

519
00:25:59,000 --> 00:26:01,760
and we get clapped 20 ways from Sunday

520
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,919
on that

521
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:09,039
day because we're we're carrying over

522
00:26:09,039 --> 00:26:10,640
what what it is we're doing in back

523
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,279
testing to try and materialize it to

524
00:26:13,279 --> 00:26:16,520
money quick but we should want to

525
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,520
materialize the things we learn in back

526
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,799
testing

527
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:25,600
to understanding quick to applying it on

528
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,440
the charts quick not

529
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,399
to make the money quick because guess

530
00:26:30,399 --> 00:26:33,080
what you can put 20

531
00:26:33,080 --> 00:26:35,960
contracts on on a short you could even

532
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:38,480
get access to a 100 contracts and throw

533
00:26:38,480 --> 00:26:39,640
it on a

534
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:43,799
short and flip a coin and be

535
00:26:43,799 --> 00:26:47,399
right so it's it's

536
00:26:47,399 --> 00:26:53,760
not about back testing to be right back

537
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,399
testing to put a a a monetary amount

538
00:26:58,399 --> 00:27:02,000
behind it it's back testing your

539
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,600
understanding of what price does versus

540
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:07,200
what it does not do and guess what all

541
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:10,640
you're doing is exploiting where to get

542
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:13,720
in that's it you're exploiting that

543
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:17,679
little subtle change there and you're

544
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:19,840
and now you're learning where to get in

545
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:21,640
now you're learning how to operate now

546
00:27:21,640 --> 00:27:23,360
you're like there's a ton of stuff

547
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:25,399
that's within that I tell people no zone

548
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:28,000
no trade but you know a lot of the the

549
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:30,760
the students in premium see that some of

550
00:27:30,760 --> 00:27:33,080
the zones that I take it's not

551
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:35,919
traditional zones it's sometimes the

552
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:39,080
entry is not a a traditional entry but

553
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:41,279
it's because you fully understand what

554
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:43,080
Market structure is doing or or where

555
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:44,480
order flow is going or what we're

556
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,399
reaching into or what part of order flow

557
00:27:46,399 --> 00:27:48,880
you're in I always say that right so

558
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:50,480
that means that if you're in a certain

559
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,960
part of order flow that takes price

560
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:55,600
higher and we come back and run a

561
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:58,919
low and we tap into is something that we

562
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,720
understand this is how the market works

563
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:03,159
and this is how to clean people out and

564
00:28:03,159 --> 00:28:05,320
then they begin to trade higher from

565
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:08,039
here we don't necessarily need to be

566
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:11,519
present for that top if we understand

567
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:15,039
that this is the way it works now it's

568
00:28:15,039 --> 00:28:17,240
done with this side and it's heading to

569
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:19,360
that side and this is the lowest part

570
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:21,120
that I'm

571
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:24,840
in on on the side that's getting ready

572
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:27,480
to to be attacked I'm in the lowest

573
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:30,000
portion of that entry back testing will

574
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,440
teach you

575
00:28:32,440 --> 00:28:35,200
that but to back test and say hey so I

576
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:39,159
back tested and I I I calculated that

577
00:28:39,159 --> 00:28:42,240
within 10 points and if I at least give

578
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:45,440
myself a considerable stop of maybe 11

579
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:48,760
points I can be risking X Y and Z and

580
00:28:48,760 --> 00:28:50,799
then if I Target a one to one then with

581
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:52,679
the one: one I'm able to and you're

582
00:28:52,679 --> 00:28:55,080
building up all of this stuff in your

583
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:58,000
brain about what your entry is supposed

584
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:00,760
to do for you you're fixing yourself in

585
00:29:00,760 --> 00:29:03,919
that in that position of what price is

586
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:05,720
doing and

587
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:08,960
then we get

588
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,720
clapped

589
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:14,559
because our rules or at least the things

590
00:29:14,559 --> 00:29:15,960
that we

591
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:19,000
expect it's not defined in the

592
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,159
candlesticks why do you guys think I

593
00:29:21,159 --> 00:29:24,480
said no zone no trade to begin with and

594
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:26,840
then I said take 10 and get out take

595
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,399
five take 10 and get

596
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,399
out what do you guys think I said that I

597
00:29:30,399 --> 00:29:31,799
didn't say that because you guys can't

598
00:29:31,799 --> 00:29:36,320
catch more than 10 but the greed in you

599
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:39,640
will always try to get

600
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:42,039
more rather

601
00:29:42,039 --> 00:29:45,200
than understanding where your level of

602
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:47,799
experience is and trading relative to

603
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:50,960
that if you don't come in throwing 50

604
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:53,960
100 Point bangers every day on on some

605
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:56,559
of these pirs you should not be looking

606
00:29:56,559 --> 00:29:59,320
for it

607
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:01,960
if you've lost more

608
00:30:01,960 --> 00:30:04,519
money in the market than you've taken

609
00:30:04,519 --> 00:30:09,320
out you should not be looking for

610
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:11,960
it because you need to understand that

611
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:15,720
that when you fully grasp this

612
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,799
compounding will be so much more

613
00:30:18,799 --> 00:30:21,360
powerful than your high and low being

614
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,519
taken out you oh yeah I want to go for S

615
00:30:23,519 --> 00:30:25,320
sign oh yeah yeah it's going to go to

616
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,840
buy side you know like we have have all

617
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,640
of these

618
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:32,480
ideas that we want to see

619
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:35,200
materialized and our experience doesn't

620
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,240
even support

621
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:41,760
it our experience doesn't even support

622
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:44,559
it when I built my computer there was a

623
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:47,159
ton of drives I had to download that did

624
00:30:47,159 --> 00:30:48,640
not come

625
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,480
pre-installed there were things I had to

626
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,320
download just to make certain components

627
00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:54,760
of it

628
00:30:55,279 --> 00:30:58,840
work so the product was put together and

629
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:02,320
and ready to turn

630
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,760
on but that doesn't mean that everything

631
00:31:05,760 --> 00:31:09,240
was in its its uh Data Bank its memory

632
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:13,720
bank to be able to operate at Full

633
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:15,960
Throttle

634
00:31:15,960 --> 00:31:18,559
right needed to be some things cleaned

635
00:31:18,559 --> 00:31:20,480
out blo

636
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,200
wear blo wear

637
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,880
is I tell you how to beat the market I

638
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,279
tell you

639
00:31:28,279 --> 00:31:33,120
if you in if you invest if you

640
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:37,639
invest in an in an SB Index Fund you're

641
00:31:37,639 --> 00:31:40,200
going to beat the market every time

642
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:42,639
that's

643
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:45,519
that's blow

644
00:31:45,519 --> 00:31:49,120
wear trading in the zone with Mark

645
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:52,840
Douglas blow wear all of these things

646
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:56,240
are blo wear because they do not

647
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:57,840
actually

648
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:02,919
help you to perform the task at

649
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:07,399
hand do not actually help you with

650
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:11,799
that so some of us need a hard reset

651
00:32:11,799 --> 00:32:14,919
like I'm talking about you know reset

652
00:32:14,919 --> 00:32:19,000
everything from from from

653
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:22,279
from the

654
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:26,080
basics from the

655
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:29,080
basics

656
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:34,440
back to the

657
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:45,200
basics some of us

658
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:57,080
joined some of us joined after running a

659
00:32:57,080 --> 00:32:59,880
low in our

660
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:02,679
lives some of us joined after running Al

661
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,760
low in our career running Al low in we

662
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:08,200
we might have been at highs

663
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:11,559
before but some of us joined after

664
00:33:11,559 --> 00:33:15,720
that and we somehow thought here was

665
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:17,480
going to be the thing that brings us

666
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:21,600
back to the former

667
00:33:23,880 --> 00:33:28,360
high and when you hit resistance

668
00:33:28,360 --> 00:33:29,960
that should have sent

669
00:33:29,960 --> 00:33:33,919
you below the expectations that you came

670
00:33:33,919 --> 00:33:37,080
in with deeper

671
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:40,519
into all the information that's resting

672
00:33:40,519 --> 00:33:43,720
inside of here all the information that

673
00:33:43,720 --> 00:33:45,799
comes from the profitable people you

674
00:33:45,799 --> 00:33:48,799
even see in this

675
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:51,639
group they months months back they were

676
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:53,360
exactly where you

677
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:56,039
were but what did they do follow those

678
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:58,960
instructions

679
00:34:00,279 --> 00:34:04,399
and on the other side of

680
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:09,560
that bullishness but guess what with

681
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,520
some of them they'll

682
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:15,480
still have these highs and

683
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:20,960
lows that often times they come to run

684
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,720
little inside

685
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:28,040
low and they don't give up there

686
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,639
they know that it's just to bring us

687
00:34:31,639 --> 00:34:32,599
back

688
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:37,719
to wherever it is we were originally

689
00:34:37,719 --> 00:34:40,239
going they're aware of that they

690
00:34:40,239 --> 00:34:42,320
understand that and and they take these

691
00:34:42,320 --> 00:34:45,399
losses and they run to back test they

692
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:48,280
run to watch the video they go back to

693
00:34:48,280 --> 00:34:51,440
to whatever it is that help them to

694
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:53,040
build that understanding the first time

695
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,879
they Double Down On

696
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,000
It and that's when you see them trade

697
00:34:58,000 --> 00:35:00,560
higher and they ask questions like oh do

698
00:35:00,560 --> 00:35:02,839
you guys have down days do you guys have

699
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,359
bad days do you guys ever struggle do

700
00:35:05,359 --> 00:35:07,240
you guys you know like you have to be

701
00:35:07,240 --> 00:35:10,400
transparent with that journey of a

702
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,520
traiter which is entirely true but we do

703
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:17,720
have those down days but because a lot

704
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:21,800
of the stuff that we

705
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:25,560
did was a part of

706
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:28,480
structure those down days do not afford

707
00:35:28,480 --> 00:35:32,359
us to go any lower than a certain point

708
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:36,160
we just continue to mitigate these areas

709
00:35:36,160 --> 00:35:38,640
mitigate these these

710
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:40,950
INE

711
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,359
[Music]

712
00:35:42,359 --> 00:35:45,119
inefficiencies that's so funny mitigate

713
00:35:45,119 --> 00:35:46,760
these

714
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:49,040
inefficiencies that are left behind and

715
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,040
are winning winning winning winning and

716
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:52,640
we just come back to double down on

717
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:55,800
those so when we get back to the same

718
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:58,200
place we were last week or the same

719
00:35:58,200 --> 00:36:00,319
place we were last month we understand

720
00:36:00,319 --> 00:36:03,480
that even if we run the low of that

721
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,400
place doesn't

722
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:08,359
matter we we created a new hind look at

723
00:36:08,359 --> 00:36:10,839
look at where we came from look at all

724
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,560
the stuff we got through look at all the

725
00:36:13,560 --> 00:36:15,200
the issues that

726
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,599
arose and you found your way you were

727
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,119
you were down here you about to give up

728
00:36:20,119 --> 00:36:22,920
you about to break structure and go

729
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:26,359
spiraling support her resistance you but

730
00:36:26,359 --> 00:36:28,720
but what happened what

731
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,440
changed you did something

732
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:36,839
different so for anybody here you know

733
00:36:36,839 --> 00:36:38,400
doesn't have to be one person in

734
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:41,720
particular but for everybody here if

735
00:36:41,720 --> 00:36:44,400
you've lost a funded account

736
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:48,160
if you know you you lost a a personal

737
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:50,440
account whatever kind of a whatever kind

738
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:54,960
of account it was that that you you know

739
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:57,800
lost you need to understand that you can

740
00:36:57,800 --> 00:37:00,839
just buy another one right say Amen

741
00:37:00,839 --> 00:37:03,599
somebody you can just buy another I'm

742
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,680
kidding you need to understand that you

743
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,400
are not your funded

744
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:11,720
account that separate you from what's

745
00:37:11,720 --> 00:37:15,599
done on that account you are not your

746
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:20,119
fund that account lost not you they that

747
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,160
account that they were limited that

748
00:37:22,160 --> 00:37:25,599
account was limited and and that account

749
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,760
lost

750
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:30,160
but for me I took the lesson they took

751
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,680
the L and now I'm going to build on top

752
00:37:33,680 --> 00:37:36,400
of that I'm coming back for you

753
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,480
baby I know where I left

754
00:37:40,480 --> 00:37:44,280
you and and that's the energy that that

755
00:37:44,280 --> 00:37:47,680
you know you guys sort of have to uh

756
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:50,319
show up with you know you are not the

757
00:37:50,319 --> 00:37:52,920
mistakes you made on your funded

758
00:37:52,920 --> 00:37:55,880
account you are you you that's not you

759
00:37:55,880 --> 00:37:58,319
that's you learning

760
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:01,280
you can learn to lose $100,000 too

761
00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:04,319
though of your own money but you don't

762
00:38:04,319 --> 00:38:06,640
have to this is some of these funded

763
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,920
accounts are far cheaper than it is to

764
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:10,359
pay College

765
00:38:10,359 --> 00:38:12,680
tuition I always say it was a waste of

766
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,200
time for me to go to college I wish I

767
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,599
would have found this sooner I would

768
00:38:15,599 --> 00:38:17,640
have definitely been great at this even

769
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,480
if I found it sooner this is my speed

770
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,480
this is something that I I'm I'm an

771
00:38:22,480 --> 00:38:25,000
obsessive person I'm going to put in

772
00:38:25,000 --> 00:38:28,079
time to what I'm doing I'm going to

773
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:33,000
become the best at it the best that

774
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,079
means I'm going to study everybody else

775
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,560
their emotions their feelings their way

776
00:38:37,560 --> 00:38:39,680
of managing I'm going to study all of

777
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:42,040
that and then go in the lab and cook up

778
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,280
whatever it is that I can I I can afford

779
00:38:44,280 --> 00:38:48,480
to put in my own pot and cook it up in

780
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,319
back testing

781
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:52,839
right and then show up the next day and

782
00:38:52,839 --> 00:38:55,400
and and make it happen and if I wanted

783
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:58,280
to if I wanted to be really spicy I

784
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,200
would back test and forward test at the

785
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:01,839
same

786
00:39:01,839 --> 00:39:05,079
time back test and you come on y'all got

787
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:07,520
so many pairs Mark something out on

788
00:39:07,520 --> 00:39:10,000
another pair while you back tesed some

789
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:12,079
of the issues back tesed working out

790
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,560
where wherever it is you were having

791
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:14,720
trouble

792
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,480
with Mark that stuff out and go back to

793
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:21,839
it it's rewarding in itself back testing

794
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:23,760
may not feel like much go forward test

795
00:39:23,760 --> 00:39:25,440
with back testing

796
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,720
then and you know I feel like those

797
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:33,599
things will pick you back up again you

798
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:36,599
have to rely on some Kumbaya session or

799
00:39:36,599 --> 00:39:39,800
or or you know you don't have to go hire

800
00:39:39,800 --> 00:39:42,440
a coach or or whatever it is that's out

801
00:39:42,440 --> 00:39:45,119
there you can deal with it yourself just

802
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:47,359
by back testing yourself you know where

803
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:49,599
you go wrong every time you know where I

804
00:39:49,599 --> 00:39:52,079
was going wrong

805
00:39:52,079 --> 00:39:54,560
overleveraging that's where I was going

806
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:58,839
wrong overleveraging knowing the dollar

807
00:39:58,839 --> 00:40:02,119
amount that was enough for me and

808
00:40:02,119 --> 00:40:03,760
chasing

809
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:06,760
that

810
00:40:06,839 --> 00:40:09,400
but I still could

811
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:12,760
not just catch a little tiny move I know

812
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:15,480
I wanted $1,000 out of a trade I still

813
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:20,160
didn't even know how to get $5 from

814
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,960
it so so

815
00:40:23,960 --> 00:40:26,880
measurable targets

816
00:40:26,880 --> 00:40:30,000
measurable and practical trading if

817
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:32,800
price leaves you it left

818
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:36,160
you no reason to force a trade from the

819
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:38,960
other side of it wait for it to come

820
00:40:38,960 --> 00:40:41,160
back to you and there's lessons that you

821
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:43,160
learn in Waiting there's people that

822
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,839
would discourage you from sitting at the

823
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:47,480
chart and watching your setup or or

824
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:49,680
watching it come back to your area for

825
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:51,599
you to you know take an entry some

826
00:40:51,599 --> 00:40:54,599
people discourage that but you guys have

827
00:40:54,599 --> 00:40:57,319
to sit down and watch the learn stage of

828
00:40:57,319 --> 00:41:00,640
it watch everything that's happening why

829
00:41:00,640 --> 00:41:02,200
do you think I have all of these charts

830
00:41:02,200 --> 00:41:05,000
over here all all of these things you

831
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,400
don't think I go through through these

832
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:08,040
things every now and again and just Mark

833
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:09,839
out different things you know when

834
00:41:09,839 --> 00:41:13,200
whenever whenever I'm

835
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:20,800
ready

836
00:41:21,800 --> 00:41:24,359
got let me just look at this real quick

837
00:41:24,359 --> 00:41:25,240
I

838
00:41:25,240 --> 00:41:28,240
think

839
00:41:32,119 --> 00:41:34,440
was it

840
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:42,480
usdc oh yeah it was it

841
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:58,240
was

842
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:19,160
oh no no it was NZ USD nzd

843
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,480
USD so somebody had asked me on on

844
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:23,880
Twitter about it first of all they said

845
00:42:23,880 --> 00:42:26,559
it look interesting I'm next now when

846
00:42:26,559 --> 00:42:28,040
people write

847
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:30,599
that hold

848
00:42:30,599 --> 00:42:32,839
up sorry now when people write it looks

849
00:42:32,839 --> 00:42:34,079
interesed I'm just going to ask what's

850
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:36,880
interesting about it you know yes it did

851
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:38,599
it did I'm not going to say it look

852
00:42:38,599 --> 00:42:40,880
interested but I told the guy I said

853
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:42,680
we're going

854
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:45,960
below 59600 I said it's looking the

855
00:42:45,960 --> 00:42:48,200
market is looking look look at me with

856
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:51,280
with the genius

857
00:42:51,960 --> 00:42:56,680
the got my my my uh educator had I'm

858
00:42:56,680 --> 00:43:00,599
like well we're we're going below 59600

859
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:02,760
you guys have see my my TW my response

860
00:43:02,760 --> 00:43:06,000
on Twitter why did

861
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:11,359
I have an idea that we were going below

862
00:43:11,359 --> 00:43:15,240
this and why wouldn't I wait for any

863
00:43:15,240 --> 00:43:18,480
kind of Longs if I know that this is

864
00:43:18,480 --> 00:43:21,599
where price is reaching

865
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,319
into that's what I would do I would wait

866
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:28,000
on that so when I when I mentioned that

867
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:30,880
you saw this move go up like that and

868
00:43:30,880 --> 00:43:32,760
then what this breakdown occur right

869
00:43:32,760 --> 00:43:35,119
within

870
00:43:35,599 --> 00:43:37,760
here or was it over here I think it was

871
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:39,200
like early morning so it might have been

872
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:40,920
over there something like that but where

873
00:43:40,920 --> 00:43:43,760
do we end up going what direction were

874
00:43:43,760 --> 00:43:45,960
we looking for because of the narrative

875
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,839
that was already given to us I I don't

876
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:50,559
know if you guys um uh let me see what

877
00:43:50,559 --> 00:43:53,480
his name is in here he he uh posted some

878
00:43:53,480 --> 00:43:56,599
charts that um

879
00:43:56,599 --> 00:43:59,240
I know for a fact he's been in the

880
00:43:59,240 --> 00:44:01,800
playlist um I think it was Precision

881
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:04,079
trades I don't know if he's heing now

882
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:07,200
but I think it might have been Precision

883
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:10,240
trades um yeah yeah Precision trades he

884
00:44:10,240 --> 00:44:12,559
posted in the member spam section if you

885
00:44:12,559 --> 00:44:15,760
look at what he posts about video 4

886
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:18,440
only you look at what he post he's not

887
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:20,040
running around trying to take every

888
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:22,240
single entry 3050

889
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:25,160
70 all like trying to take everything

890
00:44:25,160 --> 00:44:27,480
every every WI way price goes and you

891
00:44:27,480 --> 00:44:31,240
know if you look at it he has very very

892
00:44:31,240 --> 00:44:34,079
detailed um I guess not very detailed

893
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:35,559
but there's some there's some

894
00:44:35,559 --> 00:44:39,119
annotations that are there that's

895
00:44:39,119 --> 00:44:41,720
helping them to understand what it is

896
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,280
that they're seeing in the context of

897
00:44:43,280 --> 00:44:45,160
the playlist alone and you don't see

898
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:47,800
them drawn out no large zones there you

899
00:44:47,800 --> 00:44:49,440
know yeah I'm going take this one up

900
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,480
there and then draw this larger one from

901
00:44:51,480 --> 00:44:53,119
down here and I'm going to take that one

902
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,079
up there that's something that will d

903
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,800
destroy your trading career before it

904
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,720
even

905
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:03,240
starts destroy your C your trading

906
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:05,000
career before it even

907
00:45:05,000 --> 00:45:07,599
starts all I used when I first started

908
00:45:07,599 --> 00:45:10,079
was the 50% and why do you think I was

909
00:45:10,079 --> 00:45:11,960
able to see all the other stuff going on

910
00:45:11,960 --> 00:45:13,240
around

911
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:16,240
it and pay attention to it oh yeah I

912
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:18,520
know that's the the you or or you might

913
00:45:18,520 --> 00:45:20,680
even know that's the 30 but do you know

914
00:45:20,680 --> 00:45:23,559
how to trade it no you just saw a tap on

915
00:45:23,559 --> 00:45:24,720
it and you thought we were ready to

916
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:26,640
trade higher

917
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,760
and then got clapped right after and

918
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,839
then try to take another trade after and

919
00:45:31,839 --> 00:45:34,200
got clapped again on that one because

920
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:36,319
when you realize you were invalidated

921
00:45:36,319 --> 00:45:38,559
you try to trade the opposite way to get

922
00:45:38,559 --> 00:45:40,160
the rest of the move and got invalidated

923
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,800
on that one

924
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:45,319
too those things are fixed in back

925
00:45:45,319 --> 00:45:47,000
testing and when you're back testing

926
00:45:47,000 --> 00:45:48,240
with

927
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:51,880
rules that's it when you're back testing

928
00:45:51,880 --> 00:45:54,640
with rules nothing else you should not

929
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,319
be aimlessly back back testing oh let me

930
00:45:57,319 --> 00:46:00,119
go back test a

931
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,720
flip let me let me go let me go back

932
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:05,359
test you know the the market

933
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:07,760
flipping yeah so you see if I just use

934
00:46:07,760 --> 00:46:10,680
the 50% of the flip then that'll be

935
00:46:10,680 --> 00:46:13,960
fine and you got zones from from

936
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:15,880
everywhere you don't

937
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:18,800
just yeah if if I just use the 50% of

938
00:46:18,800 --> 00:46:20,920
the

939
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:29,559
flip then it'll be it'll be

940
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:39,480
great the 50% of what

941
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:42,359
flip when you back to this this if your

942
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:45,480
chart looks like this I will ignore it

943
00:46:45,480 --> 00:46:46,880
you don't know what you're doing when

944
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:48,839
your chart looks like

945
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:52,559
that price is only doing one thing it's

946
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:57,280
either it's going up or it's going down

947
00:46:57,280 --> 00:46:59,599
and for you to have this idea that maybe

948
00:46:59,599 --> 00:47:01,240
it might be going up but maybe it also

949
00:47:01,240 --> 00:47:03,319
might be going down you shouldn't even

950
00:47:03,319 --> 00:47:07,280
be touching a button to trade

951
00:47:07,280 --> 00:47:09,559
with with that kind

952
00:47:09,559 --> 00:47:13,160
of I'm thinking that

953
00:47:13,160 --> 00:47:17,040
if I'm I'm getting ready to um uh use

954
00:47:17,040 --> 00:47:19,960
the the admins a lot more to speed up um

955
00:47:19,960 --> 00:47:22,839
uh well to clean up the group a bit

956
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:25,920
because what grinds my gears the most is

957
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,280
people saying that they have back tested

958
00:47:28,280 --> 00:47:30,839
and and you know learned certain things

959
00:47:30,839 --> 00:47:32,559
and then they're posting entries saying

960
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,000
maybe I

961
00:47:34,000 --> 00:47:37,640
think no get that off of The Forum

962
00:47:37,640 --> 00:47:40,000
there's no you think you're not that

963
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,960
that's not it's either it is or it isn't

964
00:47:41,960 --> 00:47:43,720
you sure about it or you

965
00:47:43,720 --> 00:47:46,720
not but there's no think cuz when it

966
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:48,839
come time to take your money they don't

967
00:47:48,839 --> 00:47:52,920
think gone ye your stop is they don't

968
00:47:52,920 --> 00:47:54,520
think about running your

969
00:47:54,520 --> 00:47:56,520
stop you you ever noticed that they get

970
00:47:56,520 --> 00:47:58,440
to you take profit and they they trade

971
00:47:58,440 --> 00:48:01,000
away for every just a little bit see a

972
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:03,640
little consolidating r take profit look

973
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:05,040
like it's go in there again and go away

974
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,000
from a little bit you ever seen him go

975
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,839
to your stop loss

976
00:48:08,839 --> 00:48:12,680
ye straight through it supposed to take

977
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:15,440
you out there but took you out

978
00:48:15,440 --> 00:48:18,079
[Laughter]

979
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,520
there so

980
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,839
um we really have to realign what it is

981
00:48:24,839 --> 00:48:26,720
we're back testing

982
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,040
you're you're back testing one thing

983
00:48:29,040 --> 00:48:31,359
until you get so good at that that now

984
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:33,319
you can back test the next thing and

985
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:35,400
then when you get so good at that now

986
00:48:35,400 --> 00:48:37,319
you can back test the next thing and

987
00:48:37,319 --> 00:48:39,160
then when you get so good at that now

988
00:48:39,160 --> 00:48:40,839
you can back test the next thing and

989
00:48:40,839 --> 00:48:42,559
then when you get so good at that now

990
00:48:42,559 --> 00:48:44,720
you can back to and when you look back

991
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,280
on all of

992
00:48:46,280 --> 00:48:51,839
it man oh man growth that the that's on

993
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,680
the other side of that that that type of

994
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,400
energy only comes from putting your head

995
00:48:55,400 --> 00:48:59,240
down down and getting to

996
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:02,400
work you are not ready to push the

997
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:06,200
button if you cannot say where price is

998
00:49:06,200 --> 00:49:09,799
going and your entry is not

999
00:49:09,799 --> 00:49:12,760
actionable

1000
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,599
enough to to take it there and and what

1001
00:49:15,599 --> 00:49:18,520
I mean by that is a lot of you guys be

1002
00:49:18,520 --> 00:49:20,720
trading and and maybe not you guys but

1003
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:23,359
just people in general a lot of people

1004
00:49:23,359 --> 00:49:26,680
trade within this environment

1005
00:49:26,680 --> 00:49:29,000
and marry moves in

1006
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:31,880
this they marry shorts that are going

1007
00:49:31,880 --> 00:49:33,760
down and goes back to take them out they

1008
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:35,720
marry Longs that are going up it goes

1009
00:49:35,720 --> 00:49:37,960
back to take them out they marry shorts

1010
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:39,640
that are going down it goes back to run

1011
00:49:39,640 --> 00:49:42,880
their stop they marry Longs oh yeah we

1012
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,839
flipped in here yeah now we going up

1013
00:49:44,839 --> 00:49:46,760
then it takes them out like

1014
00:49:46,760 --> 00:49:51,119
that marry marry shorts here price

1015
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:54,839
trades up moves down into here equal low

1016
00:49:54,839 --> 00:49:56,839
here and now they're doubling down on

1017
00:49:56,839 --> 00:49:59,319
their short within

1018
00:49:59,319 --> 00:50:02,200
there we have to stop that kind of

1019
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:06,240
trading if we actually want some

1020
00:50:06,240 --> 00:50:08,640
progress and that means that

1021
00:50:08,640 --> 00:50:10,000
understanding what it is that we're

1022
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:14,480
doing before we even push the button is

1023
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:16,079
important

1024
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:19,559
before you need measurable

1025
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:22,680
targets you need specific entries that

1026
00:50:22,680 --> 00:50:27,280
you do not deviate from this is the only

1027
00:50:27,280 --> 00:50:29,839
kind of Entry I'm willing to take some

1028
00:50:29,839 --> 00:50:34,280
of y'all need oneto ones go back to the

1029
00:50:34,280 --> 00:50:37,040
basics get that tap into the 50 and let

1030
00:50:37,040 --> 00:50:38,559
it come out of the zone and that's it

1031
00:50:38,559 --> 00:50:40,000
that's where you close it up because you

1032
00:50:40,000 --> 00:50:42,520
can't trust yourself on anything

1033
00:50:42,520 --> 00:50:45,760
else right

1034
00:50:46,400 --> 00:50:50,599
now so I mean I'm I'm having this

1035
00:50:50,599 --> 00:50:53,520
session not not just for uh uh one of

1036
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,640
the students but but for everybody in

1037
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:02,079
general that you need to know what you

1038
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:05,280
are doing you cannot afford to come in

1039
00:51:05,280 --> 00:51:09,319
here and guess and then think that that

1040
00:51:09,319 --> 00:51:12,839
your emotions won't you know take some

1041
00:51:12,839 --> 00:51:16,040
sort of damage from

1042
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,400
it so um I know that message is for for

1043
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,720
quite a few people not just for one um

1044
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:28,200
and and if the shoe fit you know lace

1045
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:30,160
that stitch up

1046
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:33,400
because you you want to do things to

1047
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:36,000
rule out or or to get rid of the

1048
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:38,799
unnecessary quirks or behaviors that you

1049
00:51:38,799 --> 00:51:40,760
have within your trading now you want to

1050
00:51:40,760 --> 00:51:44,880
do something to to you know quell or get

1051
00:51:44,880 --> 00:51:47,839
rid of those issues because as you as

1052
00:51:47,839 --> 00:51:50,240
you grow as your account size gets

1053
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:53,960
bigger as your your um uh position

1054
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,839
sizing you know get gets larger these

1055
00:51:56,839 --> 00:51:58,839
same things are going to show

1056
00:51:58,839 --> 00:52:01,200
up you might think it's nothing with a

1057
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:02,880
little one lot two lot but when you

1058
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,280
start trading on on larger size

1059
00:52:06,280 --> 00:52:09,400
then now all of a sudden a psychology

1060
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,520
session needs to be booked when it's the

1061
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:12,559
same

1062
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:18,319
move it's the same move the same thing

1063
00:52:18,319 --> 00:52:23,119
no matter what's behind it it's the same

1064
00:52:23,240 --> 00:52:25,839
move so if price is doing the same thing

1065
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,960
every

1066
00:52:27,960 --> 00:52:33,640
day and you have a losing day what

1067
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:35,960
changed it wasn't

1068
00:52:35,960 --> 00:52:38,839
price it wasn't the

1069
00:52:38,839 --> 00:52:42,160
algorithm it wasn't manual intervention

1070
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:44,040
or or whatever these things are that

1071
00:52:44,040 --> 00:52:46,400
people you know just seek and destroy

1072
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:49,839
and and and like whatever it is they say

1073
00:52:49,839 --> 00:52:52,319
for not understanding what price is

1074
00:52:52,319 --> 00:52:54,240
actually

1075
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:56,680
doing

1076
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,000
so that means that every time we take a

1077
00:52:58,000 --> 00:52:59,599
higher time frame higher low seek could

1078
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:02,160
destroy starts and there's no way you

1079
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:03,839
could get involved in that at all

1080
00:53:03,839 --> 00:53:04,920
because

1081
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:07,440
because let not even go go that route

1082
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:10,400
you know save that for the mentorship um

1083
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:12,599
but I'm going to put this video on

1084
00:53:12,599 --> 00:53:15,480
YouTube because this is not just for for

1085
00:53:15,480 --> 00:53:19,400
you guys this is also

1086
00:53:19,400 --> 00:53:22,839
for you know like everyone that will

1087
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:25,920
come into this space everyone whether

1088
00:53:25,920 --> 00:53:28,079
it's the trading space whether it's the

1089
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:30,880
mentorship no matter what it is this you

1090
00:53:30,880 --> 00:53:34,280
guys have to be realistic about it I had

1091
00:53:34,280 --> 00:53:36,440
600 bucks when I

1092
00:53:36,440 --> 00:53:39,559
started and that's all I had to my name

1093
00:53:39,559 --> 00:53:41,720
if I lost that I was

1094
00:53:41,720 --> 00:53:46,680
done done and dusted it was over for

1095
00:53:46,680 --> 00:53:49,200
me but knowing what was on the other

1096
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,839
side of that and knowing the amount of

1097
00:53:51,839 --> 00:53:56,319
pressure I applied to to you know like

1098
00:53:56,319 --> 00:53:57,520
uh

1099
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:00,280
uh what I was doing in school and even

1100
00:54:00,280 --> 00:54:02,720
when I was studying for school I wasn't

1101
00:54:02,720 --> 00:54:06,240
out there going to parties I wasn't you

1102
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:08,920
know watching all this TV and and all

1103
00:54:08,920 --> 00:54:10,119
that stuff

1104
00:54:10,119 --> 00:54:13,240
no I was taking 21 credits this semester

1105
00:54:13,240 --> 00:54:15,799
and working two jobs and volunteering on

1106
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:18,079
the

1107
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:21,760
side volunteering two jobs that were

1108
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:25,160
paying me in different cities and taking

1109
00:54:25,160 --> 00:54:28,400
21 credits and putting them on two days

1110
00:54:28,400 --> 00:54:30,200
out of the week so guess what when

1111
00:54:30,200 --> 00:54:33,200
finals came around do you know how

1112
00:54:33,200 --> 00:54:36,680
unbearable that F that had to be like

1113
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:40,079
the worst part of the semester was

1114
00:54:40,079 --> 00:54:41,440
finals and

1115
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:43,480
midterms because guess what if you

1116
00:54:43,480 --> 00:54:46,720
taking 21 credits look at how many and

1117
00:54:46,720 --> 00:54:49,720

1122
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:01,000
what but I was able to to create a

1123
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:05,440
system around that that got rid of what

1124
00:55:05,440 --> 00:55:07,880
partying that got rid of what

1125
00:55:07,880 --> 00:55:11,839
friends that got rid of what all of this

1126
00:55:11,839 --> 00:55:15,640
extracurricular activity that had no

1127
00:55:15,640 --> 00:55:17,960
bearing on whether I would be successful

1128
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:21,200
in what I was studying or

1129
00:55:21,200 --> 00:55:24,000
not so I got rid of

1130
00:55:24,000 --> 00:55:25,960
that

1131
00:55:25,960 --> 00:55:28,119
sometimes it's just in that I was

1132
00:55:28,119 --> 00:55:30,400
playing video games when I first

1133
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:32,720
started even when I was pulling money

1134
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,160
out of the market I was still playing a

1135
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:36,520
little bit of video games and the minute

1136
00:55:36,520 --> 00:55:38,440

1137
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:41,119
rid of all that yes there's balance but

1138
00:55:41,119 --> 00:55:43,920
