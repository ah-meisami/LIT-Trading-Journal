1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:02,159
so there's this imbalance in here that

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:03,760
this is where price tapped there's a

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,080
tiny imbalance within this area here may

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:09,080
we can just plop that

5
00:00:09,080 --> 00:00:12,080
line

6
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,199
there right there maybe

7
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,720
yeah yeah there so this came down tapped

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,199
into this imbalance

9
00:00:28,199 --> 00:00:30,240
here telling you guys I'm going to and

10
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,239
balance you guys to death oh my

11
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:36,960
gosh but it just makes sense because it

12
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:39,879
it it works so well I mean look at this

13
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,120
the tap of this imbalance if we weren't

14
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:43,800
fooling around with the chart we would

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,520
have probably saw this but top of this

16
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,520
imbalance to possibly this one up here

17
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,879
um maybe even a little higher to this

18
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,559
this is the last High uh if price gets

19
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,039
there sometimes it doesn't um so let's

20
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,280
see we ran through

21
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,200
here oh it tapped into this area so yeah

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,640
it could reject from here um and push

23
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,600
further down

24
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,880
possibly then it'll look like this

25
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,400
little

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:21,360
um this

27
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,360
uh Head and Shoulders

28
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:30,880
maybe maybe you have a test back into

29
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,680
the area and then continue to fall out

30
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:36,200
of the area to maybe whatever snd is

31
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,920
responsible or imbalance so it could be

32
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:42,840
like here it could be here you can get a

33
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,479
little bounce up here to take you back

34
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,680
up to maybe this area here um when price

35
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:53,439
runs this low here you could have a pull

36
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,719
back up into that area and

37
00:01:55,719 --> 00:01:59,039
continue might find some support on the

38
00:01:59,039 --> 00:02:02,159
fractal continue up another fractal

39
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,119
continue up imbalance continue up snd

40
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,080
Blast Off could be like something like

41
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:14,360
that but we'll

42
00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:16,599
see oh

43
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:19,080
I so the people was on my zoom last

44
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:21,000
night they kind of understand where I

45
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,080
placed this and why I'm doing this and

46
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:25,400
why I'm expecting the rejection out of

47
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,080
this you

48
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,560
know and it could very well come to this

49
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:33,080
this area here still mitigate this

50
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:36,920
still but this is

51
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,519
um this is the hidden snd um that I talk

52
00:02:40,519 --> 00:02:43,800
about usually it's a a long Wick that

53
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:47,680
runs a low and then pushes up and takes

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,720
out the high so usually price sometimes

55
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:53,200
will return back to this area before

56
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:56,200
trading higher because this area had the

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:59,120
overall responsibility of pushing price

58
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:01,760
up

59
00:03:02,920 --> 00:03:05,680
yeah oh you just asked that yeah how do

60
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:08,000
you spot hit in snds so yeah that that's

61
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,200
it that that um the the wick comes

62
00:03:12,200 --> 00:03:15,480
down and then instantly goes up to break

63
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:16,879
a

64
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:21,519
high so then um this is manipulation we

65
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,000
ran this low here or this looks like a

66
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,280
equal let me see ohlc uh

67
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,879
252 and this is

68
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:36,280
uh 253 so look we we just ran that low

69
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:38,560
just ran it by a

70
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,480
pip and pushed up and we ran the high

71
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:43,799
above

72
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
to so we could very well be coming back

73
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,280
down to this area here to trade higher I

74
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:51,560
think this was the tap here though so if

75
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:53,280
you get a run of this High you might get

76
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:55,400
a pull back into this area and then a

77
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:58,079
continuation

78
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:01,680
above

79
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,840
or maybe even down to this Wick

80
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,760
here oh yeah like

81
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:14,079
beep so if it get stuck at this snd then

82
00:04:14,079 --> 00:04:16,839
obviously you know it's the

83
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:20,560
um well if it get stuck up here it'll be

84
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:22,479
like the equal High looking to

85
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,400
potentially run the

86
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,440
low

87
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,039
I really wish I could listen to um

88
00:04:33,039 --> 00:04:35,199
Regular Music on here in my playlist I

89
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:37,160
have such a fire playlist I know you

90
00:04:37,160 --> 00:04:41,880
guys probably don't listen to um EDM or

91
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,600
or um you know house um but that's

92
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,360
that's like the new wave of of music now

93
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:53,080
um and uh like you see everybody's

94
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:55,039
making it Beyonce just came out with a

95
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,840
song that was house music uh maybe this

96
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,720
tapped into this imbalance here this

97
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,000
little sneaky guy let me see hold on

98
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,520
real quick

99
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,560
guys oh no you didn't haha lucky um but

100
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:15,199
yeah um you know uh um you see Beyonce

101
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:16,840
just created a house album I mean a

102
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,039
house song um or you know EDM like song

103
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:25,560
um and uh you know that's where most of

104
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,680
the people are shifting to because again

105
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:30,039
if America's going into a recession that

106
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:33,720
means that there's not going to be um

107
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:35,199
you know any

108
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,840
profitability with the people who are

109
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:42,360
within this country so now they have to

110
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:44,479
Branch out what's the music in the

111
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:47,360
genres that people listen to abroad who

112
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,000
may not be affected by America's

113
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,360
recession mainly house in

114
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:56,400
EDM so even with them they're shifting

115
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,800
and turning the Landscapes of of just

116
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,560
like what they're traditional music is

117
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:03,000
to shift with the times not just the

118
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,680
times but where the money is so they're

119
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,240
essentially following the money maybe I

120
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,919
could open this chart a little more for

121
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:12,199
you guys a little wider for you guys to

122
00:06:12,199 --> 00:06:14,280
see I realize that it's really wide on

123
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:16,080
my screen and sometimes it looks very

124
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,960
small on the stream um so just you know

125
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,120
let me know about that if if that does

126
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,120
happen

127
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,960
[Music]

128
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:32,080
um Rev taken off again what what exactly

129
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,360
is

130
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,000
Rev Revlon oh the the Hair Company blow

131
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,319
dryer

132
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:45,840
company taking oh brother we look barish

133
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:48,479
I don't know

134
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:52,680
what we okay we tapped into an

135
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:55,840
area I don't really like this

136
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,479
area um we did get a double bottom on it

137
00:06:59,479 --> 00:07:02,400
it but I don't know if that's

138
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,680
because okay better um

139
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:12,080
but now we had this bounce here we

140
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,639
tapped up

141
00:07:13,639 --> 00:07:16,240
into we tapped up

142
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,720
into the um imbalance Above So this

143
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:22,960
might be a rejection that runs the

144
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:25,440
low uh so you might want to be careful

145
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:31,280
with that um that uh uh r

146
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,199
is serum we have CCO and Kina not

147
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,479
touched by the

148
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:42,840
West um we mean not touched by the West

149
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:44,520
the the

150
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,879
uh those um little small lands off the

151
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:53,919
coast um would you wait for it to break

152
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:56,280
structure then get in or would you wait

153
00:07:56,280 --> 00:08:01,319
for it to break structure below um

154
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:04,360
so

155
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,120
with go back to this so see it's still

156
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:10,560
at the rejection point we just ran the

157
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,840
low of it so we could have a tuck back

158
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,080
into this area we could have like 15 20

159
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,159
more minutes um of consolidation

160
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:25,840
sideways um before potentially

161
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,240
shorting

162
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,559
but yeah this

163
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,799
essentially so look we just ran this low

164
00:08:38,799 --> 00:08:40,320
right

165
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:43,958
here this smaller low just got hit sorry

166
00:08:43,958 --> 00:08:45,320
bro I'm talking about the music what's a

167
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:48,720
bit late oh okay

168
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,120
okay I'm like yeah uh I don't I'm I

169
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:54,720
can't recall what that was for but yeah

170
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:56,560
okay the music so yeah this looks like

171
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,959
it's going bearish um we ran this low

172
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,880
here here um after the top of this area

173
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:05,120
so now

174
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,680
we let me move this uh now we look

175
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,200
to so now we could potentially come up

176
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:16,160
to this area and tap this snd and we

177
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,000
already tapped this one tap this one

178
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,279
rejected down here we could potentially

179
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,360
tap this one and then continue down um

180
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:26,560
or we can just continue down from here

181
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,600
but this was the imbalance touch this

182
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,320
tap right

183
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:33,480
here remember the imbalance to the left

184
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:36,519
I said that it wasn't tapped into as of

185
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:40,160
yet from here this was the touch so now

186
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:42,640
you want to watch and see what it does

187
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:44,880
here because if we end up flipping back

188
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,880
up to the upside we want to make sure

189
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,760
that you know we're not going to take

190
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:53,360
any of the

191
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,440
highs but this was just a tap on the I

192
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,720
should I I should should have actually

193
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,440
put this price balloon here

194
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:11,360
um whatever uh so yeah look at this here

195
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:12,519
we just want to make sure it doesn't

196
00:10:12,519 --> 00:10:16,320
flip above here um because then it'll

197
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,560
look like it's the double top coming out

198
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,360
of the area to trade

199
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,720
higher but look at that that imbalance

200
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:27,279
tap that's 23 Pips up in one

201
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,760
candle just off of the of

202
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:35,079
it and know we short

203
00:10:36,680 --> 00:10:40,560
and I don't have Rona by the way

204
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:45,440
so it's just a cough that was dust in my

205
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,920
throat I don't have

206
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,320
it let me

207
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:58,040
stop uh so we have this imbalance

208
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:00,560
here is it just targets if we're

209
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:02,920
shorting you potentially shorting to

210
00:11:02,920 --> 00:11:04,399
some of these areas where you could

211
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,240
expect a bounce up but again when we

212
00:11:07,240 --> 00:11:09,519
come below certain lows we often get a

213
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:12,079
cross of the low and then potentially a

214
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,839
pushup so we want to watch

215
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,200
that oh but this was

216
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:27,959
the the low that I was

217
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:30,959
saying

218
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,839
look at that little Candlestick

219
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:36,760
formation that I talked to you guys

220
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,240
about this

221
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:42,000
here and the thing is with this often

222
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
times when you have price trade out

223
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,480
sometimes price just comes to test this

224
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,279
area and then it'll continue

225
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:58,480
short also if you guys have any other

226
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,360
tickers you want me to um to look at um

227
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:04,959
I'll definitely look at it let me

228
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,680
actually go back to this rev thing cuz I

229
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,160
realize that this guy is saying that

230
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:12,120
it's going to

231
00:12:12,120 --> 00:12:15,040
$10 um and I just want to see how far

232
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,639
away or our unlikely $10

233
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:22,639
is

234
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,279
um so we put in the

235
00:12:26,279 --> 00:12:30,880
high we have a low

236
00:12:30,920 --> 00:12:33,040
so price is in this

237
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:36,320
range right

238
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,519
here oh this was a gap right

239
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:50,680
here this area down here is a gap up so

240
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:53,760
price is within this range within this

241
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,519
range we

242
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:02,600
have this hidden snd that's

243
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:07,279
here we have this hidden snd

244
00:13:07,279 --> 00:13:11,399
above we go to the 4

245
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,720
Hour so we put in this low we failed to

246
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:22,279
run this high or establish a new high so

247
00:13:22,279 --> 00:13:24,360
we're running the low which we just ran

248
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:30,199
inside of there um if you guys look here

249
00:13:30,199 --> 00:13:32,480
so we expect price to come back into the

250
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,440
range of this it Taps into the range and

251
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,720
yeah BR I think this is bearish I I

252
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:44,000
don't I don't see anything working in in

253
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:50,160
the favor of of bullishness let

254
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:57,759
mean yeah I think this is

255
00:13:57,759 --> 00:14:00,040
uh

256
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:01,839
I think this is a gap

257
00:14:01,839 --> 00:14:05,279
fill filled the Gap we tapped on

258
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:06,839
something in here I think we said it was

259
00:14:06,839 --> 00:14:09,920
an imbalance

260
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,560
maybe but the imbalance could just be oh

261
00:14:15,560 --> 00:14:19,040
yeah cuz it hit this imbalance

262
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,600
too so yeah unless we're coming back to

263
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:26,360
this area a second time maybe $9 I would

264
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,680
say maybe but I mean it does

265
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:33,560
I could be wrong you know it just

266
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:34,920
doesn't give me

267
00:14:34,920 --> 00:14:38,920
any um indication

268
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:41,839
that that we're going

269
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,720
up um not only that let me see what area

270
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:48,279
we hit

271
00:14:57,079 --> 00:14:59,440
here oh actually I should have did that

272
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,440
on on this time frame I'm

273
00:15:13,959 --> 00:15:17,560
tripping yeah yeah man this um this hit

274
00:15:17,560 --> 00:15:19,360
a

275
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:25,759
um daily imbalance and rejected from it

276
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:29,880
um left imbalance to the bottom side as

277
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,000
well as this area that when it flipped

278
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:35,040
up above so you you could have it come

279
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,480
back to

280
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,160
here you could have it come back to

281
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:42,759
there um

282
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,040
potentially I mean that's that

283
00:15:46,040 --> 00:15:48,360
that's I don't know maybe I would put

284
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,839
that bad boy or something may maybe this

285
00:15:50,839 --> 00:15:52,480
is news like maybe something happened

286
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,959
somebody's buying them out or something

287
00:15:53,959 --> 00:15:59,160
I don't know um but it looks

288
00:15:59,160 --> 00:16:01,240
the move looks late if you're looking to

289
00:16:01,240 --> 00:16:04,120
buy it looks like it's coming down

290
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:08,319
so yeah that's um that's that's what I

291
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:10,839
have there my man so hopefully that

292
00:16:10,839 --> 00:16:16,600
helps um good morning yo yo W

293
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:20,000
brother what's up it's my Jamaican

294
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:23,560
brother over there khif how's everything

295
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:25,800
so look you see we tapped well I don't

296
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,279
know what we tapped here so let me not

297
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:29,800
even make up anything we tap something

298
00:16:29,800 --> 00:16:31,600
in here from the lower time frame more

299
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:34,199
than likely um but we mentioned that we

300
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:36,319
could possibly come back up to this area

301
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:40,680
here um I should have actually put this

302
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:44,079
here so we have two unmitigated

303
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,480
areas um up

304
00:16:46,480 --> 00:16:50,399
there and then we also have this area

305
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:53,079
here with this

306
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,600
imbalance but if it goes above this then

307
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,440
we would be coming up to

308
00:17:08,810 --> 00:17:11,869
[Music]

309
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:17,079
here so I realized that there's not much

310
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,919
um latency

311
00:17:18,919 --> 00:17:22,760
anymore um in terms of how long it takes

312
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:24,480
between when I say something and when

313
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:27,240
you guys hear it it's not as much um I

314
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:28,880
don't know what that particular change

315
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,799
was for um

316
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:35,160
but yeah that that was pretty

317
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,919
awesome let see I

318
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:42,039
have this here but we already tapped

319
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:46,919
into that so now if we do come back up

320
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,240
here we could potentially be looking at

321
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,039
either this or

322
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:58,120
this if we come up above here we could

323
00:17:58,120 --> 00:18:01,200
be looking at a rejection within this

324
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:05,120
region to come back

325
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,679
down but then this is also that

326
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,960
vshape pattern that I tell you tell you

327
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:12,000
guys

328
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,400
about as well as this is still around

329
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,520
the imbalance this had one touch of the

330
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,000
imbalance this had the second touch and

331
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,960
then look oh I didn't even spot this

332
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:24,880
this is that little pattern that I tell

333
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,640
you guys to look out for you going try

334
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:29,760
to train your eyes to look out for like

335
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:33,360
that because it's

336
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,840
essentially you know then when you come

337
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,480
down here

338
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,039
um you go back

339
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:45,400
up tap into the area and then

340
00:18:45,400 --> 00:18:49,320
leave so this little pattern

341
00:18:49,320 --> 00:18:53,360
here is what I try to get you guys

342
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:57,320
to like understand and

343
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:58,840
learn

344
00:18:58,840 --> 00:19:01,120
because if you could learn that look at

345
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,960
you see this looks like an inverse Head

346
00:19:02,960 --> 00:19:05,320
and Shoulders but if you look it has

347
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,559
rules this High here is slightly above

348
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:13,240
this high so we put in this low we put

349
00:19:13,240 --> 00:19:16,320
in this High we put in another low and

350
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,960
then we ran the last high so we tuck

351
00:19:19,960 --> 00:19:22,159
back into the range of the area and then

352
00:19:22,159 --> 00:19:24,760
we leave and that's exactly what just

353
00:19:24,760 --> 00:19:27,520
happened right here and it happened on

354
00:19:27,520 --> 00:19:30,240
the imbalance

355
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:34,080
so that's Prime for you to you know th

356
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:36,120
this could potentially even take this

357
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:41,120
High um when this happens on the

358
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:43,720
imbalance um but we do you see how we

359
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:45,880
came up to this area here I had

360
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:47,080
mentioned

361
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:52,240
um we could potentially run up to this

362
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:54,400
uh and it looks like we might be taking

363
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,080
the high now areas that we have so we

364
00:19:57,080 --> 00:19:58,520
have mentioned last night that that we

365
00:19:58,520 --> 00:20:02,520
were coming back down to this area here

366
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,600
um and this morning when I woke up

367
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,640
um I actually saw it tap right into this

368
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:11,919
area give us the Candlestick pattern we

369
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:14,400
like to see and like I said price oft

370
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,440
times come back come back to test that

371
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,919
pattern the the bullish

372
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:22,440
flip you know price comes back to test

373
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:25,280
it cuz you see it left this whole area

374
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:28,679
here after it pushed away there should

375
00:20:28,679 --> 00:20:30,200
have been like a little double bottom

376
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:32,400
somewhere within here and then leave but

377
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,919
it's mitigating itself as it's leaving

378
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:36,480
if it's not going to come

379
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:38,720
back but because you had this double

380
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:41,120
bottom and then this push right away we

381
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:43,799
had the area tap back into it and this

382
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,360
is why I say I I taught this secret to

383
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:48,360
some of these guys um yesterday but to

384
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:51,080
you guys even as well you know like I

385
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:52,760
told you guys take a double bottom a

386
00:20:52,760 --> 00:20:55,200
double top don't don't care about the

387
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:56,840
Wicks that are there because the Wicks

388
00:20:56,840 --> 00:20:59,280
are just manipulation place a square

389
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,720
around it and watch price come back to

390
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:04,840
the center of the area and leave look at

391
00:21:04,840 --> 00:21:06,600
this this is another another double top

392
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,360
up

393
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:10,799
here but this is actually where the

394
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:12,880
double top is look at how price comes

395
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,200
back to the center of it and

396
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,320
leaves oh but this is a double bottom

397
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,760
here look at how price trades above it

398
00:21:20,760 --> 00:21:23,039
comes back to the center of it didn't

399
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:25,520
leave so that's that's sauce that I was

400
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:28,159
showing some of these guys yesterday but

401
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,360
you know like we do this you know all

402
00:21:31,360 --> 00:21:33,880
the time we talk about this we we try to

403
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:36,520
like just hypothesize different things

404
00:21:36,520 --> 00:21:38,840
that price does and and and how we could

405
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,799
kind of get better at you know trading

406
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:45,000
and um you know we come up with some

407
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,760
pretty neat stuff you know we got some

408
00:21:46,760 --> 00:21:48,559
other guys who have some amazing

409
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:52,080
techniques as well um some guys who stay

410
00:21:52,080 --> 00:21:56,200
up late night owls you know um but look

411
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:58,480
you you get this is what I'm I'm talking

412
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:00,400
about with this let me let me just uh

413
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,720
show you guys this I get real excited

414
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,600
when I see this look at how within your

415
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,880
area of Entry you get the Candlestick

416
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:13,400
pattern of this but if you zoom out look

417
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,640
at how within this

418
00:22:15,640 --> 00:22:20,000
area the structural pattern follows it

419
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:21,600
let me move this here

420
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,880
too and

421
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:27,640
this if you guys look the structural

422
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:28,640
pattern

423
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,080
follows it as

424
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,640
well so it's not just the Candlestick

425
00:22:33,640 --> 00:22:36,400
pattern in there the structural pattern

426
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,960
follows it and when the structural

427
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:41,440
pattern follows it then overall you may

428
00:22:41,440 --> 00:22:45,240
see like higher higher highs put in

429
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:47,200
because the structural pattern is

430
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,320
stronger than the the

431
00:22:49,320 --> 00:22:51,480
Candlestick uh pattern so the

432
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,720
Candlestick pattern is what I use when

433
00:22:53,720 --> 00:22:56,080
I'm at my areas where I want to

434
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:59,360
enter so I'd be using this because we

435
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:02,600
hit this snd back here this area here I

436
00:23:02,600 --> 00:23:04,240
had circled this area for them last

437
00:23:04,240 --> 00:23:06,360
night and I said this area is

438
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:08,279
responsible for the break of structure

439
00:23:08,279 --> 00:23:11,200
above so when price comes back into it

440
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,440
it could tap into this area and leave

441
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:16,559
higher that's why I had this put out

442
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:19,760
here so price gets to the area and now

443
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:22,240
you get your double bottom within the

444
00:23:22,240 --> 00:23:24,400
area but you also get the Candlestick

445
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,240
pattern that we like to see so then

446
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:30,400
price pushes is up and you get the

447
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,840
Candlestick pattern to the top side as

448
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:35,520
well but what happens price comes back

449
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,919
to this

450
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:40,640
area within this area that it left

451
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:43,480
behind and what do we get the same

452
00:23:43,480 --> 00:23:45,159
Candlestick pattern

453
00:23:45,159 --> 00:23:49,679
again knowing that if we did take this

454
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,640
long we came back into the area we can

455
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,880
take this long again out of the

456
00:23:56,880 --> 00:24:00,520
area but we got our confirmations within

457
00:24:00,520 --> 00:24:02,880
there and it was just finding those

458
00:24:02,880 --> 00:24:05,480
patterns within the areas of our

459
00:24:05,480 --> 00:24:08,799
entries and that's you know just the

460
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,440
Simplicity of of what we were learning

461
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:12,640
um on

462
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,720
Zoom um and you know I look forward to

463
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:18,960
to doing that a lot more

464
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:22,120
um you know throughout the days

465
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,320
throughout the nights whenever it is um

466
00:24:24,320 --> 00:24:26,799
genuinely um had a lot of

467
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,919
fun

468
00:24:28,919 --> 00:24:31,480
uh hello Dave how are you I heard you

469
00:24:31,480 --> 00:24:33,360
you on a live Zoom call how can we be

470
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:35,200
part of this um do you do this on a

471
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,200
regular basis so I I do Zoom calls every

472
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:40,360
now and again you as sparingly it's not

473
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:42,640
a real schedule for it last night I

474
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,039
actually um I had a friend who I wanted

475
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,080
to show some stuff with

476
00:24:47,080 --> 00:24:52,320
um uh uh trading and um you know I asked

477
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,480
them if it was okay if other people um

478
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:56,080
came in too so I could just teach

479
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,159
everybody in one session and he said it

480
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:00,640
was cool so I had sent it out to the

481
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:04,240
group um this is the the telegram group

482
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,120
um I sent it to that remember we have

483
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:07,919
these levels up here guys we just want

484
00:25:07,919 --> 00:25:10,440
to make sure that they're not tapping

485
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:13,559
into um so we do have this level from

486
00:25:13,559 --> 00:25:15,760
across the way we still have price

487
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,520
lingering in this area um you could have

488
00:25:19,520 --> 00:25:23,080
these little pushes up but often times

489
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:24,799
um that doesn't signify that it's

490
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:27,159
breaking out to go higher into like the

491
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:28,200
400

492
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:30,159
um there's just things that need to

493
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,520
happen um before then so I had mentioned

494
00:25:32,520 --> 00:25:37,120
that we were breaking to um the upside

495
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
uh here we could possibly run the high

496
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,080
because of what happened within our

497
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:45,440
imbalance here so if you look

498
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,679
here and this is why I want you guys to

499
00:25:47,679 --> 00:25:50,320
be able to spot the imbalances yourself

500
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,440
because you can see when price gets into

501
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:56,679
an area of an imbalance right

502
00:25:56,679 --> 00:26:00,399
here tiny one right inside of here what

503
00:26:00,399 --> 00:26:02,640
happens in our area of

504
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,960
imbalance that Candlestick pattern that

505
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:08,080
we like to see so we get the Candlestick

506
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,480
pattern and then we get the test of it

507
00:26:11,480 --> 00:26:13,960
and then we go you see what I said this

508
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:15,520
pattern is important and why I'm

509
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,000
drilling it in you guys heads so you

510
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:20,760
understand this we tapped into this

511
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,760
imbalance we got the Candlestick pattern

512
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:26,559
that we were looking for Price traded up

513
00:26:26,559 --> 00:26:28,120
and came back and tested tested the

514
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,640
pattern and then left that's the same

515
00:26:30,640 --> 00:26:33,880
thing that happened here we got not only

516
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:36,159
did we get the Candlestick pattern but

517
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:39,039
we also got the structural pattern

518
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:41,960
too so when the Candlestick pattern was

519
00:26:41,960 --> 00:26:45,640
formed here price came back to test it

520
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,559
let me um just clean some of this up

521
00:26:47,559 --> 00:26:49,520
because it looks ugly price came back to

522
00:26:49,520 --> 00:26:52,760
test the Candlestick pattern that we had

523
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:55,159
and then we left so we have this

524
00:26:55,159 --> 00:26:57,840
structural pattern created and and we

525
00:26:57,840 --> 00:26:59,799
push above and then we create the

526
00:26:59,799 --> 00:27:02,159
Candlestick pattern again where could

527
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:06,480
price go and

528
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:10,640
retest if price usually has a retest on

529
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:14,000
the pattern where can price possibly go

530
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,880
to

531
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,919
retest what area did you see the pattern

532
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:21,240
happen in and not give a retest to it

533
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:24,200
that area becomes the unmitigated area

534
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,440
this portion here so Within this portion

535
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:30,960
here you might want to look

536
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:34,480
at you know um uh if there's any

537
00:27:34,480 --> 00:27:37,240
imbalances within here or anything and

538
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,799
maybe gauge that as where price could

539
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,640
potentially come back into tap and maybe

540
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,240
trade further if it wants to trade

541
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:47,880
further but when it gets there you want

542
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:51,640
to see the same pattern set up

543
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:55,799
here and that's if it crosses this and

544
00:27:55,799 --> 00:27:58,080
this because this could come back to the

545
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,120
imbalance a second time and then leave

546
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:01,919
and trade higher

547
00:28:01,919 --> 00:28:03,960
too but if it comes back to the

548
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:06,080
imbalance the second time it has to give

549
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:10,399
us the Candlestick pattern here and then

550
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:12,120
it trades

551
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:15,480
higher so we're always paying attention

552
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,720
to that and that's not necessarily just

553
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:20,320
a Candlestick pattern that you see it's

554
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:25,440
more so uh you know there's rules to it

555
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:26,760
you have the low put in you have the

556
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:28,679
high put in you put in another low then

557
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:30,519
you run the high then you come back to

558
00:28:30,519 --> 00:28:33,240
test it and you

559
00:28:33,240 --> 00:28:36,399
go so there's there's rules behind it

560
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:38,240
too it's not just oh when you see this

561
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:40,559
trade it looking like a Star Wars

562
00:28:40,559 --> 00:28:43,440
fighter jet or something you know which

563
00:28:43,440 --> 00:28:46,080
it it does look like a pretty cool you

564
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,679
know fighter

565
00:28:52,410 --> 00:28:54,679
[Music]

566
00:28:54,679 --> 00:28:57,360
jet you know but you're you're not just

567
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,919
trading it because you see that like

568
00:28:58,919 --> 00:29:01,240
there's rules within this as to why we

569
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,279
get involved in in a market like

570
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:08,880
this um slim what's up man

571
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:12,000
slim good see you man how are you

572
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:15,360
brother uh could you record Zoom calls

573
00:29:15,360 --> 00:29:17,640
and upload them to YouTube in the future

574
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:21,240
I was actually thinking about that um I

575
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:23,760
was I was really thinking about if I

576
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:25,679
should record the zoom and then put it

577
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:28,000
on YouTube but the truth is with the

578
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,840
sorry that that was pretty pretty loud

579
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,159
my bad with with the the truth is the

580
00:29:33,159 --> 00:29:36,799
zoom um there's like some Secret Sauce

581
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:40,159
in there like I don't know what what it

582
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:41,799
was last night I don't know if I was

583
00:29:41,799 --> 00:29:44,519
just tired and I just ended up in like a

584
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,240
very creative mood and we just started

585
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:50,039
like explaining everything you know

586
00:29:50,039 --> 00:29:52,200
throughout I have no idea what it was um

587
00:29:52,200 --> 00:29:54,480
so we tapped into this snd by the way

588
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,200
this snd was responsible for this

589
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:58,720
structural break to the top side um in

590
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:00,440
the intermediary structure so that's why

591
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:02,840
we tapped here and we had a push up um

592
00:30:02,840 --> 00:30:04,559
but we still want to monitor here we

593
00:30:04,559 --> 00:30:07,320
didn't run any lows here so this could

594
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:10,360
still continue to try to trade higher um

595
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:13,120
unless we violate one of the lows which

596
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:17,840
there is a a trend line you know forming

597
00:30:17,840 --> 00:30:20,840
here

598
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,399
um sorry I don't know why this thing

599
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:28,080
doesn't click sometimes look at me

600
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:29,120
talking about I don't know why it

601
00:30:29,120 --> 00:30:30,760
doesn't click sometimes it's me

602
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:32,559
obviously I'm not clicking

603
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,399
it I'm blaming it on in

604
00:30:35,399 --> 00:30:38,880
technology I'm on my Boomer

605
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:42,600
Behavior but um yeah no I uh I was

606
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:45,919
actually going to send it um a little

607
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:47,919
earlier but um you know I sent it pretty

608
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:50,440
late uh but the zooms there's so much

609
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:53,159
sauce in there like these guys on the

610
00:30:53,159 --> 00:30:55,159
zoom last night I'm sure they'll never

611
00:30:55,159 --> 00:30:56,880
ever need me for trading again if

612
00:30:56,880 --> 00:30:58,799
something ever happen to me they'll

613
00:30:58,799 --> 00:31:02,320
never a day in their life need any other

614
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:04,519
teaching and Direction other than what I

615
00:31:04,519 --> 00:31:07,200
taught them last night so there's

616
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,039
there's like some Secret Sauce in there

617
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:11,600
that that like people who I see that are

618
00:31:11,600 --> 00:31:14,360
very engaged and really really have like

619
00:31:14,360 --> 00:31:17,600
that strong desire to learn those are

620
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,080
the people who I want to share this with

621
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,320
like I I don't want to share this with

622
00:31:21,320 --> 00:31:25,519
people who who um you know will just not

623
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:28,320
not do white not do right by you know

624
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:29,600
like the stuff that I taught them

625
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,240
yesterday in the zoom they'll be

626
00:31:31,240 --> 00:31:33,360
millionaires

627
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:36,000
by probably sometime next year you know

628
00:31:36,000 --> 00:31:38,279
like or even the end of the year if if

629
00:31:38,279 --> 00:31:42,080
they continue to like you know um use it

630
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:44,440
in their trading they'll be millionaires

631
00:31:44,440 --> 00:31:45,200
another

632
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:48,519
time that's how great the info was but I

633
00:31:48,519 --> 00:31:50,600
just want to make sure that that people

634
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:53,159
really want it you know like I I wasted

635
00:31:53,159 --> 00:31:55,240
my time a lot when I first became

636
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:59,799
profitable I wasted so much time trying

637
00:31:59,799 --> 00:32:02,840
to get people who did not learn or or

638
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:06,440
know about Forex to understand it and I

639
00:32:06,440 --> 00:32:08,880
spent countless of hours I missed

640
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,039
birthdays I missed um you know just

641
00:32:12,039 --> 00:32:15,960
opportunities to do things and it was

642
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:18,399
because I was showing people things and

643
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:21,200
they weren't applying themselves or or

644
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:22,799
they would just they wouldn't study in

645
00:32:22,799 --> 00:32:24,360
their own time they would just wait

646
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:26,760
until they had access to me then they're

647
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:27,880
trying to learn and they're trying to

648
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,760
make money but it's like you got to

649
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,760
study this too you know because then you

650
00:32:31,760 --> 00:32:34,039
put most of the work on me you know one

651
00:32:34,039 --> 00:32:37,240
thing I love love love is is that um you

652
00:32:37,240 --> 00:32:39,159
know some of the people in the group

653
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:40,480
they're seeing the same things that I'm

654
00:32:40,480 --> 00:32:42,720
seeing and that encourages me to let me

655
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:44,559
know that you know like there's some

656
00:32:44,559 --> 00:32:47,880
growth there you know so um I was a

657
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,639
little discouraged early on where I I I

658
00:32:50,639 --> 00:32:53,120
had did one Zoom call some months back

659
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,840
and never did another another one again

660
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:58,120
because I was just a little discouraged

661
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,720
that people weren't applying themselves

662
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:02,120
people weren't hungry for it I mean this

663
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:03,760
is the right

664
00:33:03,760 --> 00:33:06,760
information not something that like oh

665
00:33:06,760 --> 00:33:08,480
study and learn you might be able to get

666
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,919
it no this is once you're exposed to it

667
00:33:12,919 --> 00:33:15,600
it's instantly going to click for you

668
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:17,559
and your mind is going to be blown

669
00:33:17,559 --> 00:33:19,720
forever that's the type of information

670
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,080
that I was teaching on the zoom last

671
00:33:21,080 --> 00:33:23,440
night and for the people that was up and

672
00:33:23,440 --> 00:33:25,000
they got it cool for the people that

673
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,440
couldn't I understand you know it was

674
00:33:26,440 --> 00:33:28,080
late at night too but we're going to

675
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:30,240
have future zooms as well that we

676
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,559
continue to you know like work within

677
00:33:34,559 --> 00:33:36,200
that that's same stuff that we were

678
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:38,039
teaching so I don't mind raching it

679
00:33:38,039 --> 00:33:40,360
again but you know we'll definitely have

680
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,840
those um in the

681
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:45,840
future uh let's see I am late for the

682
00:33:45,840 --> 00:33:47,480
top no no no you're you're not late for

683
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:50,120
the top down um it was just like a suo

684
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,480
top down little little fake top down not

685
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:54,639
really much because um we pushed up

686
00:33:54,639 --> 00:33:57,519
heavy into these areas um

687
00:33:57,519 --> 00:34:01,639
like very very heavy into these areas um

688
00:34:01,639 --> 00:34:04,919
we were uh gapping at some point up like

689
00:34:04,919 --> 00:34:07,440
look at look at these gaps within here

690
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,918
look at this Gap here we were down here

691
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:13,719
price closed

692
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:16,079
at

693
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:21,239
3180 price opened up at

694
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:24,599
3198 that's within a

695
00:34:24,599 --> 00:34:27,639
flash that it did that

696
00:34:27,639 --> 00:34:30,280
on this 10:00 candle and this is because

697
00:34:30,280 --> 00:34:32,800
um consumer sentiment news happened

698
00:34:32,800 --> 00:34:36,159
within a flash it pushed up like that

699
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,918
you know so um with these gaps we could

700
00:34:38,918 --> 00:34:40,839
also return back to them I didn't notice

701
00:34:40,839 --> 00:34:43,159
that this Gap was here until I just saw

702
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:46,800
um I saw it in between the indicator if

703
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,320
you look within here this is a lighter

704
00:34:48,320 --> 00:34:50,560
shade of green than this is so it kind

705
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:53,399
of exposes the gaps a little um since

706
00:34:53,399 --> 00:34:55,879
they're not necessarily the the same

707
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:58,079
green

708
00:34:58,079 --> 00:34:59,680
you see

709
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:02,720
that but there's gaps everywhere you

710
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,920
know within this that's why price often

711
00:35:04,920 --> 00:35:06,800
comes back down to these areas to test

712
00:35:06,800 --> 00:35:09,640
them and then leave um and this is a

713
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,560
pretty cool indicator as well guys I

714
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,480
keep vouching for this I keep telling

715
00:35:13,480 --> 00:35:17,920
you guys this is the imbalance indicator

716
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:19,440
there's somebody named travel and

717
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,000
something that created this you know he

718
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:24,720
was pretty spoton with it um kudos to

719
00:35:24,720 --> 00:35:26,480
that guy Travelin Trader or something

720
00:35:26,480 --> 00:35:27,440
like that

721
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,480
um I don't know if he's an actual Trader

722
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:32,040
or or anything like that but um travel

723
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:33,880
and Trader he created this pretty neat

724
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:36,200
indicator if you can't spot imbalances

725
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:39,599
by yourself you can utilize this but

726
00:35:39,599 --> 00:35:41,000
understand that this doesn't account for

727
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:43,320
all the imbalances because look we have

728
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:46,200
a huge imbalance below right

729
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:49,880
here and price the the indicator did not

730
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:51,640
even pick it up and that's a huge

731
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:55,640
imbalance in here so you know this would

732
00:35:55,640 --> 00:35:58,000
train your eye to see him imbalances but

733
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,480
again any and all indicators are lagging

734
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:03,480
it's always in past time that it's

735
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,680
letting you know whatever it is so I'm

736
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,400
completely against indicators you can

737
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:09,520
see everything on the indicator that

738
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,240
everything that shows you itself on an

739
00:36:11,240 --> 00:36:12,880
indicator can show you itself where

740
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,079
price so you could see where everything

741
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,359
is just based on you know the the price

742
00:36:20,359 --> 00:36:23,680
here if you want to find a a I don't

743
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:25,119
know like

744
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:27,680
a 200 day

745
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:29,599
you know like

746
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:33,560
um 200 day moving average like where

747
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,480
price has has been trading within that

748
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:39,240
so we know that within this time here

749
00:36:39,240 --> 00:36:42,000
let's take this area to this area we can

750
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,359
just take 200 days actually

751
00:36:46,359 --> 00:36:49,960
um let me see so it's about 200 days

752
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:53,400
here we know that our average was above

753
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,240
here so if we look down below where

754
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,680
price is is we know that we're

755
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,640
underneath the 200 moving average you

756
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:05,000
don't need an indicator to to like you

757
00:37:05,000 --> 00:37:07,240
know let you know this price can show

758
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:09,720
you this and when price shows you it

759
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:11,680
then you know that makes it all the more

760
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,720
powerful I didn't see this um this

761
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:17,640
weekly imbalance I mean monthly sorry I

762
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:20,319
didn't see this monthly imbalance here

763
00:37:20,319 --> 00:37:24,160
guys something to probably note um for

764
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:26,800
the future um because then this would

765
00:37:26,800 --> 00:37:29,000
indicate that we could potentially have

766
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:31,800
another leg down in the stock market and

767
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:34,880
that would essentially

768
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:39,119
be to here

769
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:41,760
29193 so we could potentially tap into

770
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,760
this area before flipping bullish the

771
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:45,960
market could have another leg down

772
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:49,520
potentially um in the in the long term

773
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,200
um so let's just something paying

774
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,480
attention to this is on a monthly chart

775
00:37:54,480 --> 00:37:57,079
um you know so maybe that's where we get

776
00:37:57,079 --> 00:38:01,599
our tap and then we push up to to come

777
00:38:01,599 --> 00:38:04,160
back to a higher Market maybe it's it's

778
00:38:04,160 --> 00:38:06,800
this that they're aiming for this

779
00:38:06,800 --> 00:38:08,800
imbalance um so yeah that's how you're

780
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:11,520
able to figure out the the moving

781
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,079
averages I don't need an indicator to

782
00:38:13,079 --> 00:38:17,200
show me that because I just took

783
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:21,040
the 200 days within the the um the

784
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:24,000
monthly and I was able to capture what

785
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:26,720
the indicator captures we're under the

786
00:38:26,720 --> 00:38:28,359
200 day moving

787
00:38:28,359 --> 00:38:30,480
average price can show you that you

788
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:31,720
don't need the indicator to show you

789
00:38:31,720 --> 00:38:33,560
that now granted the indicator probably

790
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:36,079
shows you it faster in terms of the

791
00:38:36,079 --> 00:38:38,200
averages like but the averages only

792
00:38:38,200 --> 00:38:40,599
matter really in stocks the moving

793
00:38:40,599 --> 00:38:43,760
averages do not matter in Forex at all

794
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,319
like at all I know people use them and I

795
00:38:46,319 --> 00:38:47,839
know people have these theories about

796
00:38:47,839 --> 00:38:50,319
them and cool great amazing if you use

797
00:38:50,319 --> 00:38:52,480
that that's that's cool if it works for

798
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:54,440
you that's fine too all of this is

799
00:38:54,440 --> 00:38:57,520
distribution up here so um this is

800
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:00,200
potentially um shorting back down to

801
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:02,599
some of these areas so um just be

802
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:06,560
mindful of that but yeah um you know you

803
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,119
you have let me move this indicator off

804
00:39:08,119 --> 00:39:09,520
before people come in here and be like

805
00:39:09,520 --> 00:39:11,520
you use an indicator you say you don't I

806
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:13,800
was just showing you guys that for you

807
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:17,680
know so you guys can see that um Dave

808
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:19,599
that is like give a man a fish and he

809
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:21,040
will eat a day but teach a man had a

810
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:25,079
fish and you would eat forever exactly

811
00:39:25,079 --> 00:39:28,720
exactly he should apply what I taught

812
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,480
him that that's exactly it like that

813
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,280
that's exactly what I was you know like

814
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:36,160
saying to people that like I could show

815
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,400
you where to take a trade from you guys

816
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,040
see that I call this stuff out all the

817
00:39:40,040 --> 00:39:42,040
time like I'm like oh might go here okay

818
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:43,880
here oh bounce up this imbalance here

819
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,440
that might run the high here oh just

820
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:47,400
like a equal equal High here oh that

821
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:49,040
could end up running a low you guys see

822
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:52,720
me do that all the time like within all

823
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,760
the past

824
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:56,440
videos I can tell you where to get in on

825
00:39:56,440 --> 00:39:58,079
trades I can go to the 15 minute and be

826
00:39:58,079 --> 00:39:59,680
like yeah you can take it from here and

827
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,760
then you can get out here cuz I do it

828
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:03,400
all the

829
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:05,200
time

830
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:08,160
but when I'm not here I want to travel

831
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:08,960
I'm

832
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:11,680
not if I'm not traveling with y'all I'm

833
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:13,319
not talking to y'all while I'm traveling

834
00:40:13,319 --> 00:40:15,280
no I'm kidding I'm I will sometimes be

835
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:16,800
in the group you know talking and

836
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:19,240
chatting um whenever I can or if I don't

837
00:40:19,240 --> 00:40:21,800
get in trouble but um you know other

838
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:23,160
than that like

839
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:27,400
I I you it's a no-brainer it's so so

840
00:40:27,400 --> 00:40:28,920
price came back into this area and

841
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,040
rejected out of this area this could be

842
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,280
a rejection that's sufficient enough to

843
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:37,040
um end up running the lows uh back into

844
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,160
some of these areas I know there's a

845
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:41,160
little imbalance within here so just

846
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:44,040
look out for that um and I pause

847
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,760
sometimes while I'm saying things just

848
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,400
just so you guys don't miss certain

849
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:49,280
things cuz I see it but that doesn't

850
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:51,119
necessarily mean you guys might be able

851
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:53,280
to see it um and look at this look at

852
00:40:53,280 --> 00:40:55,440
this imbalance to we tapped here and

853
00:40:55,440 --> 00:40:57,880
look at how far we came came up 63 Pips

854
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,520
just from this tiny imbalance within

855
00:41:00,520 --> 00:41:02,760
here you got the

856
00:41:02,760 --> 00:41:05,960
top you got the high put you got the the

857
00:41:05,960 --> 00:41:09,440
high ran you tap back into the area we

858
00:41:09,440 --> 00:41:11,680
disregard the Wix because that's

859
00:41:11,680 --> 00:41:13,560
manipulation and

860
00:41:13,560 --> 00:41:15,839
then we pull out of the

861
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:18,400
area so you're looking for the range of

862
00:41:18,400 --> 00:41:22,839
this high and not this low but the

863
00:41:22,839 --> 00:41:25,800
body that's only when price trades below

864
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,680
the wick to the left so you see how I

865
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:28,960
said we could be shorting out of this

866
00:41:28,960 --> 00:41:30,480
area I could have easily gave you guys

867
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:31,839
this trade and been like oh yeah we

868
00:41:31,839 --> 00:41:34,760
could short out of but if if you guys

869
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:37,280
don't know why it doesn't serve a

870
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,400
purpose and then you get this rejection

871
00:41:39,400 --> 00:41:40,920
here and you might be scared and be like

872
00:41:40,920 --> 00:41:43,280
oh you know price looks like it's not

873
00:41:43,280 --> 00:41:45,400
going down it could very well just be

874
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:47,359
this

875
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:50,800
here right here tap into this area this

876
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,599
was an unmitigated area when price took

877
00:41:52,599 --> 00:41:54,720
out this High here after putting in this

878
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,760
this low when it took out this High here

879
00:41:56,760 --> 00:41:59,119
and never trade it back inside so we got

880
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,800
the tap

881
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:04,960
here so now from the area that we were

882
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,560
talking about where there was the

883
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:08,800
possible rejection down to the area that

884
00:42:08,800 --> 00:42:12,079
it tapped this is 23 Pips in just 1

885
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:16,280
minute $20 in a minute $200 in a minute

886
00:42:16,280 --> 00:42:18,400
$2,000 in a minute whatever it is that

887
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,920
it means to you just understanding that

888
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:23,680
simple principle just got you what

889
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,160
people make an hour or

890
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:31,680
sometimes so I can I can show you guys

891
00:42:31,680 --> 00:42:34,200
trades yes like get in here get in there

892
00:42:34,200 --> 00:42:37,040
get if I showed you guys if I showed you

893
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:39,839
guys my trade history you wouldn't

894
00:42:39,839 --> 00:42:43,040
believe you wouldn't believe the the

895
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:46,079
amount of money that that like I come

896
00:42:46,079 --> 00:42:48,119
across in these markets both lose and

897
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:49,960
win well now it's not really losing

898
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:53,079
anymore so um it's like sparingly on

899
00:42:53,079 --> 00:42:56,319
trading but you know the both both both

900
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:58,319
lose and win if if you guys saw it it

901
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,720
would be like what you lost or you're

902
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:04,480
you're you're in draw down by like

903
00:43:04,480 --> 00:43:07,280
$5,000 and then immediately you're Plus

904
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:09,079
$220,000 in

905
00:43:09,079 --> 00:43:12,280
profit after $5,000 draw down and $5,000

906
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:13,559
draw on is

907
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,359
just like couple

908
00:43:17,359 --> 00:43:22,240
Pips it's like very very like you know

909
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:25,079
um high frequency in a

910
00:43:25,079 --> 00:43:27,200
sense

911
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,280
and I did see something with binary

912
00:43:29,280 --> 00:43:31,800
somebody told me about um binary like

913
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:34,200
synthetic indices um it looks like it

914
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:36,240
moves the same exact way so if you guys

915
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:37,760
learn this and that's something that

916
00:43:37,760 --> 00:43:40,359
your country um does or is interested in

917
00:43:40,359 --> 00:43:43,640
then you know like it's the same thing

918
00:43:43,640 --> 00:43:47,000
too we could be shorting down to um this

919
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:50,040
imbalance guys so just be mindful of

920
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:52,359
that even if we run certain highs and we

921
00:43:52,359 --> 00:43:54,440
pop back up sometimes that's just a

922
00:43:54,440 --> 00:43:56,200
retracement back into the area to

923
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:57,480
continue

924
00:43:57,480 --> 00:44:00,640
short so just be mindful of that um but

925
00:44:00,640 --> 00:44:01,800
this is what I want you guys to

926
00:44:01,800 --> 00:44:02,960
understand cuz the same way I talked to

927
00:44:02,960 --> 00:44:04,559
you guys about this and this and I

928
00:44:04,559 --> 00:44:05,839
talked to you guys about the Candlestick

929
00:44:05,839 --> 00:44:07,079
pattern here and I talked to you about

930
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,680
it here look it happened on the top side

931
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:12,040
too we get this Wick above we have this

932
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:14,920
area here and this area here and then we

933
00:44:14,920 --> 00:44:17,520
trade away but after we trade away what

934
00:44:17,520 --> 00:44:20,599
do we do we come back up and test the

935
00:44:20,599 --> 00:44:25,000
area and this is this is one that looks

936
00:44:25,000 --> 00:44:27,079
sideways

937
00:44:27,079 --> 00:44:31,040
we test the area come back into it test

938
00:44:31,040 --> 00:44:34,359
the area and we leave out of

939
00:44:34,359 --> 00:44:37,839
it so the actual move is up

940
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:40,319
here to take you

941
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:43,000
down but most people they're trading the

942
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:46,160
trend line break to come here look at

943
00:44:46,160 --> 00:44:48,720
the difference in value that that is

944
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:50,000
let's say you traded the trend line

945
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:52,440
break to here 23

946
00:44:52,440 --> 00:44:55,760
Pips but if you saw this happening and

947
00:44:55,760 --> 00:44:58,359
you you saw the test of this

948
00:44:58,359 --> 00:45:02,160
area that's 40

949
00:45:03,280 --> 00:45:06,760
44 so not only is this the discount area

950
00:45:06,760 --> 00:45:09,200
but you're discounting yourself down

951
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:14,000
here discounting your own trade down

952
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,520
here if you're not you know utilizing

953
00:45:17,520 --> 00:45:20,000
and and learning these

954
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,760
principles you're discounting yourself

955
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:26,599
there so I want you guys to expose

956
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:28,839
yourself to this over and over and over

957
00:45:28,839 --> 00:45:30,720
and over and the same way that I talk

958
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:32,400
about it over and over and over and over

959
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:34,480
and over and over again that's the same

960
00:45:34,480 --> 00:45:37,359
way that I want you guys to learn

961
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:40,280
this listen to it if you have to if you

962
00:45:40,280 --> 00:45:42,079
can't watch it if you have a long drive

963
00:45:42,079 --> 00:45:43,960
if whatever it is like like just listen

964
00:45:43,960 --> 00:45:47,359
to it then you know my voice my voice is

965
00:45:47,359 --> 00:45:49,680
sexy enough you know no I'm kidding but

966
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:52,000
just listen to it you know like you

967
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,800
don't always have to see it but just let

968
00:45:53,800 --> 00:45:57,280
it like like travel through your mind

969
00:45:57,280 --> 00:46:00,720
let it just wander in those those empty

970
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:02,880
places or or not empty I don't I'm not

971
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:05,520
calling people empty mind it but I'm I'm

972
00:46:05,520 --> 00:46:09,200
just saying like let let it like get

973
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:13,480
into into there you know like let it

974
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:17,640
just in random places it's coming up you

975
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,880
know like now when I hear I know um an

976
00:46:19,880 --> 00:46:21,920
America we have football here um that

977
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:24,520
they play it's a huge sport here um and

978
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:26,839

the SEC plays basketball or or football

981
00:46:32,559 --> 00:46:35,599
or whatever and then I'm like oh the SEC

982
00:46:35,599 --> 00:46:40,920
is a conference in football it's not a

983
00:46:40,920 --> 00:46:43,400
like it's not the governmental Authority

984
00:46:43,400 --> 00:46:46,440
for stocks or Securities and stuff you

985
00:46:46,440 --> 00:46:50,040
know so okay but sometimes you know I

986
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,160
get that you know

987
00:46:52,160 --> 00:46:56,280
so so yeah it's it like that that's how

988
00:46:56,280 --> 00:46:58,880
much it's going through my head I'm I'm

989
00:46:58,880 --> 00:47:01,680
sure that I have friends who are tired

990
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:05,400
of me just always talking about this all

991
00:47:05,400 --> 00:47:08,000
the time I'm more than sure that I have

992
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,400
friends who are tired of that like

993
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:14,520
absolutely like give it a break bro you

994
00:47:14,520 --> 00:47:19,000

995
00:47:19,000 --> 00:47:23,160
mind having it like like just go through

996
00:47:23,160 --> 00:47:25,920
your mind at all times I'm in church and

997
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:27,960
I'm thinking about this I'm in the

998
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:29,559
grocery store and I'm thinking about

999
00:47:29,559 --> 00:47:32,240
this I'm checking the market to see if

1000
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,200
it moved what it's

1001
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:38,440
closed that's how submerged I am into it

1002
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:40,800
it's closed and I'm still looking at it

1003
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,599
like you know let me look back and see

1004
00:47:42,599 --> 00:47:46,200
what happened you know during fomc okay

1005
00:47:46,200 --> 00:47:48,680
yeah that was it there and the market is

1006
00:47:48,680 --> 00:47:51,359
closed I can't do anything but I just

1007
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,480
have the obsessive nature of of loving

1008
00:47:54,480 --> 00:47:57,240
what happens with the market you know so

1009
00:47:57,240 --> 00:48:00,000
you guys definitely got to you know like

1010
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,280
get to that place because then you'll

1011
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,880
start to see things the way I see it

1012
00:48:04,880 --> 00:48:06,520
then you start to understand things the

1013
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,119
way I understand

1014
00:48:08,119 --> 00:48:12,400
it and that's when like it BEC so much

1015
00:48:12,400 --> 00:48:14,640
more powerful now I trade when I want to

1016
00:48:14,640 --> 00:48:17,200
trade I don't have to trade I trade when

1017
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:19,520
I want to trade I trade when I want to

1018
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:22,559
get something so the other day um not

1019
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,000
the other day like you know some time

1020
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:26,160
ago I went to Colombia um

1021
00:48:26,160 --> 00:48:28,280
and for me I was like you know if I want

1022
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:32,559
to go to Colombia make that money and go

1023
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:35,520
and then I I've successfully earned this

1024
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,359
might be pushing up above this high so

1025
00:48:37,359 --> 00:48:39,920
watch it I've successfully earned cuz

1026
00:48:39,920 --> 00:48:42,880
this is a tap back into um this pattern

1027
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:45,280
um i' I've successfully

1028
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:48,200
earned that trip to

1029
00:48:48,200 --> 00:48:51,760
Colombia so because I've earned that and

1030
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,119
because it's it it's something that I

1031
00:48:54,119 --> 00:48:56,720
worked for I'm going to enjoy the hell

1032
00:48:56,720 --> 00:48:59,040
out of and I'm going to do whatever it

1033
00:48:59,040 --> 00:49:01,839
is that I want and I'm G to even make

some money to to have as cash on a side

1035
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:08,240
and now I've funded my entire trip just

1036
00:49:08,240 --> 00:49:10,079
because I was able to go into the market

1037
00:49:10,079 --> 00:49:12,440
and work for it set it

1038
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:16,400

is not hard work yeah maybe the hard

1058
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:12,680

00:51:52,119 --> 00:51:54,359
zones right

1098
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:56,119
here

1099
00:51:56,119 --> 00:51:59,480
I told you it's the manipulation

1100
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:01,960
down and then we end up immediately

1101
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:05,319
running the high

1102
00:52:05,319 --> 00:52:07,920
here so we ran this

1103
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:10,480
low and then we ended up running the

1104
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,760
high so now we're looking for price to

1105
00:52:12,760 --> 00:52:16,599
come back within the range of the last

1106
00:52:16,599 --> 00:52:21,559
high and low which is around here

1107
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:26,680
but while we're looking for the range

1108
00:52:26,680 --> 00:52:29,880
most people might be looking at this snd

1109
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:34,720
here and then price what goes below

1110
00:52:34,839 --> 00:52:38,319
it but there's this long Wick that was

1111
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,000
left

1112
00:52:40,000 --> 00:52:45,960
behind this is the snd below the

1113
00:52:46,839 --> 00:52:49,640
wick so if you

1114
00:52:49,640 --> 00:52:52,839
take the

1115
00:52:53,160 --> 00:52:57,480
wick and you place this around on the

1116
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:01,640
wick where do you get a

1117
00:53:01,640 --> 00:53:05,040
top here and then you go that's where

1118
00:53:05,040 --> 00:53:08,240
the real move is in the hidden snd

1119
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:11,599
Zone but I have mentioned well not

1120
00:53:11,599 --> 00:53:13,760
mentioned I saw this on gold um I told

1121
00:53:13,760 --> 00:53:15,119
you there's there's like a couple

1122
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:17,319
streamers who stream I go in and try to

1123
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,440
find a trade um that they're they're

1124
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:23,760
trading um like a a trade on the

1125
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:25,319
commodity that they're trading or or

1126
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:28,480
whatever it is and um so I go to to find

1127
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:31,720
the trade and then I come back later on

1128
00:53:31,720 --> 00:53:33,799
to see if it played

1129
00:53:33,799 --> 00:53:37,680
out um look at this so I had this area

1130
00:53:37,680 --> 00:53:40,200
here um this is June

1131
00:53:40,200 --> 00:53:43,200
16th so this is a couple days ago I had

1132
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:45,319
this area here and I said price would

1133
00:53:45,319 --> 00:53:47,920
tap here and go up but that was after

1134
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:50,240
all of this imbalance was left behind so

1135
00:53:50,240 --> 00:53:52,760
price never came back here until not

1136
00:53:52,760 --> 00:53:54,559
never but it came back here later on

1137
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:55,920
over here

1138
00:53:55,920 --> 00:54:01,400
so look price Taps into the area right

1139
00:54:02,480 --> 00:54:05,040
here price Taps into the area here and

1140
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:07,040
look at where it pushes up all the way

1141
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:11,400
up here this is a $5 movement on

1142
00:54:11,400 --> 00:54:14,920
gold mind you these streamers are taking

1143
00:54:14,920 --> 00:54:18,079
a dollar or 10 Pips or or 50 um this is

1144
00:54:18,079 --> 00:54:21,119
a 50 pip movement that's 10 Pips is what

1145
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:23,839
they take so every morning I come in

1146
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:25,799
just to keep myself fresh I try to look

1147
00:54:25,799 --> 00:54:28,319
at other streamers find what it is that

1148
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,839
they're doing um and then look for a

1149
00:54:30,839 --> 00:54:33,920
trade within their area um so you have

1150
00:54:33,920 --> 00:54:36,079
this area right here but then you also

1151
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:39,400
have this imbalance here tiny imbalance

1152
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,400
on the inside of here so and and then

1153
00:54:42,400 --> 00:54:45,119
not just that this is the Candlestick

1154
00:54:45,119 --> 00:54:48,000
structure that we say we want to

1155
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:51,520
see not well the the structure this is

1156
00:54:51,520 --> 00:54:53,400
the structural shift that we want to see

1157
00:54:53,400 --> 00:54:55,720
the bullish flip on structure

1158
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,680
but then within this Candlestick

1159
00:54:58,680 --> 00:55:01,680
here did we ever get a test that came

1160
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:05,079
back into this area

1161
00:55:05,079 --> 00:55:06,880
no we

1162
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:10,640
didn't price left the area left this

1163
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,559
Candlestick structure behind or this

1164
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:15,280
this Candlestick pattern

1165
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,040
behind and we didn't get a test so this

1166
00:55:18,040 --> 00:55:20,960
becomes an area for later

1167
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,200
on this morning I went on the stream to

1168
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:27,119
you know just see what what these people

1169
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:29,480
were trading saw some people waiting on

1170
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:32,480
movements for gold and all that stuff on

1171
00:55:32,480 --> 00:55:35,000
the 30 minute or the hourly or the 4

1172
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:37,599
Hour and then they end up taking 10 Pips

1173
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:42,079
on gold 10 Pips alone cool you take 10

1174
00:55:42,079 --> 00:55:44,000
Pips on goal you know maybe that's

1175
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:46,640
enough for people you know fine but I

1176
00:55:46,640 --> 00:55:49,319
went and found a trade while they were

1177
00:55:49,319 --> 00:55:51,960
waiting for a setup and I got a tap on

1178
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:55,799
gold here from across the way all of

1179
00:55:55,799 --> 00:55:59,720
this here equal lows all being ran it's

1180
00:55:59,720 --> 00:56:02,440
it's liquidity below that if price

1181
00:56:02,440 --> 00:56:04,880
doesn't react here and give us a new

1182
00:56:04,880 --> 00:56:07,760
high then we're running the lows which

1183
00:56:07,760 --> 00:56:09,160
that's what we end up doing running the

1184
00:56:09,160 --> 00:56:11,079
lows so as we running the lows to come

1185
00:56:11,079 --> 00:56:14,520
back down here I said to myself okay we

1186
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:17,200
could tap into this area but this this

1187
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:19,119
this second line here is the imbalance

1188
00:56:19,119 --> 00:56:20,240
the the first line at the top is

1189
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:23,160
imbalance the second line here is the

1190
00:56:23,160 --> 00:56:26,280
actual Zone the Candlestick pattern that

1191
00:56:26,280 --> 00:56:27,960
I told you guys you know to pay

1192
00:56:27,960 --> 00:56:30,000
attention to and where we get retests

1193
00:56:30,000 --> 00:56:31,480
from

1194
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:34,559
sometimes uh so we tap into this area

1195
00:56:34,559 --> 00:56:38,240
and we push up look we push all the way

1196
00:56:38,240 --> 00:56:42,480
up $10 on gold this is a 100

1197
00:56:42,480 --> 00:56:47,319
Pips 100 Pips on gold

1198
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:51,359
in 10

1199
00:56:51,359 --> 00:56:55,319
minutes and this these people are uh on

1200
00:56:55,319 --> 00:56:57,880
the the 30 minute the hourly and only

1201
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:00,839
taking 10

1202
00:57:00,839 --> 00:57:04,200
Pips from the from the 30 minute I

1203
00:57:04,200 --> 00:57:06,680
should be getting a th000 Pips if I'm

1204
00:57:06,680 --> 00:57:09,079
trading that high

1205
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:11,200
up but this is what I'm talking about

1206
00:57:11,200 --> 00:57:14,119
with people who lack the ability to read

1207
00:57:14,119 --> 00:57:16,160
price because they

1208
00:57:16,160 --> 00:57:19,400
can't so we get a tap into the area back

1209
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:21,160
here because of that Candlestick

1210
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,799
structure that we saw where it wasn't

1211
00:57:23,799 --> 00:57:27,400
retested so look at what we have here

1212
00:57:27,400 --> 00:57:30,039
same thing on

1213
00:57:30,400 --> 00:57:33,440
gold uh not here let me actually use

1214
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:35,400
here look at

1215
00:57:35,400 --> 00:57:39,160
this low put in high put in low put in

1216
00:57:39,160 --> 00:57:41,359
We Run The High come back into the area

1217
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:45,920
we leave so even if even if I saw this

1218
00:57:45,920 --> 00:57:49,720
trade here and I got into this trade and

1219
00:57:49,720 --> 00:57:51,720
my stop loss was really low his stop

1220
00:57:51,720 --> 00:57:55,559
loss was like 30 Pips for for just 10

1221
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,480
gaining 10 Pips that's

1222
00:57:57,480 --> 00:58:02,160
crazy but now that I got this this entry

1223
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:04,119
here from the left

1224
00:58:04,119 --> 00:58:07,359
side this entry usually is the scalp

1225
00:58:07,359 --> 00:58:10,440
up so with this scalp up I mean it just

1226
00:58:10,440 --> 00:58:12,200
kept going I told you some scalps can

1227
00:58:12,200 --> 00:58:15,640
turn into long moves but if we noticed

1228
00:58:15,640 --> 00:58:18,960
this Candlestick pattern I mean this

1229
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:20,640
well the Candlestick pattern turned into

1230
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:24,240
a structural pattern once we saw that it

1231
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:27,280
turned into a structural pattern what

1232
00:58:27,280 --> 00:58:28,760
are we looking

1233
00:58:28,760 --> 00:58:32,079
for price to come back test within the

1234
00:58:32,079 --> 00:58:35,160
area and then

1235
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:38,520
leave and look this is where the second

1236
00:58:38,520 --> 00:58:40,960
entry

1237
00:58:41,880 --> 00:58:45,319
goes we get a test into the

1238
00:58:45,319 --> 00:58:47,799
area and then we

1239
00:58:47,799 --> 00:58:50,680
leave so now that's two trades but with

1240
00:58:50,680 --> 00:58:52,440
this trade if you were getting a test

1241
00:58:52,440 --> 00:58:56,119
into this area your stop are behind here

1242
00:58:56,119 --> 00:58:59,359
that's a lot of risk that's on the table

1243
00:58:59,359 --> 00:59:01,799
so we like

1244
00:59:01,799 --> 00:59:04,760
to the same flip that we see here we

1245
00:59:04,760 --> 00:59:07,000
like to see it at our

1246
00:59:07,000 --> 00:59:11,000
entry so now what do we have

1247
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:15,839
here and this is why it always gets so

1248
00:59:16,440 --> 00:59:20,359
Saucy we have this High put in right

1249
00:59:20,359 --> 00:59:23,760
here we have this low put in what do we

1250
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,960
have Wham a run of this high so what are

1251
00:59:26,960 --> 00:59:29,720
we doing coming back into the area and

1252
00:59:29,720 --> 00:59:32,400
this we came back into the area by 90%

1253
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,839
so that's why sometimes I'll use the

1254
00:59:33,839 --> 00:59:37,200
last candle of the area and then we come

1255
00:59:37,200 --> 00:59:41,280
out so guess where your entry

1256
00:59:41,280 --> 00:59:45,640
is your entry is here or if if if we're

1257
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:49,240
being honest about like where your entry

1258
00:59:49,240 --> 00:59:50,319
probably would have been it would have

1259
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,319
been the middle of this candle here

1260
00:59:53,319 --> 00:59:55,200
stops behind the zone don't care about

1261
00:59:55,200 --> 00:59:57,400
the wick because it's

1262
00:59:57,400 --> 01:00:00,799
manipulation and we're trading

1263
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:03,599
higher so now we go

1264
01:00:03,599 --> 01:00:05,280
from

1265
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:09,839
a 50 pip stop loss to a 7even pip stop

1266
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,839
loss on the second

1267
01:00:13,839 --> 01:00:16,039
entry and then since we know the

1268
01:00:16,039 --> 01:00:19,280
structure was created this way now we

1269
01:00:19,280 --> 01:00:21,559
know that we're running the high

1270
01:00:21,559 --> 01:00:25,720
too because the stru structure created

1271
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:27,440
the pattern as well so we get the

1272
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:29,839
pattern with the Candlestick we get the

1273
01:00:29,839 --> 01:00:33,359
pattern with the intermediary structure

1274
01:00:33,359 --> 01:00:35,319
but then we also end up getting the

1275
01:00:35,319 --> 01:00:38,599
pattern within the larger part of

1276
01:00:38,599 --> 01:00:41,319
structure so what you might have here is

1277
01:00:41,319 --> 01:00:43,640
gold run this

1278
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:47,160
High run this High come back within this

1279
01:00:47,160 --> 01:00:50,359
area and then leave out of the area so

1280
01:00:50,359 --> 01:00:52,720
then what you end up having here what

1281
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:55,119
you end up seeing is

1282
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,119
this run of this High to come back into

1283
01:00:57,119 --> 01:00:59,760
this area is only testing this

1284
01:00:59,760 --> 01:01:02,760
Candlestick setup here the structural

1285
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:04,200
setup remember I said we always get a

1286
01:01:04,200 --> 01:01:06,760
test into the area and we leave it's

1287
01:01:06,760 --> 01:01:09,640
only testing this area if it goes up

1288
01:01:09,640 --> 01:01:11,559
above this High comes back into this

1289
01:01:11,559 --> 01:01:14,359
area and then leaves so that's how we're

1290
01:01:14,359 --> 01:01:17,559
able to kind of see moves ahead of time

1291
01:01:17,559 --> 01:01:20,240
because now if it does

1292
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:25,599
this now we're looking at a larger setup

1293
01:01:25,599 --> 01:01:28,960
here that happened to let us know we

1294
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:31,880
could potentially be coming back up to

1295
01:01:31,880 --> 01:01:34,799
some of these highs up

1296
01:01:34,799 --> 01:01:36,680
here

1297
01:01:36,680 --> 01:01:39,240
whereas smart

1298
01:01:39,240 --> 01:01:42,960
money is going like this and they're

1299
01:01:42,960 --> 01:01:47,240
waiting for the trade to get up

1300
01:01:47,240 --> 01:01:51,119
there or they might be down in

1301
01:01:51,119 --> 01:01:56,319
here they could be down in here

1302
01:01:56,319 --> 01:01:58,240
but how do they get involved in here if

1303
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:00,839
price already tapped they look at this

1304
01:02:00,839 --> 01:02:03,359
and they go okay don't chase let's let

1305
01:02:03,359 --> 01:02:04,960
it get back up to this area because it

1306
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:06,839
looks like it's been

1307
01:02:06,839 --> 01:02:09,799
downtrending ever since we tapped into

1308
01:02:09,799 --> 01:02:12,720
here we came back up here we tapped back

1309
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:15,160
up here we tapped back up here and we

1310
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:17,559
could be coming back here to continue

1311
01:02:17,559 --> 01:02:20,480
making more lows because the real move

1312
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:23,359
could be down here or below

1313
01:02:23,359 --> 01:02:26,359
it

1314
01:02:26,520 --> 01:02:30,559
so this could be this entry here this

1315
01:02:30,559 --> 01:02:33,279
area here this was that Candlestick

1316
01:02:33,279 --> 01:02:34,799
pattern that we talked about that was

1317
01:02:34,799 --> 01:02:38,000
untested below

1318
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,520
here so that's why we can expect a

1319
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:43,119
rejection here and potentially continue

1320
01:02:43,119 --> 01:02:47,279
down to this area before going long and

1321
01:02:47,279 --> 01:02:49,839
potentially tapping up further into the

1322
01:02:49,839 --> 01:02:52,640
actual area here and then we can

1323
01:02:52,640 --> 01:02:55,039
continue short and crash through all of

1324
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,079
these here that could potentially happen

1325
01:02:58,079 --> 01:03:02,480
over the long term but within these

1326
01:03:02,480 --> 01:03:04,880
things that we're doing here we're

1327
01:03:04,880 --> 01:03:07,880
essentially just creating a story on

1328
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,400
each thing that's that's

1329
01:03:10,400 --> 01:03:13,440
touched so I hope that I hope that that

1330
01:03:13,440 --> 01:03:16,359
explanation helped some people

1331
01:03:16,359 --> 01:03:20,920
because that changed my trading

1332
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,279
forever that whole explanation that I

1333
01:03:23,279 --> 01:03:25,760
just gave about this on this other

1334
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:29,880
streamers trade changed my whole life

1335
01:03:29,880 --> 01:03:32,119
forever and this is just on the this is

1336
01:03:32,119 --> 01:03:35,119
on on the the five minute on

1337
01:03:35,119 --> 01:03:37,640
gold I told you I can trade anything it

1338
01:03:37,640 --> 01:03:40,039
doesn't matter what it is we went to the

1339
01:03:40,039 --> 01:03:43,440
Hong Kong exchange right here we could

1340
01:03:43,440 --> 01:03:46,279
potentially find a trade within here so

1341
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:49,160
price breaks up above this High we have

1342
01:03:49,160 --> 01:03:51,960
our little Candlestick pattern

1343
01:03:51,960 --> 01:03:54,880
here that we like to see

1344
01:03:54,880 --> 01:03:57,520
we also like to see the rules within

1345
01:03:57,520 --> 01:03:59,680
that

1346
01:03:59,680 --> 01:04:03,400
pattern so we

1347
01:04:03,400 --> 01:04:07,359
come here put in this low put in this

1348
01:04:07,359 --> 01:04:10,079
High we put in this low and then we run

1349
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:13,000
the high we tap back into the area and

1350
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:16,160
we go same rules same thing I'm trying

1351
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,200
to get you guys to see this all the

1352
01:04:18,200 --> 01:04:21,000
time all the freaking

1353
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,440
time because it happens everywhere it

1354
01:04:23,440 --> 01:04:25,039
happens at the top it happens at the

1355
01:04:25,039 --> 01:04:28,599
bottom this is a sign of a

1356
01:04:28,599 --> 01:04:31,480
reversal so this is actually how you

1357
01:04:31,480 --> 01:04:34,000
find the

1358
01:04:34,000 --> 01:04:37,000
reversal using utilizing this pattern

1359
01:04:37,000 --> 01:04:40,480
and if price drops out of this area and

1360
01:04:40,480 --> 01:04:44,559
comes back into this area around here it

1361
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:47,640
can just be retesting this overall

1362
01:04:47,640 --> 01:04:52,559
pattern to continue trading

1363
01:04:52,559 --> 01:04:55,799
higher so this becomes the area and what

1364
01:04:55,799 --> 01:04:58,440
makes this area important too if you

1365
01:04:58,440 --> 01:05:00,640
look to the

1366
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:04,520
left this area was responsible for the

1367
01:05:04,520 --> 01:05:07,160
structural

1368
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:11,359
break this

1369
01:05:11,359 --> 01:05:15,680
pattern so over time if this is trading

1370
01:05:15,680 --> 01:05:18,520
higher we could expect to tap

1371
01:05:18,520 --> 01:05:21,039
into this area

1372
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,599
here somewhere within this area here

1373
01:05:24,599 --> 01:05:28,119
and then price to trade higher but if we

1374
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:31,079
go below this area then we're

1375
01:05:31,079 --> 01:05:32,720
potentially looking

1376
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:35,160
to

1377
01:05:35,160 --> 01:05:38,119
short if we go below this area but we

1378
01:05:38,119 --> 01:05:40,400
would have to significantly go below the

1379
01:05:40,400 --> 01:05:42,200
area cuz

1380
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:46,200
this this is the last

1381
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,319
high and this is the last

1382
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:55,240
low so now

1383
01:05:55,240 --> 01:05:58,760
since we have this area here we just

1384
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:00,440
broke above

1385
01:06:00,440 --> 01:06:03,480
it this actually

1386
01:06:03,480 --> 01:06:07,319
becomes let me see hold on here here

1387
01:06:07,319 --> 01:06:12,279
here this validated this so now we're

1388
01:06:12,279 --> 01:06:15,480
we're within this range of this High

1389
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:18,799
here and this low here and look at how

1390
01:06:18,799 --> 01:06:23,000
many Pips are within this area from down

1391
01:06:23,000 --> 01:06:26,640
here to up

1392
01:06:27,160 --> 01:06:32,440
here so now the next the next cycle of

1393
01:06:32,440 --> 01:06:35,799
of the week or or the next couple

1394
01:06:35,799 --> 01:06:38,240
weeks price could do whatever it wants

1395
01:06:38,240 --> 01:06:41,559
in between here and all you have within

1396
01:06:41,559 --> 01:06:43,079
this area

1397
01:06:43,079 --> 01:06:45,880
here all you have within this area here

1398
01:06:45,880 --> 01:06:47,319
are losing

1399
01:06:47,319 --> 01:06:49,880
Traders that's all you have cuz this is

1400
01:06:49,880 --> 01:06:53,000
the area that they bought

1401
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:57,240
at and they bought you up and then sold

1402
01:06:57,240 --> 01:06:59,480
into this area and this is where they

1403
01:06:59,480 --> 01:07:01,720
started buying and then when they bought

1404
01:07:01,720 --> 01:07:04,359
up and broke this structure they came

1405
01:07:04,359 --> 01:07:08,319
back into it and sold into this

1406
01:07:08,319 --> 01:07:11,160
area so now you're within this range and

1407
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:14,640
people are just losing within

1408
01:07:14,640 --> 01:07:18,039
here because they're not seeing that now

1409
01:07:18,039 --> 01:07:20,400
this is the area they bought in and look

1410
01:07:20,400 --> 01:07:23,319
at how these lows are forming one low

1411
01:07:23,319 --> 01:07:25,599
here two low here three low here and

1412
01:07:25,599 --> 01:07:28,319
their higher highs building the

1413
01:07:28,319 --> 01:07:31,240
trend and they bought you back up into

1414
01:07:31,240 --> 01:07:32,960
here and made you think we were going to

1415
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:35,079
run the high and they immediately traded

1416
01:07:35,079 --> 01:07:38,599
below they they traded lower to here and

1417
01:07:38,599 --> 01:07:40,279
they just tested the area that they

1418
01:07:40,279 --> 01:07:42,799
bought up from and they pushed out of

1419
01:07:42,799 --> 01:07:46,839
the area and finally got us above here

1420
01:07:46,839 --> 01:07:50,520
so now this is an area that price can

1421
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,359
come back to within this lower part of

1422
01:07:53,359 --> 01:07:56,720
the area so if they end up running this

1423
01:07:56,720 --> 01:07:59,440
low that's okay if they want to trade

1424
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:01,880
higher they could come down here tap

1425
01:08:01,880 --> 01:08:03,799
into this area and then put in a new

1426
01:08:03,799 --> 01:08:07,279
high but if they don't they could come

1427
01:08:07,279 --> 01:08:09,160
down into let me actually move a lot of

1428
01:08:09,160 --> 01:08:12,160
this cuz I know it looks a little

1429
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:15,880
um distracting if they don't want to

1430
01:08:15,880 --> 01:08:19,120
come back into here they still have this

1431
01:08:19,120 --> 01:08:21,279
whole area down

1432
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:24,040
here that they could short back into and

1433
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:26,839
this is where the right move could be

1434
01:08:26,839 --> 01:08:29,880
at and then they continue up but that

1435
01:08:29,880 --> 01:08:34,439
doesn't mean that you can't get a

1436
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:38,158
reaction within this area you still can

1437
01:08:38,158 --> 01:08:41,279
get a reaction within this area but this

1438
01:08:41,279 --> 01:08:43,679
reaction within this area would come

1439
01:08:43,679 --> 01:08:46,799
down to here to bounce back up tap back

1440
01:08:46,799 --> 01:08:50,719
into this area before shorting below it

1441
01:08:50,719 --> 01:08:53,120
so the real short could be the retest of

1442
01:08:53,120 --> 01:08:54,560
this area

1443
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:56,960
and that's it's the same thing over and

1444
01:08:56,960 --> 01:08:59,439
over and I just explained this on gold

1445
01:08:59,439 --> 01:09:02,399
same explanation on on the Hong Kong

1446
01:09:02,399 --> 01:09:04,560
exchange I explained this on Japan

1447
01:09:04,560 --> 01:09:08,839
yesterday like every Market any Market

1448
01:09:08,839 --> 01:09:11,799
same thing happens same thing applies no

1449
01:09:11,799 --> 01:09:14,640
matter what Market you're trading in no

1450
01:09:14,640 --> 01:09:16,238
matter what market so I hope that

1451
01:09:16,238 --> 01:09:18,279
explanation you know helps you guys

1452
01:09:18,279 --> 01:09:23,198
happening so look at this this was on um

1453
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:26,439
EU I don't remember exactly what I was

1454
01:09:26,439 --> 01:09:29,000
um putting here but I said we can come

1455
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:33,080
down into this area down here we can go

1456
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:36,880
up above to this area here and then if

1457
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:40,279
we cross this High here we can come back

1458
01:09:40,279 --> 01:09:43,238
into the area and then leave so what

1459
01:09:43,238 --> 01:09:45,719
happened from across the way when we

1460
01:09:45,719 --> 01:09:49,520
crossed this High here we just crossed

1461
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:53,040
the high we tug back into the area but

1462
01:09:53,040 --> 01:09:54,840
look

1463
01:09:54,840 --> 01:09:58,000
Candlestick pattern

1464
01:09:58,080 --> 01:10:00,440
here this bullish

1465
01:10:00,440 --> 01:10:03,840
flip it takes us up and runs the high

1466
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:07,080
this bullish flipped flipped off of an

1467
01:10:07,080 --> 01:10:10,600
imbalance so we have price come back to

1468
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:13,040
an area for us and what do we get

1469
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:15,920
another bullish flip around here so we

1470
01:10:15,920 --> 01:10:18,640
go up but what do we notice as we're

1471
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:21,360
going up we notice I know that looks bad

1472
01:10:21,360 --> 01:10:23,920
right now guys but bear with me we

1473
01:10:23,920 --> 01:10:27,040
notice the larger structural

1474
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:29,800
flip so if we're coming out of the area

1475
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,719
and we see the structural

1476
01:10:32,719 --> 01:10:35,920
flip then we know that we're taking out

1477
01:10:35,920 --> 01:10:38,159
the

1478
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:41,199
high and that's where we're trading to a

1479
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,760
run of the

1480
01:10:44,239 --> 01:10:46,400
high and that's because these same

1481
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:48,360
principles this is on a 4X pair I don't

1482
01:10:48,360 --> 01:10:50,440
trade Forex pairs like to make money on

1483
01:10:50,440 --> 01:10:52,080
I don't trade Forex

1484
01:10:52,080 --> 01:10:55,440
pairs but analysis is analysis no matter

1485
01:10:55,440 --> 01:10:57,440
what Market you're trading in analysis

1486
01:10:57,440 --> 01:11:02,120
is analysis period there's there's no

1487
01:11:02,120 --> 01:11:07,080
other way other than analysis

1488
01:11:07,080 --> 01:11:10,520
pered analysis look this is a 5

1489
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,600
minute if you were looking at the price

1490
01:11:12,600 --> 01:11:14,679
on the 5 minute when it was here look at

1491
01:11:14,679 --> 01:11:17,199
this imbalance that it tapped into tap

1492
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:18,840
of the imbalance and what are we going

1493
01:11:18,840 --> 01:11:21,640
to run the low possibly and then what we

1494
01:11:21,640 --> 01:11:23,360
can get another tap into the imbalance

1495
01:11:23,360 --> 01:11:25,159
again

1496
01:11:25,159 --> 01:11:27,120
if price does come back up here before

1497
01:11:27,120 --> 01:11:29,480
trading down here if we get another tap

1498
01:11:29,480 --> 01:11:32,280
into the imbalance then that's a recipe

1499
01:11:32,280 --> 01:11:34,239
for the lows being ran and I already

1500
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:36,440
probably have these lows being ran

1501
01:11:36,440 --> 01:11:38,120
because there's some imbalance within

1502
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,800
here we already tapped into lower

1503
01:11:40,800 --> 01:11:43,520
portions of the area and traded above

1504
01:11:43,520 --> 01:11:45,679
but we didn't give another high so this

1505
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:47,920
is an equal high on a higher time frame

1506
01:11:47,920 --> 01:11:50,520
so the first thing we could expect is

1507
01:11:50,520 --> 01:11:53,280
this low being ran but we need to be

1508
01:11:53,280 --> 01:11:55,840
careful careful around this area because

1509
01:11:55,840 --> 01:11:57,840
look we have the Candlestick set up that

1510
01:11:57,840 --> 01:12:00,080
we usually like to see so this could

1511
01:12:00,080 --> 01:12:02,040
potentially just be coming back in to

1512
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:07,120
give the Third Leg of this setup and

1513
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:08,600
then trade

1514
01:12:08,600 --> 01:12:10,880
higher and it looks like a little cat

1515
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:12,960
paw bearish claw whatever it is you want

1516
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:14,960
to call it you know like make up your

1517
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,600
own name for it and run your mentorship

1518
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:19,159
teaching it you know but it's it's

1519
01:12:19,159 --> 01:12:22,120
essentially you know this same thing we

1520
01:12:22,120 --> 01:12:26,400
just don't have a um a mitigation to

1521
01:12:26,400 --> 01:12:27,679
this

1522
01:12:27,679 --> 01:12:30,679
area so because we don't have that this

1523
01:12:30,679 --> 01:12:33,560
is where price could be sending us down

1524
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:37,639
to tap into this area and then

1525
01:12:37,639 --> 01:12:39,880
potentially go long from here but it

1526
01:12:39,880 --> 01:12:41,679
could send us down from this imbalance

1527
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,480
or there's still this area above here

1528
01:12:44,480 --> 01:12:47,159
that it can come into so you see as said

1529
01:12:47,159 --> 01:12:49,679
price can tap into this imbalance here

1530
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:52,679
or it can trade higher into this area

1531
01:12:52,679 --> 01:12:55,080
and this is where the short could be the

1532
01:12:55,080 --> 01:12:57,800
long could be within this area or just

1533
01:12:57,800 --> 01:13:01,920
below this area right here I mean any

1534
01:13:01,920 --> 01:13:05,000
anywhere within this region really um

1535
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,639
because um when they talk about discount

1536
01:13:07,639 --> 01:13:10,600
and premium areas you look at this whole

1537
01:13:10,600 --> 01:13:12,880
move here from the bottom of this move

1538
01:13:12,880 --> 01:13:16,600
to top of this move here this is not a

1539
01:13:16,600 --> 01:13:20,760
discounted area for for them to continue

1540
01:13:20,760 --> 01:13:22,360
to put in new

1541
01:13:22,360 --> 01:13:25,760
highs this is the discounted area down

1542
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:28,080
here so you're more so looking for

1543
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:30,199
anywhere between the start of this area

1544
01:13:30,199 --> 01:13:32,800
which is the Run of this low and

1545
01:13:32,800 --> 01:13:34,880
potentially trading higher from some

1546
01:13:34,880 --> 01:13:39,920
area within here but not within this you

1547
01:13:39,920 --> 01:13:44,600
know so that could be um EU for for the

1548
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,960
day look we get another tap into this

1549
01:13:46,960 --> 01:13:49,400
imbalance and a rejection away again we

1550
01:13:49,400 --> 01:13:51,600
get a tap and a rejection that's fine

1551
01:13:51,600 --> 01:13:53,400
but we want to make sure that we get a

1552
01:13:53,400 --> 01:13:56,360
equal High somewhere along that line so

1553
01:13:56,360 --> 01:13:58,040
maybe we'll look on the one minute and

1554
01:13:58,040 --> 01:14:00,440
see if we get a equal high within here

1555
01:14:00,440 --> 01:14:02,360
and then the equal High could be taking

1556
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:05,600
us out of the area here and what retail

1557
01:14:05,600 --> 01:14:08,520
Traders are usually seeing within this

1558
01:14:08,520 --> 01:14:11,320
is that they're

1559
01:14:11,320 --> 01:14:13,320
seeing this

1560
01:14:13,320 --> 01:14:16,800
here and they go oh support term

1561
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:19,320
resistance and that's not the real way

1562
01:14:19,320 --> 01:14:21,080
to to

1563
01:14:21,080 --> 01:14:23,800
trade so we want to see that so we know

1564
01:14:23,800 --> 01:14:25,480
we were coming up to this but we want to

1565
01:14:25,480 --> 01:14:27,760
see that happen within this region or

1566
01:14:27,760 --> 01:14:29,639
else it could just trade higher within

1567
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:33,080
this area so we have rules to why we get

1568
01:14:33,080 --> 01:14:37,199
into trades and why we get out of Trades

1569
01:14:37,199 --> 01:14:39,600
and those rules stay consistent like

1570
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:41,199
even within here a lot of people

1571
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,679
probably don't see but there's a mini

1572
01:14:42,679 --> 01:14:48,800
imbalance within here right here and

1573
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:53,719
here yeah right here and here so you

1574
01:14:53,719 --> 01:14:56,440
could have price come to sweep these

1575
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,360
lows tap into this

1576
01:15:00,840 --> 01:15:04,120
imbalance or tap into this imbalance or

1577
01:15:04,120 --> 01:15:07,360
within this snd

1578
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:10,480
here and continue trading higher why

1579
01:15:10,480 --> 01:15:15,679
because it's it's below the premium

1580
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:19,199
level that you know Banks usually want

1581
01:15:19,199 --> 01:15:22,159
to trade from the imbalance is near the

1582
01:15:22,159 --> 01:15:24,679
premium level but the imbalances at the

1583
01:15:24,679 --> 01:15:27,040
lower level could end up being more

1584
01:15:27,040 --> 01:15:30,159
likely than this imbalance here because

1585
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,920
it's it's below the premium so the

1586
01:15:32,920 --> 01:15:36,320
premium really is this area here so if

1587
01:15:36,320 --> 01:15:39,400
we're expecting a tap back into this

1588
01:15:39,400 --> 01:15:42,520
area here you know this is like

1589
01:15:42,520 --> 01:15:46,360
75% down here is like 80% or so but this

1590
01:15:46,360 --> 01:15:49,840
is the premium of this move so that's

1591
01:15:49,840 --> 01:15:52,080
why you can expect a short down into the

1592
01:15:52,080 --> 01:15:53,960
premium but when you get to the premium

1593
01:15:53,960 --> 01:15:55,639
you want to see the same Candlestick

1594
01:15:55,639 --> 01:15:58,320
setup so we have this Candlestick setup

1595
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:00,920
here within this region but when we get

1596
01:16:00,920 --> 01:16:03,080
down here we also want to see this again

1597
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:05,679
within structure so we know that we're

1598
01:16:05,679 --> 01:16:08,320
possibly running the

1599
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:11,400
highs and that's you know essentially

1600
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,400
the the way that we trade here um if I

1601
01:16:13,400 --> 01:16:15,280
can take a minute and and tell you guys

1602
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:17,239
um that I'm not a financial advisor this

1603
01:16:17,239 --> 01:16:20,000
is not Financial advice this is just my

1604
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,560
perspective on the markets anything

1605
01:16:21,560 --> 01:16:24,159
taught within this channel is all always

1606
01:16:24,159 --> 01:16:26,960
based on my perspective and the

1607
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:28,440
education that I'm giving into the

1608
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:30,120
markets if you choose to take trades

1609
01:16:30,120 --> 01:16:32,320
within this then that's on you if you

1610
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:33,800
lose your money blow your account that's

1611
01:16:33,800 --> 01:16:35,719
on you has nothing to do with me I'm

1612
01:16:35,719 --> 01:16:37,719
just well with my teaching if you apply

1613
01:16:37,719 --> 01:16:38,920
your teaching you're not going to blow

1614
01:16:38,920 --> 01:16:40,840
your account but if you do blow your

1615
01:16:40,840 --> 01:16:43,280
account that's on you so we could

1616
01:16:43,280 --> 01:16:44,679
potentially be getting the Candlestick

1617
01:16:44,679 --> 01:16:45,840
pattern up

1618
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:49,520
here the pattern that we like to see we

1619
01:16:49,520 --> 01:16:52,639
could potentially get that up here so

1620
01:16:52,639 --> 01:16:54,159
you could even even have a run of this

1621
01:16:54,159 --> 01:16:56,960
low tap back into this area it shows us

1622
01:16:56,960 --> 01:16:58,719
the Candlestick pattern that we get and

1623
01:16:58,719 --> 01:17:01,320
then we actually get the short below

1624
01:17:01,320 --> 01:17:03,159
into

1625
01:17:03,159 --> 01:17:06,000
here and then that would only correlate

1626
01:17:06,000 --> 01:17:08,639
if the dollar is

1627
01:17:08,639 --> 01:17:10,960
longing if the dollar is longing then

1628
01:17:10,960 --> 01:17:14,440
you should get the short from

1629
01:17:14,440 --> 01:17:17,920
um from EU because obviously anything

1630
01:17:17,920 --> 01:17:20,159
within anything against the dollar if

1631
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:22,280
the dollar is belonging and going higher

1632
01:17:22,280 --> 01:17:23,719
then obviously

1633
01:17:23,719 --> 01:17:26,880
the the pairs that are against it are

1634
01:17:26,880 --> 01:17:29,800
going um down

1635
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:32,840
essentially so the both this this looks

1636
01:17:32,840 --> 01:17:35,719
like it's shorting EU looks like it's

1637
01:17:35,719 --> 01:17:38,600
shorting and then dxy looks like is

1638
01:17:38,600 --> 01:17:39,920
potentially

1639
01:17:39,920 --> 01:17:42,000
longing and where could it long to

1640
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:43,840
potentially here and get a rejection or

1641
01:17:43,840 --> 01:17:46,280
here and get a rejection uh but we put

1642
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:48,199
in another low so we want to make sure

1643
01:17:48,199 --> 01:17:51,639
that if we go above we don't want to run

1644
01:17:51,639 --> 01:17:55,080
this this high High sorry I don't know

1645
01:17:55,080 --> 01:17:57,080
why this doesn't click sometimes we end

1646
01:17:57,080 --> 01:17:59,760
up running this high and if we run this

1647
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:02,440
high and we expect price to come back

1648
01:18:02,440 --> 01:18:05,760
into the area within here why are we

1649
01:18:05,760 --> 01:18:07,360
expecting price to come back within the

1650
01:18:07,360 --> 01:18:09,360
area because then it'll show us our

1651
01:18:09,360 --> 01:18:12,760
Candlestick setup

1652
01:18:12,760 --> 01:18:15,480
here and then the dollar might long up

1653
01:18:15,480 --> 01:18:16,800
into

1654
01:18:16,800 --> 01:18:19,480
here and why are we longing into here

1655
01:18:19,480 --> 01:18:21,760
because obviously we're putting in lower

1656
01:18:21,760 --> 01:18:24,880
lows but this is our Candlestick setup

1657
01:18:24,880 --> 01:18:28,040
from the top side we did get a retest of

1658
01:18:28,040 --> 01:18:31,199
it right here so we could possibly even

1659
01:18:31,199 --> 01:18:33,400
look to go past it since we already got

1660
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:36,520
a retest of it when price traded out of

1661
01:18:36,520 --> 01:18:38,679
the

1662
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,040
area so this could essentially be

1663
01:18:41,040 --> 01:18:43,600
looking like a long to potentially go to

1664
01:18:43,600 --> 01:18:47,520
the high or take this High tap into this

1665
01:18:47,520 --> 01:18:49,880
High here and then the short may

1666
01:18:49,880 --> 01:18:53,120
actually be within sorry within this

1667
01:18:53,120 --> 01:18:54,320
region

1668
01:18:54,320 --> 01:18:59,080
here shorting from here

1669
01:18:59,199 --> 01:19:01,199
potentially shorting from here

1670
01:19:01,199 --> 01:19:02,840
potentially and this could be where the

1671
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:06,800
long is to take us

1672
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:09,360
higher and it's just the story that

1673
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:13,159
price has given us just utilizing these

1674
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:15,880
things and the reason why this area is

1675
01:19:15,880 --> 01:19:19,120
likely to short is because look I mean

1676
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:21,800
likely to to break up above is because

1677
01:19:21,800 --> 01:19:25,880
look this is trend line

1678
01:19:26,199 --> 01:19:28,560
liquidity whether it's this here whether

1679
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:32,320
it's this here it's all trend line

1680
01:19:32,320 --> 01:19:34,880
liquidity so we could expect price to

1681
01:19:34,880 --> 01:19:38,080
run all of it tap into this area reject

1682
01:19:38,080 --> 01:19:40,360
and come down but if we come straight

1683
01:19:40,360 --> 01:19:43,000
down from here then this could be where

1684
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:45,719
the long is running these equal Lowes

1685
01:19:45,719 --> 01:19:48,120
across here and then potentially taking

1686
01:19:48,120 --> 01:19:49,280
us back

1687
01:19:49,280 --> 01:19:52,480
up above this High here if we get down

1688
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:55,400
here first so all we essentially do is

1689
01:19:55,400 --> 01:19:59,159
just find ways to you know get involved

1690
01:19:59,159 --> 01:20:01,760
in the market whereas smart money

1691
01:20:01,760 --> 01:20:03,400
they're waiting for the market to come

1692
01:20:03,400 --> 01:20:05,880
to them and it's cool if you want to

1693
01:20:05,880 --> 01:20:07,920
wait for the market to come to you You'

1694
01:20:07,920 --> 01:20:10,440
just be waiting a pretty long time and

1695
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,800
that's kind of why I use the the trading

1696
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:15,440
techniques that I use because you know

1697
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:16,320
like

1698
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:20,719
it I'm I'm joining in on whatever it is

1699
01:20:20,719 --> 01:20:23,000
that the market is doing I'm joining in

1700
01:20:23,000 --> 01:20:27,080
on a continuation of the

1701
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,120
market so look at

1702
01:20:32,440 --> 01:20:36,120
this you have the short out of this

1703
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:39,159
area and where do we short

1704
01:20:39,159 --> 01:20:42,320
to there's an imbalance between

1705
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,080
here this is the imbalance that

1706
01:20:45,080 --> 01:20:48,679
originally sent price up so because this

1707
01:20:48,679 --> 01:20:51,600
imbalance was tapped already you could

1708
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:55,120
have a second tap to the area of this

1709
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:58,840
imbalance and then price trades up again

1710
01:20:58,840 --> 01:21:00,920
because remember I said the first tap on

1711
01:21:00,920 --> 01:21:03,440
the imbalance is usually the scalp up

1712
01:21:03,440 --> 01:21:05,840
and I mentioned this this scalp gave you

1713
01:21:05,840 --> 01:21:08,920
60 something Pips price returns back to

1714
01:21:08,920 --> 01:21:11,320
the imbalance again and now you're

1715
01:21:11,320 --> 01:21:13,840
looking for your move here I told you we

1716
01:21:13,840 --> 01:21:16,440
could be trading higher because this

1717
01:21:16,440 --> 01:21:19,800
area here I had said that I said watch

1718
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,239
it you know we could have a pullback

1719
01:21:21,239 --> 01:21:23,360
within this area and continue higher I

1720
01:21:23,360 --> 01:21:25,199
think we were like right here when when

1721
01:21:25,199 --> 01:21:26,320
I said

1722
01:21:26,320 --> 01:21:28,760
that because it was the tap the second

1723
01:21:28,760 --> 01:21:30,679
tap of the imbalance the double tap of

1724
01:21:30,679 --> 01:21:34,440
it and the double top of it traded us

1725
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,320
higher so now if price is going to shore

1726
01:21:37,320 --> 01:21:40,440
out of this area we know

1727
01:21:40,440 --> 01:21:42,840
that this

1728
01:21:42,840 --> 01:21:46,679
imbalance has done its job or price has

1729
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:50,159
done its job in filling this

1730
01:21:50,159 --> 01:21:52,800
imbalance so then we'd end up looking

1731
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:56,080
for it to potentially short below the

1732
01:21:56,080 --> 01:21:58,080
area of the

1733
01:21:58,080 --> 01:22:00,800
imbalance to potentially some area

1734
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,280
within

1735
01:22:03,719 --> 01:22:06,320
here because this is still an

1736
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:09,040
unmitigated area this is still an

1737
01:22:09,040 --> 01:22:12,040
untested area of this

1738
01:22:12,040 --> 01:22:15,440
setup and this is it happening on the

1739
01:22:15,440 --> 01:22:16,960
top

1740
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,480
side just like it happened here on the

1741
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:23,800
top side so this happens over and over

1742
01:22:23,800 --> 01:22:25,800
and over and over again and I try to

1743
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,520
teach people about it so they won't need

1744
01:22:28,520 --> 01:22:30,600
me because I'm going to be traveling I'm

1745
01:22:30,600 --> 01:22:32,199
going to be seeing the world I'm going

1746
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:34,320
to be in Aruba and Greece and all those

1747
01:22:34,320 --> 01:22:37,360
different places and you guys may I

1748
01:22:37,360 --> 01:22:39,000
might not have internet connection I

1749
01:22:39,000 --> 01:22:40,800
didn't have I barely had internet

1750
01:22:40,800 --> 01:22:42,719
connection in Colombia and I had the

1751
01:22:42,719 --> 01:22:45,199
audacity to be trading when I barely had

1752
01:22:45,199 --> 01:22:46,800
Connection in

1753
01:22:46,800 --> 01:22:50,520
Colombia barely anytime I left the hotel

1754
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:52,960
there was no connection at all no

1755
01:22:52,960 --> 01:22:54,040
internet

1756
01:22:54,040 --> 01:22:57,480
connection look at this you see this

1757
01:22:57,480 --> 01:22:59,840
this area that we like to see look at

1758
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:03,199
the test within this area we tap into

1759
01:23:03,199 --> 01:23:05,960
the area we test but this could just be

1760
01:23:05,960 --> 01:23:08,080
coming back up to tap

1761
01:23:08,080 --> 01:23:11,440
into this area here before leaving

1762
01:23:11,440 --> 01:23:13,120
because this would just be the retest

1763
01:23:13,120 --> 01:23:14,760
but usually the retest comes after the

1764
01:23:14,760 --> 01:23:17,600
run of the low so um we probably want to

1765
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:20,080
wait to see the run of the low first and

1766
01:23:20,080 --> 01:23:23,120
then potentially tap back up into and

1767
01:23:23,120 --> 01:23:25,560
then that's where the final short could

1768
01:23:25,560 --> 01:23:28,120
potentially

1769
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,320
come

1770
01:23:32,320 --> 01:23:36,159
yeah so this is pretty much different

1771
01:23:36,159 --> 01:23:38,880
than um it's just it's some of the same

1772
01:23:38,880 --> 01:23:42,080
rules within smart money but it's not

1773
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:44,120
all of that you know oh wait for the

1774
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:48,000
market to come to you you know don't

1775
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:50,320
overtrade if you don't find a setup

1776
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:52,000
today it's all right there's more

1777
01:23:52,000 --> 01:23:53,199
tomorrow

1778
01:23:53,199 --> 01:23:56,760
no smart money doesn't teach you that no

1779
01:23:56,760 --> 01:23:58,560
there's a setup every single day on

1780
01:23:58,560 --> 01:24:00,760
every single time frame and there's

1781
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:01,840
multiple

1782
01:24:01,840 --> 01:24:05,320
setups multiple setups I could find

1783
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:10,040
three four setups on an hourly time

1784
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,320
frame and watch it play out throughout

1785
01:24:12,320 --> 01:24:14,320
the rest of the day or potentially into

1786
01:24:14,320 --> 01:24:16,800
the next day there's no way that I

1787
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:18,400
should come into the market and not find

1788
01:24:18,400 --> 01:24:23,199
a setup absolutely no way absolutely you

1789
01:24:23,199 --> 01:24:25,719
see how I just said to you guys that oh

1790
01:24:25,719 --> 01:24:27,560
this could be a retest of this area but

1791
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:29,880
when I looked above I'm like oh wait no

1792
01:24:29,880 --> 01:24:33,320
we usually break the low first and after

1793
01:24:33,320 --> 01:24:35,320
we run the low then we get a retest of

1794
01:24:35,320 --> 01:24:37,120
the area and it

1795
01:24:37,120 --> 01:24:39,960
leaves so that was you know some

1796
01:24:39,960 --> 01:24:44,560
indication to stay out of a long going

1797
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,600
up and potentially ENT a short but where

1798
01:24:47,600 --> 01:24:50,360
to the run of the low and then we get a

1799
01:24:50,360 --> 01:24:52,480
retracement and look we just ran this

1800
01:24:52,480 --> 01:24:54,480
low here and now we're getting a

1801
01:24:54,480 --> 01:24:56,400
retracement back up potentially to here

1802
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:00,040
potentially back to the the area

1803
01:25:00,040 --> 01:25:02,920
above but we ran that low and where did

1804
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:05,840
we find support on the run of the low

1805
01:25:05,840 --> 01:25:07,760
right here

1806
01:25:07,760 --> 01:25:10,480
OB forget the wick that's manipulation

1807
01:25:10,480 --> 01:25:14,560
don't care about that tap into the

1808
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,520
OB I'm telling you guys I I I do this

1809
01:25:17,520 --> 01:25:19,960
every day to show you guys that like

1810
01:25:19,960 --> 01:25:21,840
there's nothing better than look at this

1811
01:25:21,840 --> 01:25:23,480
look at this up

1812
01:25:23,480 --> 01:25:27,719
this come on man this is just a scalp 22

1813
01:25:27,719 --> 01:25:31,360
Pips up just noticing this area not

1814
01:25:31,360 --> 01:25:33,800
paying attention to the wick taking this

1815
01:25:33,800 --> 01:25:36,400
area having price tap in and go look

1816
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:38,400
price already tapped in here and gave us

1817
01:25:38,400 --> 01:25:41,239
another high so that means that this

1818
01:25:41,239 --> 01:25:44,679
area is an invalidated area to begin

1819
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:47,000
with it's just that just because it's

1820
01:25:47,000 --> 01:25:48,440
invalidated doesn't mean that it can't

1821
01:25:48,440 --> 01:25:49,520
give you a

1822
01:25:49,520 --> 01:25:51,920
reaction so this area is an invalidated

1823
01:25:51,920 --> 01:25:53,920
area we're not expecting this area to

1824
01:25:53,920 --> 01:25:56,239
give us higher highs because it already

1825
01:25:56,239 --> 01:25:59,159
did we tapped into this area here and it

1826
01:25:59,159 --> 01:26:02,000
gave us the higher

1827
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:07,760
High I mean unless this is a double

1828
01:26:07,760 --> 01:26:10,840
bottom to the area who knows but you

1829
01:26:10,840 --> 01:26:14,400
know nonetheless the scalp up is usually

1830
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:15,360
the

1831
01:26:15,360 --> 01:26:19,119
first entry that I

1832
01:26:19,760 --> 01:26:22,920
get we scalp up

1833
01:26:22,920 --> 01:26:25,639
20 something Pips come back into the

1834
01:26:25,639 --> 01:26:28,040
area to potentially test the area look

1835
01:26:28,040 --> 01:26:29,840
we got the test right

1836
01:26:29,840 --> 01:26:32,480
here and we could potentially go back up

1837
01:26:32,480 --> 01:26:34,800
to

1838
01:26:43,119 --> 01:26:46,000
here but this when you begin to learn

1839
01:26:46,000 --> 01:26:49,800
these things and you begin to like

1840
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:53,920
familiarize yourself with this stuff

1841
01:26:53,920 --> 01:26:57,159
then like it all starts to come to you

1842
01:26:57,159 --> 01:26:58,960
just as fast this is on the one minute

1843
01:26:58,960 --> 01:27:01,360
in the New York session most of the

1844
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:02,760
times I'm talking and I look up at the

1845
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:05,760
time and I'm an hour and a half in look

1846
01:27:05,760 --> 01:27:08,920
1:49 an hour and 49 minutes hour and a

1847
01:27:08,920 --> 01:27:11,239
half in because price is moving so fast

1848
01:27:11,239 --> 01:27:13,920
and I'm trying to you know teach while

1849
01:27:13,920 --> 01:27:16,480
helping you guys adjust to to everything

1850
01:27:16,480 --> 01:27:19,600
within the market and then you end

1851
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:22,280
up you know with like beautiful stuff

1852
01:27:22,280 --> 01:27:24,840
like this because there are reasons

1853
01:27:24,840 --> 01:27:26,320
behind

1854
01:27:26,320 --> 01:27:29,719
it so we talked about shorting from here

1855
01:27:29,719 --> 01:27:33,480
to potentially the imbalance here but

1856
01:27:33,480 --> 01:27:35,080
then there was this imbalance within

1857
01:27:35,080 --> 01:27:37,960
here that price was just double tapping

1858
01:27:37,960 --> 01:27:41,480
and gave us another push up and within

1859
01:27:41,480 --> 01:27:43,520
here there could be an imbalance further

1860
01:27:43,520 --> 01:27:45,880
below here I'm not saying that there's

1861
01:27:45,880 --> 01:27:48,960
not there could be because on a higher

1862
01:27:48,960 --> 01:27:50,719
time frame it could be like a 5 minute

1863
01:27:50,719 --> 01:27:53,000
imbalance that price is tapping

1864
01:27:53,000 --> 01:27:55,040
into

1865
01:27:55,040 --> 01:27:58,639
um so no this is not a 5 minute maybe a

1866
01:27:58,639 --> 01:28:00,880
3

1867
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:03,639
minute little tiny one here within the 3

1868
01:28:03,639 --> 01:28:06,320
minute that's the double tap uh no two

1869
01:28:06,320 --> 01:28:08,440
minute let me see the 3

1870
01:28:08,440 --> 01:28:11,880
minute no nothing there so so this is

1871
01:28:11,880 --> 01:28:15,800
definitely like within this area this is

1872
01:28:15,800 --> 01:28:18,840
definitely um an imbalance in a on a

1873
01:28:18,840 --> 01:28:20,800
lower time frame than

1874
01:28:20,800 --> 01:28:23,880
this but because of how far down it came

1875
01:28:23,880 --> 01:28:25,880
below it but then we still saw our

1876
01:28:25,880 --> 01:28:28,280
Candlestick setup and we still got a

1877
01:28:28,280 --> 01:28:30,719
test of the Candlestick setup which I

1878
01:28:30,719 --> 01:28:32,960
mentioned that we look like we're

1879
01:28:32,960 --> 01:28:35,000
testing the Candlestick

1880
01:28:35,000 --> 01:28:37,159
setup I mentioned it right here when we

1881
01:28:37,159 --> 01:28:39,679
were Downing this area so then we ended

1882
01:28:39,679 --> 01:28:41,360
up trading

1883
01:28:41,360 --> 01:28:44,159
higher after tapping into this balance

1884
01:28:44,159 --> 01:28:46,800
and after testing the Candlestick

1885
01:28:46,800 --> 01:28:50,040
setup so we don't have the same thing

1886
01:28:50,040 --> 01:28:54,080
here you see how I just mention mention

1887
01:28:54,080 --> 01:28:57,639
that that this was a retest of the area

1888
01:28:57,639 --> 01:29:00,440
and it was just taking us back up to

1889
01:29:00,440 --> 01:29:04,560
here if anybody took that

1890
01:29:05,080 --> 01:29:09,560
trade 32 Pips up just within 3 minutes

1891
01:29:09,560 --> 01:29:12,600
that I just mentioned this so that's why

1892
01:29:12,600 --> 01:29:14,560
I'm trying to get you guys to understand

1893
01:29:14,560 --> 01:29:17,880
the like how powerful the the techniques

1894
01:29:17,880 --> 01:29:20,840
are like how how important it is to

1895
01:29:20,840 --> 01:29:23,760
grasp what I'm saying because it's

1896
01:29:23,760 --> 01:29:26,040
happening right in front of us over and

1897
01:29:26,040 --> 01:29:28,520
over and over and over and over and over

1898
01:29:28,520 --> 01:29:30,199
and over and over and over and over

1899
01:29:30,199 --> 01:29:35,080
again it's happening over and over

1900
01:29:35,080 --> 01:29:38,639
again and if if if you bunker down on

1901
01:29:38,639 --> 01:29:40,119
learning

1902
01:29:40,119 --> 01:29:43,280
this man you will never need me again

1903
01:29:43,280 --> 01:29:45,400

again to trade ever you will never come

1905
01:29:48,440 --> 01:29:50,520

that um watch watch this this High here

1921
01:30:22,080 --> 01:30:23,639
we could potentially come above this

1922
01:30:23,639 --> 01:30:26,040
high and tap back in before trading

1923
01:30:26,040 --> 01:30:28,239
higher just because this possible setup

1924
01:30:28,239 --> 01:30:32,520

1932
01:30:49,520 --> 01:30:53,960
Downs those are killers absolute bangers

1933
01:30:53,960 --> 01:30:55,719
and then we just teach the algorithm

see you don't have to like the video

1938
01:31:06,440 --> 01:31:08,000
that's okay you can dislike it if you

1939
01:31:08,000 --> 01:31:10,800
want to but also share this with other

1940
01:31:10,800 --> 01:31:13,679
people that you know who trade so they

1941
01:31:13,679 --> 01:31:16,880
can get the real deal for the stuff that

1942
01:31:16,880 --> 01:31:19,199
that like you have to pay thousands of

1943
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:21,560
dollars for this information I know that

1944
01:31:21,560 --> 01:31:24,119
this information is thousands of

1945
01:31:24,119 --> 01:31:28,800
dollars and I became Robin

1946
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,719
Hood so I'm actually teaching this let

1947
01:31:31,719 --> 01:31:34,880
me actually save this template

1948
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:37,880
um

1949
01:31:40,080 --> 01:31:42,880
uh since she wanted to tell me that I

1950
01:31:42,880 --> 01:31:44,480
should use a gray background I'm just

1951
01:31:44,480 --> 01:31:46,840
going to save it at that but I'm Robin

1952
01:31:46,840 --> 01:31:48,400
Hood guys this is why let me show you

1953
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:50,119
guys my chart

1954
01:31:50,119 --> 01:31:53,880
actually uh is this it here this is why

1955
01:31:53,880 --> 01:31:56,199
I initially started with let me take

1956
01:31:56,199 --> 01:31:58,639
this no gap on candle indicator off I

1957
01:31:58,639 --> 01:32:00,880
initially started with black and green

1958
01:32:00,880 --> 01:32:03,679
candles when I started first trading

1959
01:32:03,679 --> 01:32:05,520
because I considered myself Robin Hood

1960
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:08,239
I'm taking all of the

1961
01:32:08,239 --> 01:32:11,440
information that's put out there in

1962
01:32:11,440 --> 01:32:15,000
these secret groups that nobody wants to

1963
01:32:15,000 --> 01:32:16,760
really share that information with the

1964
01:32:16,760 --> 01:32:19,520
public and I'm like hey you know who do

1965
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,080
I know I could pass away next week

1966
01:32:23,080 --> 01:32:25,320
this could help people help generations

1967
01:32:25,320 --> 01:32:26,320
of

1968
01:32:26,320 --> 01:32:28,960
people why should it be all hoarded for

1969
01:32:28,960 --> 01:32:31,400
those who could afford it doesn't make

1970
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:33,920
sense so this is how my chart was

1971
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:36,360
actually um in in the beginning because

1972
01:32:36,360 --> 01:32:39,400
it signified being Robin Hood I have a

1973
01:32:39,400 --> 01:32:42,480
um a it's interesting I have a tattoo

1974
01:32:42,480 --> 01:32:46,320
here um on my uh bicep here uh you see

1975
01:32:46,320 --> 01:32:49,679
that guys it's

1976
01:32:49,679 --> 01:32:53,119
uh right here it's an

1977
01:32:53,119 --> 01:32:56,400
arrow I love arrows what they represent

1978
01:32:56,400 --> 01:33:01,000
I love that Robin Hood used arrows to

1979
01:33:01,000 --> 01:33:04,239
you know like do what he

1980
01:33:04,239 --> 01:33:07,800
did and for me I like I embody that

1981
01:33:07,800 --> 01:33:09,600
that's the person that I am and it's not

1982
01:33:09,600 --> 01:33:11,320
the Robin Hood that turned off the buy

1983
01:33:11,320 --> 01:33:14,119
button with GameStop it's like the real

1984
01:33:14,119 --> 01:33:17,920
Robin Hood so um yeah I I

1985
01:33:17,920 --> 01:33:20,560
essentially you know believe

1986
01:33:20,560 --> 01:33:23,360
wholeheartedly in and if people are poor

1987
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,560
they're not poor because they want to be

1988
01:33:25,560 --> 01:33:28,280
poor some people are born

1989
01:33:28,280 --> 01:33:31,040
poor like it's not your fault if you're

1990
01:33:31,040 --> 01:33:33,639
born poor but as Bill Gates says it's

1991
01:33:33,639 --> 01:33:36,280
your for it's your fault if you die poor

1992
01:33:36,280 --> 01:33:38,679
and for some people it's we have

1993
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:40,000
exceptions to that we're not saying

1994
01:33:40,000 --> 01:33:42,360
everybody who dies poor is it's their

1995
01:33:42,360 --> 01:33:44,800
fault because the truth is there are

1996
01:33:44,800 --> 01:33:46,760
some things that happens within

1997
01:33:46,760 --> 01:33:49,520
government within laws that that you

1998
01:33:49,520 --> 01:33:51,199
know essentially causes people to be

1999
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:54,000
liquid liid at times that's what this

2000
01:33:54,000 --> 01:33:55,719
whole recession is this recession is

2001
01:33:55,719 --> 01:33:57,320
liquidity all the money that they gave

2002
01:33:57,320 --> 01:33:59,440
out within the stimulus they recouping

2003
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:02,639
that back up liquidity but for me I just

2004
01:34:02,639 --> 01:34:05,119
want to be able to help people uh hi bro

2005
01:34:05,119 --> 01:34:08,239
one quick question um isn't that a

2006
01:34:08,239 --> 01:34:09,960
rising wedge or that

2007
01:34:09,960 --> 01:34:16,719
doesn't oh uh so so yeah um I yeah this

2008
01:34:16,719 --> 01:34:20,119
this could be um a rising wedge

2009
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:22,280
uh here

2010
01:34:22,280 --> 01:34:24,880
uh within

2011
01:34:26,840 --> 01:34:28,679
here

2012
01:34:28,679 --> 01:34:31,920
yeah this could be a ryen wedge um

2013
01:34:31,920 --> 01:34:35,119
pattern within here um and a breakout of

2014
01:34:35,119 --> 01:34:38,760
it a retest of it and trade away um but

2015
01:34:38,760 --> 01:34:41,920
I don't I don't trade um retail Concepts

2016
01:34:41,920 --> 01:34:44,719
um I more so just trade the algorithm um

2017
01:34:44,719 --> 01:34:46,920
of the market so in terms of retail

2018
01:34:46,920 --> 01:34:48,440
Concepts again some of them could be

2019
01:34:48,440 --> 01:34:50,320
profitable look it's falling out of the

2020
01:34:50,320 --> 01:34:52,199
wedge yeah you know like it it could

2021
01:34:52,199 --> 01:34:55,560
totally be a a rise and wedge um but the

2022
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:59,040
retail concepts are only like 30% of the

2023
01:34:59,040 --> 01:35:02,280
time that they actually Rising wedge RIS

2024
01:35:02,280 --> 01:35:03,960
and triangle whatever you want to put it

2025
01:35:03,960 --> 01:35:06,360
they're like 30 40% of the time they

2026
01:35:06,360 --> 01:35:10,080
work you know like it's not um it's not

2027
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,000
consistent so I really don't use them I

2028
01:35:12,000 --> 01:35:15,080
just utilize structure with

2029
01:35:15,080 --> 01:35:17,639
um you know like supply and demand zones

2030
01:35:17,639 --> 01:35:18,920
or

2031
01:35:18,920 --> 01:35:21,960
imbalances and and that's it um

2032
01:35:21,960 --> 01:35:24,360
you know just the way price forms how it

2033
01:35:24,360 --> 01:35:27,719
moves uh but yeah if if you like if if

2034
01:35:27,719 --> 01:35:29,360
this is you know what you're seeing and

2035
01:35:29,360 --> 01:35:32,719
you're trading from this this would be

2036
01:35:32,719 --> 01:35:36,080
you know trade to Short from yes because

2037
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,880
you see the distribution happening at

2038
01:35:37,880 --> 01:35:41,440
the top side you are aware of the break

2039
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:43,239
of the trend line but you're also aware

2040
01:35:43,239 --> 01:35:45,520
of the break in structure below not

2041
01:35:45,520 --> 01:35:47,000
really a break of structure but the run

2042
01:35:47,000 --> 01:35:49,719
of the low you get a retest within the

2043
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:51,880
area within our candle Candlestick

2044
01:35:51,880 --> 01:35:53,520
pattern that we usually teach here on

2045
01:35:53,520 --> 01:35:57,199
the channel we get the retest of the

2046
01:35:57,199 --> 01:36:00,360
area within this and then we ended up we

2047
01:36:00,360 --> 01:36:03,239
end up shorting out of the area so we

2048
01:36:03,239 --> 01:36:05,560
could potentially shortpass this snd

2049
01:36:05,560 --> 01:36:08,480
because this already gave us a higher

2050
01:36:08,480 --> 01:36:12,119
high above this High here so we're not

2051
01:36:12,119 --> 01:36:15,159
necessarily looking to um utilize this

2052
01:36:15,159 --> 01:36:19,560
anymore for entries to go longer because

2053
01:36:19,560 --> 01:36:22,440
this is already invalidated so we would

2054
01:36:22,440 --> 01:36:24,239
essentially be looking for a short pass

2055
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:27,239
the area potentially into this area you

2056
01:36:27,239 --> 01:36:29,239
might get a bounce from this area to

2057
01:36:29,239 --> 01:36:31,960
come back into here and then you can get

2058
01:36:31,960 --> 01:36:34,920
another short into this imbalance price

2059
01:36:34,920 --> 01:36:36,840
hasn't tapped into this imbalance as of

2060
01:36:36,840 --> 01:36:39,239
yet so you can get a double bottom on

2061
01:36:39,239 --> 01:36:41,199
this imbalance and potentially come back

2062
01:36:41,199 --> 01:36:43,560
up to whatever area that could be up

2063
01:36:43,560 --> 01:36:46,960
here and then you can get another short

2064
01:36:46,960 --> 01:36:49,960
down to run these lows into potentially

2065
01:36:49,960 --> 01:36:52,080
like an imbalance within here here to

2066
01:36:52,080 --> 01:36:54,960
make price come back up maybe test this

2067
01:36:54,960 --> 01:36:57,600
area here before shorting again and

2068
01:36:57,600 --> 01:37:00,199
that's how the overall trend can be

2069
01:37:00,199 --> 01:37:04,000
built and on the higher time frame this

2070
01:37:04,000 --> 01:37:07,239
just ends up being the Candlestick

2071
01:37:07,239 --> 01:37:09,920
pattern that we like to see but just

2072
01:37:09,920 --> 01:37:12,040
from a higher time frame that's how the

2073
01:37:12,040 --> 01:37:15,239
trend could potentially roll out so um

2074
01:37:15,239 --> 01:37:17,960
yeah you you could utilize um you know

2075
01:37:17,960 --> 01:37:20,119
the the retail trading patterns as I say

2076
01:37:20,119 --> 01:37:21,760
but they just have to

2077
01:37:21,760 --> 01:37:23,840
you know essentially make sense in terms

2078
01:37:23,840 --> 01:37:26,159
of structure if they don't make sense in

2079
01:37:26,159 --> 01:37:28,679
terms of structure then that could be a

2080
01:37:28,679 --> 01:37:31,080
recipe for disaster cuz you could end up

2081
01:37:31,080 --> 01:37:34,560
just having it come down to here you

2082
01:37:34,560 --> 01:37:38,560
know out of the wedge and then

2083
01:37:38,560 --> 01:37:43,560
potentially trading higher after um

2084
01:37:43,560 --> 01:37:47,159
sorry after the the top of this area but

2085
01:37:47,159 --> 01:37:49,159
again we're not necessarily looking for

2086
01:37:49,159 --> 01:37:52,280
the top of this area to give us another

2087
01:37:52,280 --> 01:37:55,239
high but there is a possibility that

2088
01:37:55,239 --> 01:37:57,760
down here if price gets to it it could

2089
01:37:57,760 --> 01:38:00,400
potentially put in another high for us

2090
01:38:00,400 --> 01:38:02,760
depending on if it's within an imbalance

2091
01:38:02,760 --> 01:38:04,840
maybe might give us a double bottom

2092
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:07,159
within an imbalance to come and run this

2093
01:38:07,159 --> 01:38:11,119
trend line high right

2094
01:38:12,800 --> 01:38:16,920
here run this trend line

2095
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:21,520
High you know run the liquidity of up

2096
01:38:21,520 --> 01:38:24,639
here and then finally give you the short

2097
01:38:24,639 --> 01:38:27,080
um and it could it could end up looking

2098
01:38:27,080 --> 01:38:31,000
like a manipulation Wick above here and

2099
01:38:31,000 --> 01:38:33,840
then you know tap back into the

2100
01:38:33,840 --> 01:38:37,199
area so that's just something that that

2101
01:38:37,199 --> 01:38:38,840
you want to consider and pay attention

2102
01:38:38,840 --> 01:38:42,280
to as you're in the trade so you're not

2103
01:38:42,280 --> 01:38:45,440
caught up with um you know just

2104
01:38:45,440 --> 01:38:47,639
like the you don't see the structural

2105
01:38:47,639 --> 01:38:51,320
shift in price which you know show shows

2106
01:38:51,320 --> 01:38:53,320
you that you shouldn't be shorting down

2107
01:38:53,320 --> 01:38:55,360
into this area but because you saw the

2108
01:38:55,360 --> 01:38:57,440
wedge pattern the wedge pattern just

2109
01:38:57,440 --> 01:38:59,639
might make you think that you know it's

2110
01:38:59,639 --> 01:39:02,480
safe to take it down through cuz I think

2111
01:39:02,480 --> 01:39:04,880
they use the back of the pattern like

2112
01:39:04,880 --> 01:39:07,719
here so they would say okay if if the

2113
01:39:07,719 --> 01:39:10,920
back of the pattern is 86 Pips then when

2114
01:39:10,920 --> 01:39:13,239
price falls out of the wedge you could

2115
01:39:13,239 --> 01:39:17,679
expect it to go 86 Pips down which it

2116
01:39:17,679 --> 01:39:20,760
could technically go you know 86 Pips to

2117
01:39:20,760 --> 01:39:23,719
this balance and maybe trade higher that

2118
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:26,320
could be right for the wedge itself but

2119
01:39:26,320 --> 01:39:28,719
if you see a shift anywhere within this

2120
01:39:28,719 --> 01:39:33,520
area here then you might miss that shift

2121
01:39:33,520 --> 01:39:35,280
where it could take price

2122
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:38,520
higher and now it comes back and hits

2123
01:39:38,520 --> 01:39:41,760
your stop loss so um the the wedges are

2124
01:39:41,760 --> 01:39:45,840
cool you know um you know but that

2125
01:39:45,840 --> 01:39:47,960
that's essentially um why I just use

2126
01:39:47,960 --> 01:39:52,679
structure and um just uh zones really um

2127
01:39:52,679 --> 01:39:53,719
great thanks for your answer you're

2128
01:39:53,719 --> 01:39:57,000
welcome brother um thank you Dave for

2129
01:39:57,000 --> 01:39:58,840
your dedication and time for us all

2130
01:39:58,840 --> 01:40:00,599
appreciate this slots you're welcome man

2131
01:40:00,599 --> 01:40:03,199
you're welcome God bless you too man I I

2132
01:40:03,199 --> 01:40:05,639
do it because I just you know I want to

2133
01:40:05,639 --> 01:40:08,520
see people do well you know and I want

2134
01:40:08,520 --> 01:40:10,080
to see people have an advantage the

2135
01:40:10,080 --> 01:40:12,280
retail Trader we don't have an advantage

2136
01:40:12,280 --> 01:40:14,040
already in the market because we don't

2137
01:40:14,040 --> 01:40:16,480
have the money but if we had the

2138
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:18,760
information that could give us the

2139
01:40:18,760 --> 01:40:21,480
advantage we need so it's just the

2140
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:24,000
information solely that that we're

2141
01:40:24,000 --> 01:40:27,119
looking to to get because the money's in

2142
01:40:27,119 --> 01:40:30,800
the information the money is not in the

2143
01:40:30,800 --> 01:40:33,560
actual Market or the product it's in the

2144
01:40:33,560 --> 01:40:35,520
information behind the market cuz if the

2145
01:40:35,520 --> 01:40:37,639
stock market crashes guess what I'm

2146
01:40:37,639 --> 01:40:39,840
trading in Japan I'm trading in Hong

2147
01:40:39,840 --> 01:40:42,080
Kong I'm trading in London's exchange

2148
01:40:42,080 --> 01:40:44,159
trading in Spain's exchange or Europe's

2149
01:40:44,159 --> 01:40:46,520
exchange you have so many other markets

2150
01:40:46,520 --> 01:40:48,880
to trade in if this Market crashes

2151
01:40:48,880 --> 01:40:50,480
you're the crypto Market that's a global

2152
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:53,040
market Trad in you know like you you

2153
01:40:53,040 --> 01:40:54,880
don't really need to limit yourself to

2154
01:40:54,880 --> 01:40:56,599
to One Market but if you learn the

2155
01:40:56,599 --> 01:40:58,080
analysis of it

2156
01:40:58,080 --> 01:41:00,880
now every Market you want to participate

2157
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,960
in you're in and doing well in so yeah

2158
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:07,320
oh um hey bro great content so what is

2159
01:41:07,320 --> 01:41:09,040
the lowest time frame you would consider

2160
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,639
a break because sometimes if we say H1

2161
01:41:13,639 --> 01:41:17,239
it might be too late to enter because uh

2162
01:41:17,239 --> 01:41:20,639
the 30 minute break was actually enough

2163
01:41:20,639 --> 01:41:21,679
um

2164
01:41:21,679 --> 01:41:24,840
so a break of of structure for me

2165
01:41:24,840 --> 01:41:28,880
usually is um the body closure below the

2166
01:41:28,880 --> 01:41:30,159
last

2167
01:41:30,159 --> 01:41:32,440
low So

2168
01:41:32,440 --> 01:41:36,320
within this area

2169
01:41:37,599 --> 01:41:41,199
here we have this low this high this low

2170
01:41:41,199 --> 01:41:44,040
we have this High we have this low we

2171
01:41:44,040 --> 01:41:46,880
just put in a high so now we're working

2172
01:41:46,880 --> 01:41:52,840
within the range of the last High

2173
01:41:53,119 --> 01:41:56,920
and the last low here we're working

2174
01:41:56,920 --> 01:42:00,239
within the range of that until we end up

2175
01:42:00,239 --> 01:42:03,599
putting in another low and then a body

2176
01:42:03,599 --> 01:42:07,599
closure above of a high if the body

2177
01:42:07,599 --> 01:42:14,280
doesn't close above then this low is not

2178
01:42:14,280 --> 01:42:17,520
validated so when this low is

2179
01:42:17,520 --> 01:42:19,920
invalidated we could immediately come

2180
01:42:19,920 --> 01:42:21,560
crashing through the this low if we're

2181
01:42:21,560 --> 01:42:23,920
shorting because this is not considered

2182
01:42:23,920 --> 01:42:27,760
a low on the the overall like structure

2183
01:42:27,760 --> 01:42:30,400
the larger structure so this is probably

2184
01:42:30,400 --> 01:42:32,320
like a 5 minute structure that I just

2185
01:42:32,320 --> 01:42:34,440
drew out or maybe even 15 I'm not too

2186
01:42:34,440 --> 01:42:37,920
sure but um it's 15 5 15 minute swing

2187
01:42:37,920 --> 01:42:41,960
points but um this is um and This is

2188
01:42:41,960 --> 01:42:45,560
Swing point on a trend I mean um this is

2189
01:42:45,560 --> 01:42:49,639
the the smaller Trend within that so you

2190
01:42:49,639 --> 01:42:52,400
have this High and this last low and

2191
01:42:52,400 --> 01:42:56,119
price just broke the structure to the

2192
01:42:56,119 --> 01:43:00,199
top side here so now not only do we have

2193
01:43:00,199 --> 01:43:02,239
this and this

2194
01:43:02,239 --> 01:43:07,719
area we also have this High put in so

2195
01:43:07,719 --> 01:43:10,599
that means that within this whole area

2196
01:43:10,599 --> 01:43:14,199
here price can do whatever it wants so

2197
01:43:14,199 --> 01:43:17,080
we would need a structural break out of

2198
01:43:17,080 --> 01:43:17,840
the

2199
01:43:17,840 --> 01:43:21,679
area in order to give us some indication

2200
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:23,800
that price is going bearish so once we

2201
01:43:23,800 --> 01:43:25,960
get the structural break out of the area

2202
01:43:25,960 --> 01:43:28,440
we might get a retest back into this

2203
01:43:28,440 --> 01:43:30,880
area and then

2204
01:43:30,880 --> 01:43:33,880
leave but the structural break usually

2205
01:43:33,880 --> 01:43:38,840
is with the body closure um below a

2206
01:43:38,840 --> 01:43:42,599
particular swing point so if you're

2207
01:43:42,599 --> 01:43:45,080
asking for for the one hour you're

2208
01:43:45,080 --> 01:43:48,800
looking at potentially um a Break um

2209
01:43:48,800 --> 01:43:52,159
sorry let me

2210
01:43:52,159 --> 01:43:55,760
you're looking at a break on the one

2211
01:43:58,159 --> 01:44:03,400
hour this this hourly here right here

2212
01:44:03,400 --> 01:44:07,960
this is not a this coming up above this

2213
01:44:07,960 --> 01:44:10,560
this is not a structural break this Wick

2214
01:44:10,560 --> 01:44:13,159
here unless let me actually zoom in so I

2215
01:44:13,159 --> 01:44:14,679
could show you guys a little better I

2216
01:44:14,679 --> 01:44:16,719
keep forgetting that you guys don't see

2217
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:20,080
the screen as large as I do so with this

2218
01:44:20,080 --> 01:44:23,480
here this is not a structural break

2219
01:44:23,480 --> 01:44:26,800
right here this Wick coming above this

2220
01:44:26,800 --> 01:44:30,199
high this is not a structural break the

2221
01:44:30,199 --> 01:44:32,440
structural break is the body closing

2222
01:44:32,440 --> 01:44:37,199
above the high so if this body right

2223
01:44:37,199 --> 01:44:40,599
here if this body here closed Above This

2224
01:44:40,599 --> 01:44:44,760
high now that validates this

2225
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:46,599
low

2226
01:44:46,599 --> 01:44:49,119
here because you got the body closure

2227
01:44:49,119 --> 01:44:53,280
Above So now now we're looking to come

2228
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:56,760
between this area

2229
01:44:56,760 --> 01:45:00,040
here and this low here we're looking for

2230
01:45:00,040 --> 01:45:03,080
an area within here that price could

2231
01:45:03,080 --> 01:45:06,639
potentially trade to and then give us

2232
01:45:06,639 --> 01:45:10,679
another high to break this so what we're

2233
01:45:10,679 --> 01:45:13,360
actually looking for is a tap within

2234
01:45:13,360 --> 01:45:16,040
some area within here I always talk

2235
01:45:16,040 --> 01:45:17,920
about the imbalances because as I

2236
01:45:17,920 --> 01:45:20,000
mentioned they're stronger areas than

2237
01:45:20,000 --> 01:45:22,840
the SN D zones are but if you want to

2238
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:26,760
use the snd zones you can um or the the

2239
01:45:26,760 --> 01:45:28,440
supply candle the demand candle if you

2240
01:45:28,440 --> 01:45:30,560
want to use that you can but usually

2241
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,119
what you want to see when price comes

2242
01:45:32,119 --> 01:45:34,400
back into this area to let you know that

2243
01:45:34,400 --> 01:45:36,400
we could potentially be running a high

2244
01:45:36,400 --> 01:45:38,560
is let me delete all of this real quick

2245
01:45:38,560 --> 01:45:40,960
to show

2246
01:45:41,239 --> 01:45:44,320
you usually we want to see this

2247
01:45:44,320 --> 01:45:47,080
here the Candlestick pattern that we

2248
01:45:47,080 --> 01:45:50,840
usually talk about we want to see this

2249
01:45:50,840 --> 01:45:55,760
within an area of Interest so this here

2250
01:45:55,760 --> 01:45:56,920
is a

2251
01:45:56,920 --> 01:46:02,119
fractal this area here is actually a

2252
01:46:02,119 --> 01:46:04,840
supply uh I mean sorry a demand area on

2253
01:46:04,840 --> 01:46:07,760
a lower time frame so let me select this

2254
01:46:07,760 --> 01:46:12,159
area here and actually show you on a

2255
01:46:12,159 --> 01:46:15,639
lower time frame what it looks

2256
01:46:16,840 --> 01:46:19,960
like you take this and you take this

2257
01:46:19,960 --> 01:46:22,040
price came below it which is fine

2258
01:46:22,040 --> 01:46:24,880
because we're still within the range of

2259
01:46:24,880 --> 01:46:27,760
this so for the range of this we

2260
01:46:27,760 --> 01:46:30,960
essentially have to be below the

2261
01:46:30,960 --> 01:46:34,360
50% below the 50% in order to get a

2262
01:46:34,360 --> 01:46:36,520
sufficient enough reaction to take us up

2263
01:46:36,520 --> 01:46:38,159
and put in another

2264
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:42,920
high so we get the 50% of this move we

2265
01:46:42,920 --> 01:46:45,760
have to be below the 50% of the

2266
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:49,159
move we get into the below the 50% but

2267
01:46:49,159 --> 01:46:52,119
then we spring up up out of the

2268
01:46:52,119 --> 01:46:56,080
area after we spring up out of this area

2269
01:46:56,080 --> 01:47:00,639
you look at the lows and highs being put

2270
01:47:00,639 --> 01:47:05,280
in low here we get a run of this High

2271
01:47:05,280 --> 01:47:06,440
the lower

2272
01:47:06,440 --> 01:47:08,960
high or the higher low whatever we get a

2273
01:47:08,960 --> 01:47:11,760
low of it we get a run of it so after we

2274
01:47:11,760 --> 01:47:15,040
run it we come back into the area of the

2275
01:47:15,040 --> 01:47:17,960
range that was ran and we

2276
01:47:17,960 --> 01:47:20,960
leave and that's all within

2277
01:47:20,960 --> 01:47:23,000
our structural break we found a

2278
01:47:23,000 --> 01:47:24,800
structural break so we're expecting it

2279
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:27,679
to happen within here because the break

2280
01:47:27,679 --> 01:47:30,199
of structure to the top side we're not

2281
01:47:30,199 --> 01:47:34,000
expecting it to run below this at all

2282
01:47:34,000 --> 01:47:36,440
because we put in a new high which means

2283
01:47:36,440 --> 01:47:38,280
that this low

2284
01:47:38,280 --> 01:47:41,159
becomes the protected

2285
01:47:41,159 --> 01:47:45,599
low here that becomes the protected low

2286
01:47:45,599 --> 01:47:47,040
somebody just ring my doorbell so hold

2287
01:47:47,040 --> 01:47:49,320
on real quick it's probably a delivery

2288
01:47:49,320 --> 01:47:52,320
man

2289
01:48:19,239 --> 01:48:21,920
FedEx

2290
01:48:21,920 --> 01:48:24,880
yeah so this becomes a protected low

2291
01:48:24,880 --> 01:48:27,560
here oh my gosh did I check the the

2292
01:48:27,560 --> 01:48:30,199
music oh my gosh this stream is probably

2293
01:48:30,199 --> 01:48:33,800
going to get taken down I'm so upset uh

2294
01:48:33,800 --> 01:48:37,199
the if the music is not um uh no

2295
01:48:37,199 --> 01:48:41,719
copyright then um often times you end up

2296
01:48:41,719 --> 01:48:44,040
um getting the copyright hit on the

2297
01:48:44,040 --> 01:48:47,920
stream damn it come on I'm so upset

2298
01:48:47,920 --> 01:48:51,560
about that cuz the then they they end up

2299
01:48:51,560 --> 01:48:53,560
if it's a song that's that's blocked in

2300
01:48:53,560 --> 01:48:56,000
C a certain number of countries then

2301
01:48:56,000 --> 01:48:57,639
they end up just blocking the whole

2302
01:48:57,639 --> 01:49:00,679
stream all together so um that's the

2303
01:49:00,679 --> 01:49:02,800
sucky part but yeah um as I was

2304
01:49:02,800 --> 01:49:05,159
explaining the oh you get it now okay

2305
01:49:05,159 --> 01:49:07,320
great great I'm glad you get

2306
01:49:07,320 --> 01:49:10,480
it I I go off into like talking but I

2307
01:49:10,480 --> 01:49:13,280
want to like explain the whole thing um

2308
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:16,560
for you guys so um yeah that that's

2309
01:49:16,560 --> 01:49:18,159
that's how it'll look and on a lower

2310
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:19,840
time frame when you get down to this

2311
01:49:19,840 --> 01:49:23,719
area are here now all you do is I mean

2312
01:49:23,719 --> 01:49:25,520
obviously if you ask me about time frame

2313
01:49:25,520 --> 01:49:28,400
you probably know um about this too but

2314
01:49:28,400 --> 01:49:31,159
let me just you know show you on a lower

2315
01:49:31,159 --> 01:49:32,159
time

2316
01:49:32,159 --> 01:49:35,280
frame if you see the top within your

2317
01:49:35,280 --> 01:49:37,840
area now you just want to see it happen

2318
01:49:37,840 --> 01:49:43,560
again and look it happens again

2319
01:49:45,119 --> 01:49:48,440
here same thing same exact thing put in

2320
01:49:48,440 --> 01:49:50,719
a high put in a low right run the high

2321
01:49:50,719 --> 01:49:52,560
come back into the area

2322
01:49:52,560 --> 01:49:55,280
leave and now you see that

2323
01:49:55,280 --> 01:49:59,360
happen within your your hourly area and

2324
01:49:59,360 --> 01:50:02,159
now all you do is

2325
01:50:02,159 --> 01:50:06,119
just take the hourly

2326
01:50:07,760 --> 01:50:11,400
move and even though price comes back

2327
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:14,320
to um this area

2328
01:50:14,320 --> 01:50:17,639
here price comes back to this area here

2329
01:50:17,639 --> 01:50:20,880
I mentioned um to to the guys on the

2330
01:50:20,880 --> 01:50:26,400
stream I mention that often times

2331
01:50:26,679 --> 01:50:31,639
when when you have this area put

2332
01:50:31,679 --> 01:50:34,560
in when you have this area put in you

2333
01:50:34,560 --> 01:50:37,199
usually get a test of the area before

2334
01:50:37,199 --> 01:50:38,560
trading

2335
01:50:38,560 --> 01:50:41,040
higher and that's even on a higher time

2336
01:50:41,040 --> 01:50:43,400
frame you get a test of the area before

2337
01:50:43,400 --> 01:50:45,159
trading

2338
01:50:45,159 --> 01:50:48,000
higher or or a reaction off the area

2339
01:50:48,000 --> 01:50:49,679
maybe you may not put in a high like

2340
01:50:49,679 --> 01:50:51,560
look right right here there wasn't a

2341
01:50:51,560 --> 01:50:53,599
high put in but you did get a reaction

2342
01:50:53,599 --> 01:50:56,599
from it so now I mentioned that you can

2343
01:50:56,599 --> 01:50:59,159
just take a

2344
01:50:59,960 --> 01:51:02,920
square Saucy man you can take a square

2345
01:51:02,920 --> 01:51:05,679
and put it around this area and now look

2346
01:51:05,679 --> 01:51:09,040
you get a tap of the square in this area

2347
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:11,679
so you get a tap into the 50% just as if

2348
01:51:11,679 --> 01:51:15,880
it's a a um demand Zone because it is a

2349
01:51:15,880 --> 01:51:18,199
demand Zone look at

2350
01:51:18,199 --> 01:51:21,119
this on the higher time time frame this

2351
01:51:21,119 --> 01:51:23,800
is one

2352
01:51:27,159 --> 01:51:31,400
candle here but maybe it's on the

2353
01:51:31,400 --> 01:51:36,000
15 here this one dogee

2354
01:51:36,000 --> 01:51:40,400
candle where we tap here and we

2355
01:51:40,400 --> 01:51:43,040
go but we're just finding the demand

2356
01:51:43,040 --> 01:51:45,079
zones as they're made and then we're

2357
01:51:45,079 --> 01:51:47,199
seeing the mitigation of it but because

2358
01:51:47,199 --> 01:51:49,239
time is fractal you see everything all

2359
01:51:49,239 --> 01:51:51,320

behind the person because I tell people

2392
01:53:48,800 --> 01:53:51,079
all the time you want to make sure that

2393
01:53:51,079 --> 01:53:53,119
you're sharing information with people

2394
01:53:53,119 --> 01:53:55,560
who they are actually like the

2395
01:53:55,560 --> 01:53:57,480
information is verified it's real

2396
01:53:57,480 --> 01:53:59,560
information it's things that can go back

2397
01:53:59,560 --> 01:54:02,320
and be tested tried and true and if you

2398
01:54:02,320 --> 01:54:05,040
can do that and and this does that for

2399
01:54:05,040 --> 01:54:07,040
you then this may very well do that for

2400
01:54:07,040 --> 01:54:09,560
someone else so just you know share the

2401
01:54:09,560 --> 01:54:11,440
video like the video share it in these

2402
01:54:11,440 --> 01:54:12,800
groups I know you guys are probably in a

2403
01:54:12,800 --> 01:54:14,599
bunch of telegram or Discord groups and

2404
01:54:14,599 --> 01:54:15,960
stuff like that just be like hey this

2405
01:54:15,960 --> 01:54:18,280
guy teaches live and live markets you

2406
01:54:18,280 --> 01:54:19,520
watch him you don't have to watch him

2407
01:54:19,520 --> 01:54:21,800
but he has some pretty good Concepts and

2408
01:54:21,800 --> 01:54:23,760
if you've learned something from this

2409
01:54:23,760 --> 01:54:27,320
then hopefully you you know can also

2410
01:54:27,320 --> 01:54:29,800
teach other people this too I don't care

2411
01:54:29,800 --> 01:54:32,239
about making this into a commodity I

2412
01:54:32,239 --> 01:54:34,079
don't care about making this into a

2413
01:54:34,079 --> 01:54:36,880
selling selling a course or cuz I could

2414
01:54:36,880 --> 01:54:38,400
put this all in a course sell it for I

2415
01:54:38,400 --> 01:54:40,520
could sell this course for $10,000 I

2416
01:54:40,520 --> 01:54:43,440
promise you I could sell this course

2417
01:54:43,440 --> 01:54:48,719
each course that I create based off of

2418
01:54:48,719 --> 01:54:52,599
ways that I have to to trade I can

2419
01:54:52,599 --> 01:54:57,119
certainly sell each course for

2420
01:54:57,119 --> 01:54:59,440
$10,000 because that's how good and

2421
01:54:59,440 --> 01:55:02,400
accurate this information is I don't

2422
01:55:02,400 --> 01:55:04,119
care I make my own money I don't care

2423
01:55:04,119 --> 01:55:06,159
about nobody else's money now if it's

2424
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:07,800
taken away from me like let's say I

2425
01:55:07,800 --> 01:55:09,719
start doing consultations one-on ones

2426
01:55:09,719 --> 01:55:11,199
with people and stuff and I start

2427
01:55:11,199 --> 01:55:12,800
charging for consultations because it

2428
01:55:12,800 --> 01:55:15,119
takes away from Trading then obviously

2429
01:55:15,119 --> 01:55:16,480
there's a possibility that I could do

2430
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,679
that but if it doesn't take away from

2431
01:55:18,679 --> 01:55:21,159
Trading there's no reason I I'm I'm

2432
01:55:21,159 --> 01:55:23,320
doing this because I love it I love

2433
01:55:23,320 --> 01:55:25,679
watching the markets I love watching all

2434
01:55:25,679 --> 01:55:28,599
of this happening over and over again so

2435
01:55:28,599 --> 01:55:30,800
this is just my love for it I used to

2436
01:55:30,800 --> 01:55:33,280
watch charts all day and all night and

2437
01:55:33,280 --> 01:55:34,079
not

2438
01:55:34,079 --> 01:55:36,639
stream why not show people what I'm

2439
01:55:36,639 --> 01:55:39,639
seeing and why why create like a a

2440
01:55:39,639 --> 01:55:41,639
commodity off of this why create some

2441
01:55:41,639 --> 01:55:43,639
type of service off of

2442
01:55:43,639 --> 01:55:46,199
this why would I do that I I shouldn't

2443
01:55:46,199 --> 01:55:48,480
have to do that I shouldn't want to do

2444
01:55:48,480 --> 01:55:50,400
that at that

2445
01:55:50,400 --> 01:55:52,440
like I should want to foster a community

2446
01:55:52,440 --> 01:55:55,239
of people who are making money and who

2447
01:55:55,239 --> 01:55:56,800
are learning different approaches to the

2448
01:55:56,800 --> 01:55:59,360
market and we could actually help each

2449
01:55:59,360 --> 01:56:01,239
other out with real life

2450
01:56:01,239 --> 01:56:05,000
skills like I know things about so much

2451
01:56:05,000 --> 01:56:06,599
like so many things I know things about

2452
01:56:06,599 --> 01:56:08,159
credit repair I know things about

2453
01:56:08,159 --> 01:56:11,040
getting business loans I know like the

2454
01:56:11,040 --> 01:56:12,920
The Well of knowledge that I have in my

2455
01:56:12,920 --> 01:56:14,560
brain is not just when it comes to

2456
01:56:14,560 --> 01:56:16,719
trading it's just the way my brain

2457
01:56:16,719 --> 01:56:18,280
processes things and the way that it

2458
01:56:18,280 --> 01:56:22,400
works but it's not like you you guys see

2459
01:56:22,400 --> 01:56:24,280
me do this and I'm very efficient in

2460
01:56:24,280 --> 01:56:26,679
this but I'm just as efficient in like

2461
01:56:26,679 --> 01:56:28,679
all the other areas of the things that I

2462
01:56:28,679 --> 01:56:31,400
consume too so I'm very very big on

2463
01:56:31,400 --> 01:56:33,480
sharing bad information with people

2464
01:56:33,480 --> 01:56:36,199
don't do that I'm not okay with that

2465
01:56:36,199 --> 01:56:37,760
this is people's money that's on the

2466
01:56:37,760 --> 01:56:40,440
line this is you know like people are

2467
01:56:40,440 --> 01:56:42,320
trying to get a better life people are

2468
01:56:42,320 --> 01:56:44,480
trying to change their live in

2469
01:56:44,480 --> 01:56:47,280
circumstances don't do that if the

2470
01:56:47,280 --> 01:56:50,000
information does not work

2471
01:56:50,000 --> 01:56:51,880
don't do that I don't care how much you

2472
01:56:51,880 --> 01:56:54,960
like me I don't like none of that I

2473
01:56:54,960 --> 01:56:56,920
don't care about any of that if this is

2474
01:56:56,920 --> 01:56:59,440
not helping you find something that

2475
01:56:59,440 --> 01:57:02,159
helps you and then teach that to

2476
01:57:02,159 --> 01:57:05,079
somebody else and send them the video of

2477
01:57:05,079 --> 01:57:07,159
whoever that was that helped you but if

2478
01:57:07,159 --> 01:57:08,639
this is not helping you don't share it

2479
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:11,400
with other people until it actually

2480
01:57:11,400 --> 01:57:14,159
begins to help you and that's how

2481
01:57:14,159 --> 01:57:16,119
serious I am with this I'm not building

2482
01:57:16,119 --> 01:57:18,639
a brand I'm not creating an Empire or

2483
01:57:18,639 --> 01:57:20,119
anything like that I'm just trying to

2484
01:57:20,119 --> 01:57:23,079
help people you know

2485
01:57:23,079 --> 01:57:25,760
and I I want to do it with the most

2486
01:57:25,760 --> 01:57:29,040
accurate information possible the most

2487
01:57:29,040 --> 01:57:31,760
accurate information possible and that's

2488
01:57:31,760 --> 01:57:34,199
why I'm I'm very big on like not sharing

2489
01:57:34,199 --> 01:57:38,280
certain things um with people because

2490
01:57:38,280 --> 01:57:40,679
again you know you want to make sure

2491
01:57:40,679 --> 01:57:44,000
that that you know it's it's the right

2492
01:57:44,000 --> 01:57:46,599
thing so I share Pips of Persia sham I

2493
01:57:46,599 --> 01:57:49,199
share um smart money Source because

2494
01:57:49,199 --> 01:57:51,159
those those guys I've tested seen that

2495
01:57:51,159 --> 01:57:52,679
they're tried and true with their

2496
01:57:52,679 --> 01:57:54,639
information it's accurate you can go

2497
01:57:54,639 --> 01:57:56,920
back and test it and see it in live

2498
01:57:56,920 --> 01:57:59,400
markets you know like amazing guys and

2499
01:57:59,400 --> 01:58:00,920
they don't even know me they don't even

2500
01:58:00,920 --> 01:58:03,440
know that I stream I've never had a

2501
01:58:03,440 --> 01:58:06,159
conversation with any of them but I know

2502
01:58:06,159 --> 01:58:08,199
quality work when I see it so I'm going

2503
01:58:08,199 --> 01:58:10,480
to continue to offer quality work to

2504
01:58:10,480 --> 01:58:13,920
people you know so yeah um yeah this

2505
01:58:13,920 --> 01:58:16,440
helps me a lot bro made like 1K using

2506
01:58:16,440 --> 01:58:18,520
your strategy oh that's great man I'm

2507
01:58:18,520 --> 01:58:20,320
I'm so happy about that I want you to do

2508
01:58:20,320 --> 01:58:23,719
that every day I was taking $600 and

2509
01:58:23,719 --> 01:58:27,440
making $1,000 every day with

2510
01:58:27,440 --> 01:58:30,960
$600 that's only $600 in my account I

2511
01:58:30,960 --> 01:58:34,400
was making $1,000 every single day and

2512
01:58:34,400 --> 01:58:36,400
this is when I was using retail patterns

2513
01:58:36,400 --> 01:58:38,400
I wasn't even trading this stuff I was

2514
01:58:38,400 --> 01:58:40,719
just using trend lines I'm like oh price

2515
01:58:40,719 --> 01:58:42,079
falls out of the trend line I'll get it

2516
01:58:42,079 --> 01:58:44,679
on a quick short and then wait for the

2517
01:58:44,679 --> 01:58:46,280
next trend line to form and get on a

2518
01:58:46,280 --> 01:58:48,440
quick short because the one minute forms

2519
01:58:48,440 --> 01:58:50,520
a bunch of trend lines

2520
01:58:50,520 --> 01:58:53,320
and then runs them or runs portions of

2521
01:58:53,320 --> 01:58:55,480
them so I was using that and that was

2522
01:58:55,480 --> 01:58:57,000
when I didn't know how to trade I don't

2523
01:58:57,000 --> 01:58:58,760
recommend using trend lines only to

2524
01:58:58,760 --> 01:59:00,599
trade with they could be a good source

2525
01:59:00,599 --> 01:59:03,560
of like helping you to notice something

2526
01:59:03,560 --> 01:59:05,440
and then like waiting for that

2527
01:59:05,440 --> 01:59:06,840
particular thing to happen I think I

2528
01:59:06,840 --> 01:59:10,920
have a trend line somewhere um

2529
01:59:10,920 --> 01:59:12,520
within

2530
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:15,760
Jesus Christ there's so much stuff

2531
01:59:15,760 --> 01:59:18,199
here add a trend line somewhere in here

2532
01:59:18,199 --> 01:59:20,280
I don't I don't know exactly oh my gosh

2533
01:59:20,280 --> 01:59:22,520
I think I deleted everything yikes let

2534
01:59:22,520 --> 01:59:25,239
me see if I can go

2535
01:59:30,560 --> 01:59:32,840
back yeah it looks like I deleted

2536
01:59:32,840 --> 01:59:36,320
everything oh that makes me so sad who

2537
01:59:36,320 --> 01:59:37,480
asked me that question and made me

2538
01:59:37,480 --> 01:59:41,239
delete all this no I'm kidding I have um

2539
01:59:41,239 --> 01:59:44,040
uh this chart over

2540
01:59:44,040 --> 01:59:47,239
here so yeah this this is where the top

2541
01:59:47,239 --> 01:59:48,480
down one's done that's why I have two

2542
01:59:48,480 --> 01:59:50,199
charts just in case I make a mistake on

2543
01:59:50,199 --> 01:59:54,119
one um they usually overlap sometimes uh

2544
01:59:54,119 --> 01:59:58,599
with the top down and stuff but yeah

2545
01:59:58,599 --> 02:00:02,639
um yeah this this was

2546
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:09,760
it so yeah look at how I mentioned that

2547
02:00:09,760 --> 02:00:12,639
we can come back to this area

2548
02:00:12,639 --> 02:00:15,520
here come back to this area now we want

2549
02:00:15,520 --> 02:00:17,800
to watch for this pattern potentially

2550
02:00:17,800 --> 02:00:22,360
forming here because we got one area

2551
02:00:22,360 --> 02:00:25,800
here right here we have another area

2552
02:00:25,800 --> 02:00:27,320
here but this would have to take the

2553
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:29,560
high first and then come back into the

2554
02:00:29,560 --> 02:00:33,280
area to give us that other area and then

2555
02:00:33,280 --> 02:00:36,360
potentially go long up into some of

2556
02:00:36,360 --> 02:00:38,840
these areas here or maybe even just to

2557
02:00:38,840 --> 02:00:40,440
this

2558
02:00:40,440 --> 02:00:42,560
imbalance so this is just what you want

2559
02:00:42,560 --> 02:00:46,360
to be careful of this is not really a

2560
02:00:46,360 --> 02:00:49,239
um we're not really finding like this

2561
02:00:49,239 --> 02:00:51,920
low right here is not really finding

2562
02:00:51,920 --> 02:00:55,119
support from like a particular area

2563
02:00:55,119 --> 02:00:57,040
that's fresh or

2564
02:00:57,040 --> 02:00:59,679
unmitigated so this can just have like a

2565
02:00:59,679 --> 02:01:03,079
suo pushup to tap into an area and go or

2566
02:01:03,079 --> 02:01:05,360
it can just continue to fall as we

2567
02:01:05,360 --> 02:01:07,560
mentioned from like up

2568
02:01:07,560 --> 02:01:09,719
here

2569
02:01:09,719 --> 02:01:13,560
um so yeah um uh but I'm glad this is

2570
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:15,719
helping people um and I want to continue

2571
02:01:15,719 --> 02:01:18,280
to be able to um it was this imbalance

2572
02:01:18,280 --> 02:01:19,880
here that I had mentioned guys so just

2573
02:01:19,880 --> 02:01:22,000
be careful of it right

2574
02:01:22,000 --> 02:01:26,079
here tap there and go um yeah exactly

2575
02:01:26,079 --> 02:01:27,520
naked women you you know what's so

2576
02:01:27,520 --> 02:01:29,800

this uh right here

2584
02:01:47,800 --> 02:01:50,480
analytics my my

2585
02:01:50,480 --> 02:01:54,040
audience uh let's

2586
02:01:54,040 --> 02:01:57,880
see let me show you guys

2587
02:01:58,360 --> 02:02:04,840
this um look at this 94% of my viewers

2588
02:02:04,840 --> 02:02:07,159
are

2589
02:02:07,440 --> 02:02:10,719
men the ladies don't love me at all

2590
02:02:10,719 --> 02:02:13,400
what's happening no I'm kidding uh but

2591
02:02:13,400 --> 02:02:17,960
yeah 90 94% of my viewers are

2592
02:02:17,960 --> 02:02:22,040
male and only 6% of the views come from

2593
02:02:22,040 --> 02:02:25,679
women and I promise you I promise you

2594
02:02:25,679 --> 02:02:28,920
because of like how amazing and

2595
02:02:28,920 --> 02:02:31,679
fantastic women can be I promise you

2596
02:02:31,679 --> 02:02:34,239
that the women in the chat could wipe

2597
02:02:34,239 --> 02:02:36,000
the floor with the man like they're just

2598
02:02:36,000 --> 02:02:38,719
so meticulous about things and like I

2599
02:02:38,719 --> 02:02:42,000
promise you it's be the day of

2600
02:02:42,000 --> 02:02:44,119
Armageddon if we had to trade against

2601
02:02:44,119 --> 02:02:45,760
most of the women because they're just

2602
02:02:45,760 --> 02:02:48,599
like so much attention and detail and

2603
02:02:48,599 --> 02:02:50,760
I'm telling this's one girl here now she

2604
02:02:50,760 --> 02:02:52,599
she would scraped the floor with me or

2605
02:02:52,599 --> 02:02:53,920
money she would scraped the floor with

2606
02:02:53,920 --> 02:02:56,000
me and she's going to probably be like

2607
02:02:56,000 --> 02:02:58,679
the best Traer in the world you know but

2608
02:02:58,679 --> 02:03:03,239
th this is what this this particular um

2609
02:03:03,239 --> 02:03:05,040
you know this this particular teaching

2610
02:03:05,040 --> 02:03:07,520
can afford you you know so look we have

2611
02:03:07,520 --> 02:03:09,599
this area above we also have this snd

2612
02:03:09,599 --> 02:03:12,520
here this is a hidden snd Above So price

2613
02:03:12,520 --> 02:03:14,400
could very well tap into this area and

2614
02:03:14,400 --> 02:03:17,079
go but this could be sufficient enough

2615
02:03:17,079 --> 02:03:19,960
to just you know put in another low if

2616
02:03:19,960 --> 02:03:21,000
it

2617
02:03:21,000 --> 02:03:23,960
did um that's if we were going to

2618
02:03:23,960 --> 02:03:26,679
continue short but this is why we trade

2619
02:03:26,679 --> 02:03:28,760
and we watch the algorithm and let the

2620
02:03:28,760 --> 02:03:31,440
algorithm show us exactly what it is

2621
02:03:31,440 --> 02:03:32,280
that it's

2622
02:03:32,280 --> 02:03:35,440
doing CU if it shows us that then we're

2623
02:03:35,440 --> 02:03:37,480
not making any decisions based on what

2624
02:03:37,480 --> 02:03:40,480
we think because I always say trade what

2625
02:03:40,480 --> 02:03:43,760
you see not what you think and I stole

2626
02:03:43,760 --> 02:03:45,920
that from the trader Jessica Lanes she's

2627
02:03:45,920 --> 02:03:48,040
a pretty good Trader as well um with

2628
02:03:48,040 --> 02:03:49,800
retail Concepts but I stole that from

2629
02:03:49,800 --> 02:03:53,840
her trade what you see not what you

2630
02:03:53,840 --> 02:03:55,840
think and I'm not endorsing her I don't

2631
02:03:55,840 --> 02:03:58,679
know um like people are great in

2632
02:03:58,679 --> 02:04:01,119
hindsight but Forward Motion you really

2633
02:04:01,119 --> 02:04:04,320
don't know what people are doing um so

2634
02:04:04,320 --> 02:04:07,040
that's that's a a real thing by the way

2635
02:04:07,040 --> 02:04:08,960
so I'm not endorsing her I'm just saying

2636
02:04:08,960 --> 02:04:10,520
that this is what she says which all of

2637
02:04:10,520 --> 02:04:12,840
them have like great sayings and stuff

2638
02:04:12,840 --> 02:04:15,079
like that

2639
02:04:15,079 --> 02:04:17,480
but you got to be a little skeptical of

2640
02:04:17,480 --> 02:04:19,360
that because know it's like those

2641
02:04:19,360 --> 02:04:21,719
millionaire motivational videos got to

2642
02:04:21,719 --> 02:04:24,199
sacrifice you got to pay the payment the

2643
02:04:24,199 --> 02:04:27,559
pavement you got to make sacrifices that

2644
02:04:27,559 --> 02:04:29,280
when you come back in the future you're

2645
02:04:29,280 --> 02:04:30,679
going to look back and be like yeah it

2646
02:04:30,679 --> 02:04:32,840
was worth it it was great and then they

2647
02:04:32,840 --> 02:04:35,119
tell you to go go to work and put in 16

2648
02:04:35,119 --> 02:04:38,040
hours on a shift and and then go back

2649
02:04:38,040 --> 02:04:39,520
home and listen to the video again to

2650
02:04:39,520 --> 02:04:41,880
pump you up for the next day no those

2651
02:04:41,880 --> 02:04:44,040
millionaire videos are garbage those

2652
02:04:44,040 --> 02:04:48,119
videos should only only be displayed if

2653
02:04:48,119 --> 02:04:50,559
they're show showing you exactly how to

2654
02:04:50,559 --> 02:04:52,639
become a millionaire other than that

2655
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:55,280
they're useless um so NZ you have

2656
02:04:55,280 --> 02:04:57,599
mentioned

2657
02:04:57,599 --> 02:05:02,679
um uh q n 100 it went

2658
02:05:02,679 --> 02:05:05,840
up uh as you analyze and it filled the

2659
02:05:05,840 --> 02:05:08,119
Gap um so I didn't know there was a

2660
02:05:08,119 --> 02:05:10,040
there was a gap but I remember I did

2661
02:05:10,040 --> 02:05:14,360
analyze it for you uh look at this so

2662
02:05:14,360 --> 02:05:16,280
this this is the this is the analysis

2663
02:05:16,280 --> 02:05:18,000
here I told him that we could either

2664
02:05:18,000 --> 02:05:21,639
come to this area here or this area here

2665
02:05:21,639 --> 02:05:23,800
so we tapped into the

2666
02:05:23,800 --> 02:05:26,719
area we formed the little Candlestick

2667
02:05:26,719 --> 02:05:28,920
structure that we like to

2668
02:05:28,920 --> 02:05:31,639
see and then we pushed up out of the

2669
02:05:31,639 --> 02:05:34,559
area look at where we're at now all the

2670
02:05:34,559 --> 02:05:38,280
way up here from this particular area

2671
02:05:38,280 --> 02:05:39,760
that we could we said we can get a

2672
02:05:39,760 --> 02:05:43,159
bounce from um later on in the day I

2673
02:05:43,159 --> 02:05:44,559
think this was yesterday it might have

2674
02:05:44,559 --> 02:05:49,199
been um but just within that area alone

2675
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:52,159
you know so yeah I'll um I'll analyze it

2676
02:05:52,159 --> 02:05:54,960
again um but it looks like we still have

2677
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:57,679
some some areas here from the top down

2678
02:05:57,679 --> 02:05:58,719
that we

2679
02:05:58,719 --> 02:06:00,920
did

2680
02:06:00,920 --> 02:06:04,159
um here yeah see there's there's still

2681
02:06:04,159 --> 02:06:07,679
some areas within this um top down but

2682
02:06:07,679 --> 02:06:09,679
what you want to consider if this is

2683
02:06:09,679 --> 02:06:13,679
going to continue bullish

2684
02:06:15,239 --> 02:06:17,599
um

2685
02:06:17,599 --> 02:06:20,599
um

2686
02:06:21,760 --> 02:06:23,840
tapped into the Zone came up you see we

2687
02:06:23,840 --> 02:06:25,400
got the double bottom on the imbalance

2688
02:06:25,400 --> 02:06:27,520
and we left we going to make sure you

2689
02:06:27,520 --> 02:06:29,599
see that at the areas of interest that

2690
02:06:29,599 --> 02:06:32,320
you're trading from um so we took out

2691
02:06:32,320 --> 02:06:34,639
this

2692
02:06:37,800 --> 02:06:41,040
High we ran this

2693
02:06:41,040 --> 02:06:43,280
High

2694
02:06:43,280 --> 02:06:46,159
um we want to look at the area that's

2695
02:06:46,159 --> 02:06:48,760
responsible for running the high as as

2696
02:06:48,760 --> 02:06:52,679
well as the range of the area

2697
02:06:52,679 --> 02:06:56,239
so that's

2698
02:06:56,639 --> 02:06:59,239
here so this is the last high this is

2699
02:06:59,239 --> 02:07:01,639
the last low we just put in a new high

2700
02:07:01,639 --> 02:07:05,599
so we're between this high and this low

2701
02:07:05,599 --> 02:07:09,239
here so we look

2702
02:07:10,559 --> 02:07:13,280
like it looks like we're coming back

2703
02:07:13,280 --> 02:07:17,320
around to somewhere within this region

2704
02:07:17,320 --> 02:07:20,520
here um

2705
02:07:22,239 --> 02:07:24,320
somewhere within this region let me take

2706
02:07:24,320 --> 02:07:27,040
the whole move

2707
02:07:27,040 --> 02:07:29,320
here

2708
02:07:29,320 --> 02:07:31,880
um yeah we could be coming back to tap

2709
02:07:31,880 --> 02:07:35,079
within this area um let me actually just

2710
02:07:35,079 --> 02:07:37,079
look at what happened in

2711
02:07:37,079 --> 02:07:42,280
here before I let you guys know that uh

2712
02:07:42,280 --> 02:07:45,800
uh uh um we got a test of this area when

2713
02:07:45,800 --> 02:07:47,520
we broke

2714
02:07:47,520 --> 02:07:50,520
above

2715
02:07:51,960 --> 02:07:56,239
yeah we already got a test of this area

2716
02:07:58,480 --> 02:08:02,639
um we got to tap into this area this is

2717
02:08:02,639 --> 02:08:04,679
unmitigated down

2718
02:08:04,679 --> 02:08:07,599
here

2719
02:08:07,599 --> 02:08:10,480
um so we could get a tap within this

2720
02:08:10,480 --> 02:08:13,559
area on NAS if we're coming

2721
02:08:13,559 --> 02:08:17,119
down um this could actually be the area

2722
02:08:17,119 --> 02:08:20,639
that we begin to trade higher

2723
02:08:20,639 --> 02:08:23,639
from

2724
02:08:26,760 --> 02:08:30,360
um did we get a test oh so this is the

2725
02:08:30,360 --> 02:08:33,880
overall schematic

2726
02:08:34,880 --> 02:08:38,159
here um this is the overall schematic

2727
02:08:38,159 --> 02:08:40,480
here you see how we said we like to get

2728
02:08:40,480 --> 02:08:43,639
that in place and then we want to see

2729
02:08:43,639 --> 02:08:46,719
price trade out of it and come back and

2730
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:49,199
test it and then go

2731
02:08:49,199 --> 02:08:52,679
so if we're going to continue um bullish

2732
02:08:52,679 --> 02:08:56,199
to the top side

2733
02:08:56,199 --> 02:08:58,960
um price would end up tucking back into

2734
02:08:58,960 --> 02:09:02,000
this area and then

2735
02:09:02,440 --> 02:09:05,360
leaving but if it continues bullish like

2736
02:09:05,360 --> 02:09:08,840
it did here you see how we had this area

2737
02:09:08,840 --> 02:09:11,079
here we pushed up

2738
02:09:11,079 --> 02:09:14,079
bullish we ran this

2739
02:09:14,079 --> 02:09:19,280
high and then we flipped bearish

2740
02:09:19,280 --> 02:09:21,639
so the area that we may potentially be

2741
02:09:21,639 --> 02:09:24,720
coming back to is this area here

2742
02:09:24,720 --> 02:09:25,760
[Music]

2743
02:09:25,760 --> 02:09:29,760
overall we could be looking to test this

2744
02:09:29,760 --> 02:09:33,760
but we have quite a ways to get up there

2745
02:09:33,760 --> 02:09:38,040
so um what we may end up doing

2746
02:09:38,040 --> 02:09:41,360
is having a tap within this

2747
02:09:41,360 --> 02:09:44,239
area coming back to here and then

2748
02:09:44,239 --> 02:09:47,239
trading higher and then if you open up

2749
02:09:47,239 --> 02:09:50,320
the schematic a little more you begin to

2750
02:09:50,320 --> 02:09:55,599
see that it looks like a larger 4H hour

2751
02:09:55,599 --> 02:09:57,400
setup like

2752
02:09:57,400 --> 02:10:01,400
this so then as we continue to go up we

2753
02:10:01,400 --> 02:10:04,520
come back and possibly test this area

2754
02:10:04,520 --> 02:10:07,800
now and then we put in more highs that's

2755
02:10:07,800 --> 02:10:10,440
if price continues to trade higher

2756
02:10:10,440 --> 02:10:12,159
that's how it would be moving on the

2757
02:10:12,159 --> 02:10:16,280
higher time frames so again like we said

2758
02:10:16,280 --> 02:10:17,880
we could see all time frames from the

2759
02:10:17,880 --> 02:10:19,639
same time time frame because time is

2760
02:10:19,639 --> 02:10:22,159
fractal so um if you're looking for a

2761
02:10:22,159 --> 02:10:25,719
more immediate move then no it's it's

2762
02:10:25,719 --> 02:10:27,280
cool if you have a bunch of questions I

2763
02:10:27,280 --> 02:10:29,559
love that people ask questions I love

2764
02:10:29,559 --> 02:10:31,199
that people want me to look at charts

2765
02:10:31,199 --> 02:10:33,320
I'm completely okay with that trust me

2766
02:10:33,320 --> 02:10:36,040
there's no issue at all I'm asking

2767
02:10:36,040 --> 02:10:39,679
questions so this is a low

2768
02:10:39,679 --> 02:10:43,239
that this is a 15minute low so this is

2769
02:10:43,239 --> 02:10:47,239
this is an important low but

2770
02:10:47,239 --> 02:10:50,239
then

2771
02:10:51,320 --> 02:10:53,880
we have this area above here we already

2772
02:10:53,880 --> 02:10:56,679
mitigated this snd Zone with this so

2773
02:10:56,679 --> 02:10:59,040
this is left

2774
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:02,040
unmitigated we tap into this

2775
02:11:02,040 --> 02:11:04,520
area we push above

2776
02:11:04,520 --> 02:11:08,480
it we tap into the center of this

2777
02:11:08,480 --> 02:11:11,920
hidden snd right

2778
02:11:11,920 --> 02:11:15,119
here we tap we reject

2779
02:11:15,119 --> 02:11:17,159
out

2780
02:11:17,159 --> 02:11:20,159
um

2781
02:11:24,520 --> 02:11:26,920
put in this low came back

2782
02:11:26,920 --> 02:11:31,159
up we ran the high but what happened

2783
02:11:31,159 --> 02:11:33,719
first

2784
02:11:40,559 --> 02:11:43,199
here so we traded above the high went

2785
02:11:43,199 --> 02:11:47,320
into the low and then we came back up so

2786
02:11:47,320 --> 02:11:49,719
this area potentially is already

2787
02:11:49,719 --> 02:11:52,719
mitigated just because it did

2788
02:11:52,719 --> 02:11:55,719
that

2789
02:11:56,840 --> 02:12:02,480
um but then we tapped up into this area

2790
02:12:03,320 --> 02:12:06,400
here this area here that it left behind

2791
02:12:06,400 --> 02:12:08,559
so we might be trading higher to come up

2792
02:12:08,559 --> 02:12:11,400
into these areas

2793
02:12:11,400 --> 02:12:15,719
here because if you look right

2794
02:12:17,079 --> 02:12:19,360
here

2795
02:12:19,360 --> 02:12:22,159
this was the tap of the area

2796
02:12:22,159 --> 02:12:25,159
here

2797
02:12:25,559 --> 02:12:29,079
um we tapped into this area pulled back

2798
02:12:29,079 --> 02:12:33,960
up we have a snd right above

2799
02:12:40,679 --> 02:12:43,679
here we have a snd above here if it gets

2800
02:12:43,679 --> 02:12:47,040
rejected from here

2801
02:12:47,040 --> 02:12:50,040
then

2802
02:12:52,679 --> 02:12:55,400
here if it gets rejected from here then

2803
02:12:55,400 --> 02:12:59,199
that could potentially be um the equal

2804
02:12:59,199 --> 02:13:02,119
high that results in the run of the low

2805
02:13:02,119 --> 02:13:04,280
or the run of the lows in this

2806
02:13:04,280 --> 02:13:06,920
particular case but we may still be able

2807
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:09,320
to get up into this area here this is

2808
02:13:09,320 --> 02:13:13,599
mitigated this is mitigated this one is

2809
02:13:16,000 --> 02:13:19,960
not this one is not

2810
02:13:24,440 --> 02:13:27,320
yeah this one isn't so just be mindful

2811
02:13:27,320 --> 02:13:30,480
that if we do make our way up above this

2812
02:13:30,480 --> 02:13:33,559
High we could potentially be going to

2813
02:13:33,559 --> 02:13:36,559
this area here because there's a lack of

2814
02:13:36,559 --> 02:13:39,040
mitigation but sometimes you have it to

2815
02:13:39,040 --> 02:13:43,320
where price comes to here I know this is

2816
02:13:43,320 --> 02:13:47,040
a 15 minute um so it could take some

2817
02:13:47,040 --> 02:13:52,000
time to get here but sometimes you might

2818
02:13:52,000 --> 02:13:55,440
have right here you might get this

2819
02:13:55,440 --> 02:13:57,719
rejection

2820
02:13:57,719 --> 02:14:00,199
first here you might have this come up

2821
02:14:00,199 --> 02:14:02,119
to this you might reject back into here

2822
02:14:02,119 --> 02:14:04,199
you might have it come here reject back

2823
02:14:04,199 --> 02:14:06,360
into here then you might have it come up

2824
02:14:06,360 --> 02:14:08,520
here reject

2825
02:14:08,520 --> 02:14:12,040
here create a equal

2826
02:14:12,040 --> 02:14:15,400
High run the low come back in here and

2827
02:14:15,400 --> 02:14:18,880
then leave the whole area um you could

2828
02:14:18,880 --> 02:14:21,320
potentially have that up within this

2829
02:14:21,320 --> 02:14:24,320
area um but it looks like there's a

2830
02:14:24,320 --> 02:14:26,800
potential for price to continue to um

2831
02:14:26,800 --> 02:14:29,239
push higher um so that's just what I'm

2832
02:14:29,239 --> 02:14:31,719
seeing with nas um and you can just

2833
02:14:31,719 --> 02:14:34,800
follow that potentially and um see we

2834
02:14:34,800 --> 02:14:37,920
might really be going down if we run

2835
02:14:37,920 --> 02:14:41,199
this low here so we're within this range

2836
02:14:41,199 --> 02:14:43,360
right

2837
02:14:45,599 --> 02:14:49,199
now on this low here we're within this

2838
02:14:49,199 --> 02:14:51,840
range right

2839
02:14:52,559 --> 02:14:55,960
now so this

2840
02:14:55,960 --> 02:14:58,280
is this is the top of the

2841
02:14:58,280 --> 02:15:00,040
[Music]

2842
02:15:00,040 --> 02:15:03,159
range I don't really use this but I know

2843
02:15:03,159 --> 02:15:06,920
if it might be helpful for you so this

2844
02:15:06,920 --> 02:15:09,719
is this is the range that we're in here

2845
02:15:09,719 --> 02:15:12,639
and this

2846
02:15:16,800 --> 02:15:21,679
is 126 pip range so you just got to see

2847
02:15:21,679 --> 02:15:23,639
what kind of happens within here the

2848
02:15:23,639 --> 02:15:26,280
story of what it tells within here and

2849
02:15:26,280 --> 02:15:28,079
then that gives you the breakout whether

2850
02:15:28,079 --> 02:15:31,360
it's below or above and that's how the

2851
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:32,960
that's how the Nas is looking so look we

2852
02:15:32,960 --> 02:15:34,840
just got the top of this area we want to

2853
02:15:34,840 --> 02:15:36,159
see what it does there if it doesn't

2854
02:15:36,159 --> 02:15:37,880
give you a double top there on a smaller

2855
02:15:37,880 --> 02:15:39,400
time frame then it could potentially

2856
02:15:39,400 --> 02:15:42,320
still be traveling to the the areas

2857
02:15:42,320 --> 02:15:43,639
further

2858
02:15:43,639 --> 02:15:48,040
above um but you can correlate um this

2859
02:15:48,040 --> 02:15:52,040
chart you can correlate the the us500 or

2860
02:15:52,040 --> 02:15:55,280
or the Russell 2000 is it um you can

2861
02:15:55,280 --> 02:15:57,400
correlate that because they move hand

2862
02:15:57,400 --> 02:16:00,119
inand this one has already moved 1 th000

2863
02:16:00,119 --> 02:16:03,199
Pips since it opened this is the S&P

2864
02:16:03,199 --> 02:16:05,520
moves more than all of the other indices

2865
02:16:05,520 --> 02:16:07,920
together all the indices generally

2866
02:16:07,920 --> 02:16:09,960
follow the

2867
02:16:09,960 --> 02:16:12,559
S&P um so yeah that's that's the top

2868
02:16:12,559 --> 02:16:16,079
down for NZ uh you welcome uh for that

2869
02:16:16,079 --> 02:16:18,000
um I know I spent you know quite a bit

2870
02:16:18,000 --> 02:16:20,559
of time there let's go back to us30 see

2871
02:16:20,559 --> 02:16:23,679
what we have Happening

2872
02:16:25,199 --> 02:16:26,840
Here

2873
02:16:26,840 --> 02:16:30,960
Yeah so look here here was here's here

2874
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:33,638
was the the um entry you see the

2875
02:16:33,638 --> 02:16:36,920
manipulation manipulation down then

2876
02:16:36,920 --> 02:16:39,359
price shifts up and breaks the high we

2877
02:16:39,359 --> 02:16:41,160
tap back into the area that was

2878
02:16:41,160 --> 02:16:43,599
manipulated and we longed from that area

2879
02:16:43,599 --> 02:16:45,080
to go up

2880
02:16:45,080 --> 02:16:47,718
here it's the same thing over and over

2881
02:16:47,718 --> 02:16:49,240
over and over again and I want you guys

2882
02:16:49,240 --> 02:16:51,000
to see it because it happens over and

2883
02:16:51,000 --> 02:16:52,599
over and over and over and over and over

2884
02:16:52,599 --> 02:16:54,920
and over and over and

2885
02:16:54,920 --> 02:16:59,478
over over and over again like over and

2886
02:16:59,478 --> 02:17:01,478
over and over people think I'm a

2887
02:17:01,478 --> 02:17:04,000
magician no over and over again remember

2888
02:17:04,000 --> 02:17:06,240
what I said about this I said we could

2889
02:17:06,240 --> 02:17:08,599
potentially come up above this High we

2890
02:17:08,599 --> 02:17:10,599
can come back into this area and we

2891
02:17:10,599 --> 02:17:12,760
might go long I said that when this was

2892
02:17:12,760 --> 02:17:14,920
consolidating here because I said here

2893
02:17:14,920 --> 02:17:18,280
was the stab but I had mentioned that

2894
02:17:18,280 --> 02:17:21,120
we're not really in an area um like an

2895
02:17:21,120 --> 02:17:24,080
important area um we're not really there

2896
02:17:24,080 --> 02:17:26,920
so I don't really see this pushing up to

2897
02:17:26,920 --> 02:17:30,718
break the high it can not too sure but I

2898
02:17:30,718 --> 02:17:32,638
did see that we were gearing up to come

2899
02:17:32,638 --> 02:17:35,398
back up to this area up here and it was

2900
02:17:35,398 --> 02:17:38,200
because the rules and the principles

2901
02:17:38,200 --> 02:17:40,280
within this

2902
02:17:40,280 --> 02:17:43,439
here within this this same pattern that

2903
02:17:43,439 --> 02:17:45,040
I try to get you guys to see maybe on

2904
02:17:45,040 --> 02:17:46,599
the five minute it looks

2905
02:17:46,599 --> 02:17:48,478
cleaner

2906
02:17:48,478 --> 02:17:50,718
same pattern that I try to get you guys

2907
02:17:50,718 --> 02:17:53,920
to see over and over again I'm like a

2908
02:17:53,920 --> 02:17:55,200
mother

2909
02:17:55,200 --> 02:17:58,398
repeating things over and over again

2910
02:17:58,398 --> 02:18:01,679
same pattern here within an area of

2911
02:18:01,679 --> 02:18:04,599
Interest here so this is where the the

2912
02:18:04,599 --> 02:18:07,040
higher time frames become pretty good to

2913
02:18:07,040 --> 02:18:09,679
you know take a look at because if you

2914
02:18:09,679 --> 02:18:12,359
guys look at

2915
02:18:12,558 --> 02:18:16,239
this on the five

2916
02:18:16,519 --> 02:18:19,760
minute it's it's fine to take a peak um

2917
02:18:19,760 --> 02:18:21,840
if you want to at them but if you look

2918
02:18:21,840 --> 02:18:24,240
at this here look we went above this

2919
02:18:24,240 --> 02:18:28,200
area here so we dropped down we ran the

2920
02:18:28,200 --> 02:18:30,920
high of this area price never came back

2921
02:18:30,920 --> 02:18:34,718
up so what do we do we look for price to

2922
02:18:34,718 --> 02:18:37,638
return back into the range of the area

2923
02:18:37,638 --> 02:18:40,040
look at the tap that we get beep right

2924
02:18:40,040 --> 02:18:42,439
there and we trade higher so we could

2925
02:18:42,439 --> 02:18:44,359
potentially be looking to trade higher

2926
02:18:44,359 --> 02:18:47,160
if we go up above this here but it's the

2927
02:18:47,160 --> 02:18:52,280
same thing that's on NAS areas above

2928
02:18:52,280 --> 02:18:54,200
that we have

2929
02:18:54,200 --> 02:18:59,319
us500 well this actually looks like

2930
02:19:02,280 --> 02:19:05,160
um this actually looks

2931
02:19:05,160 --> 02:19:08,160
like it's going

2932
02:19:08,160 --> 02:19:11,920
up it looks like it's

2933
02:19:12,599 --> 02:19:16,439
still pushing up

2934
02:19:16,439 --> 02:19:19,439
um

2935
02:19:25,080 --> 02:19:29,000
so this grabs the High

2936
02:19:29,000 --> 02:19:33,800
um you could potentially have it to

2937
02:19:34,558 --> 02:19:37,200
where the rest of everything goes up

2938
02:19:37,200 --> 02:19:40,558
above their areas

2939
02:19:40,558 --> 02:19:43,999
too but look at

2940
02:19:46,160 --> 02:19:50,040
this free forget the high cuz as we said

2941
02:19:50,040 --> 02:19:52,000
manipulation trades back down within the

2942
02:19:52,000 --> 02:19:54,160
range of the area don't care about that

2943
02:19:54,160 --> 02:19:57,760
forget the high look we tap here go

2944
02:19:57,760 --> 02:20:02,120
where do we go down to and imbalance

2945
02:20:02,120 --> 02:20:04,600
here and all it takes is just spotting

2946
02:20:04,600 --> 02:20:08,399
this stuff real fast in real

2947
02:20:16,359 --> 02:20:19,800
time I hate this area because I feel

2948
02:20:19,800 --> 02:20:23,319
like when I'm trying to like Center it

2949
02:20:23,319 --> 02:20:27,080
exactly my hand starts cramping up and

2950
02:20:27,080 --> 02:20:29,120
I'm like not now I need to get it

2951
02:20:29,120 --> 02:20:31,280
perfect cuz I'm a little bit of a

2952
02:20:31,280 --> 02:20:34,399
perfectionist so look we short from

2953
02:20:34,399 --> 02:20:38,000
here we short from this

2954
02:20:38,000 --> 02:20:40,240
area and we come all the way down to

2955
02:20:40,240 --> 02:20:42,399
this area

2956
02:20:42,399 --> 02:20:46,120
here and we get here in 3 minutes after

2957
02:20:46,120 --> 02:20:47,640
noticing the tap there but but then we

2958
02:20:47,640 --> 02:20:50,880
get a tap here and what do we

2959
02:20:50,880 --> 02:20:54,640
get we get the structure to know that

2960
02:20:54,640 --> 02:20:57,760
we're going to flip the high we get the

2961
02:20:57,760 --> 02:21:00,680
Candlestick pattern to know that we're

2962
02:21:00,680 --> 02:21:02,960
flipping

2963
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:05,680
above but what is it

2964
02:21:05,680 --> 02:21:08,720
that we talk about we put in this low we

2965
02:21:08,720 --> 02:21:10,680
put in this High we put in this low we

2966
02:21:10,680 --> 02:21:12,439
get a run up the high we tap back into

2967
02:21:12,439 --> 02:21:14,680
the area and then we

2968
02:21:14,680 --> 02:21:18,080
go and it's it's this simple over and

2969
02:21:18,080 --> 02:21:20,000
over and over again it doesn't always

2970
02:21:20,000 --> 02:21:22,479
look the same but it always happens the

2971
02:21:22,479 --> 02:21:24,800
same way and this is why I was telling I

2972
02:21:24,800 --> 02:21:27,640
think it was um Tav it might have been I

2973
02:21:27,640 --> 02:21:30,720
was telling them about the inside you

2974
02:21:30,720 --> 02:21:33,439
want to look at what's happening within

2975
02:21:33,439 --> 02:21:36,800
here you need rules for this the rules

2976
02:21:36,800 --> 02:21:39,600
is that we put in this low we put in

2977
02:21:39,600 --> 02:21:43,520
this High we ran this

2978
02:21:43,520 --> 02:21:46,840
low and then we ran the high directly

2979
02:21:46,840 --> 02:21:48,880
after

2980
02:21:48,880 --> 02:21:51,920
manipulation downside and upside we tap

2981
02:21:51,920 --> 02:21:54,399
back into a premium area and then we

2982
02:21:54,399 --> 02:21:56,800
trade out of it and that's that's all

2983
02:21:56,800 --> 02:21:59,160
you ever need to know with trading just

2984
02:21:59,160 --> 02:22:01,760
spot that that's it nothing else so look

2985
02:22:01,760 --> 02:22:03,640
we took this High here and I said we

2986
02:22:03,640 --> 02:22:06,720
could be trading higher let's look at

2987
02:22:06,720 --> 02:22:10,040
this here oh my gosh these delivery

2988
02:22:10,040 --> 02:22:13,640
people are always ringing my

2989
02:22:13,760 --> 02:22:17,240
doorbell look at that what did we do we

2990
02:22:17,240 --> 02:22:19,240
took this high

2991
02:22:19,240 --> 02:22:22,120
too I said if we were taking the high on

2992
02:22:22,120 --> 02:22:24,560
S&P 500 then we're probably going to

2993
02:22:24,560 --> 02:22:26,640
take the high here I don't know who this

2994
02:22:26,640 --> 02:22:29,319
is hold on let me

2995
02:22:46,160 --> 02:22:49,160
check

2996
02:23:01,319 --> 02:23:05,000
sorry that was my obnoxious kid uh so

2997
02:23:05,000 --> 02:23:07,880
look NZ we still didn't get up

2998
02:23:07,880 --> 02:23:11,399
above but we took the the recent high

2999
02:23:11,399 --> 02:23:14,439
that was here so now what we want to

3000
02:23:14,439 --> 02:23:17,640
look for is is this test tting the

3001
02:23:17,640 --> 02:23:20,439
Candlestick pattern that it left for us

3002
02:23:20,439 --> 02:23:23,080
here is this just a test of it to trade

3003
02:23:23,080 --> 02:23:25,680
higher up into this

3004
02:23:25,680 --> 02:23:28,399
area or are we

3005
02:23:28,399 --> 02:23:31,439
running cuz we we will eventually but

3006
02:23:31,439 --> 02:23:34,800
are we running the trend line

3007
02:23:36,040 --> 02:23:39,520
low so is it going to be like

3008
02:23:39,520 --> 02:23:44,439
this we could tap into this little area

3009
02:23:45,680 --> 02:23:49,439
here this little area here because this

3010
02:23:49,439 --> 02:23:51,880
resulted in the structural break above

3011
02:23:51,880 --> 02:23:54,240
here or maybe there's an imbalance

3012
02:23:54,240 --> 02:23:57,680
within here that price is going to let

3013
02:23:57,680 --> 02:23:59,479
me let me zoom in cuz I know I'm seeing

3014
02:23:59,479 --> 02:24:02,000
it from like that very tiny uh portion

3015
02:24:02,000 --> 02:24:04,920
of it but you guys are probably not not

3016
02:24:04,920 --> 02:24:07,640
really seeing it well uh but yeah this

3017
02:24:07,640 --> 02:24:10,479
this area here you know we can tap up

3018
02:24:10,479 --> 02:24:11,319
into

3019
02:24:11,319 --> 02:24:14,200
this you know potentially get a tap and

3020
02:24:14,200 --> 02:24:16,200
oh we it looks like we already got a tap

3021
02:24:16,200 --> 02:24:17,600
on top of it

3022
02:24:17,600 --> 02:24:19,399
but we can tap into the middle of this

3023
02:24:19,399 --> 02:24:23,680
and then continue up as well but this

3024
02:24:23,680 --> 02:24:26,359
only happened here this push up only

3025
02:24:26,359 --> 02:24:28,840
happened because of this imbalance below

3026
02:24:28,840 --> 02:24:31,120
so we could even come down to the tip of

3027
02:24:31,120 --> 02:24:33,680
this which would also be a second touch

3028
02:24:33,680 --> 02:24:36,680
of the imbalance and then potentially

3029
02:24:36,680 --> 02:24:38,920
trade higher so this is an area that you

3030
02:24:38,920 --> 02:24:41,160
want to watch out for if you're in Nas

3031
02:24:41,160 --> 02:24:43,600
by the way um and I'm supposed to be

3032
02:24:43,600 --> 02:24:45,560
doing us30 sorry

3033
02:24:45,560 --> 02:24:47,790
guys goodbye back to the

3034
02:24:47,790 --> 02:24:49,359
[Music]

3035
02:24:49,359 --> 02:24:52,040
30 yeah okay so you see how this

3036
02:24:52,040 --> 02:24:55,040
Candlestick pattern here gave us a new

3037
02:24:55,040 --> 02:24:57,960
high after tapping into an area to the

3038
02:24:57,960 --> 02:24:59,800
left now granted we mentioned that we

3039
02:24:59,800 --> 02:25:02,080
didn't think that this area was strong

3040
02:25:02,080 --> 02:25:04,720
enough to give us a high but we said

3041
02:25:04,720 --> 02:25:08,479
we'll see we saw this being created down

3042
02:25:08,479 --> 02:25:11,319
here on the entry so we were like oh

3043
02:25:11,319 --> 02:25:14,479
wait okay no this looks like this that

3044
02:25:14,479 --> 02:25:16,520
pattern that we usually see this looks

3045
02:25:16,520 --> 02:25:18,760
like a could be heading to the top side

3046
02:25:18,760 --> 02:25:21,479
and what did we get from this area here

3047
02:25:21,479 --> 02:25:24,040
going all the way up to here at first we

3048
02:25:24,040 --> 02:25:26,439
thought we were just rejecting from here

3049
02:25:26,439 --> 02:25:28,800
so that was our bias to come up but we

3050
02:25:28,800 --> 02:25:31,520
pushed all the way up and came back in

3051
02:25:31,520 --> 02:25:34,560
and got rejected in this area not only

3052
02:25:34,560 --> 02:25:37,319
did we get rejected in this area right

3053
02:25:37,319 --> 02:25:40,600
here you guys see this let

3054
02:25:40,600 --> 02:25:43,640
me so we come down here we come back up

3055
02:25:43,640 --> 02:25:45,880
here we come down here and then we end

3056
02:25:45,880 --> 02:25:48,600
up running the high

3057
02:25:48,600 --> 02:25:51,120
here running the high here look we ran

3058
02:25:51,120 --> 02:25:54,319
the high right there we came back into

3059
02:25:54,319 --> 02:25:56,479
the area here actually no wait let me

3060
02:25:56,479 --> 02:25:58,800
make sure I'm not lying because people

3061
02:25:58,800 --> 02:26:01,359
be lying on God's internet and I'm not

3062
02:26:01,359 --> 02:26:02,160
trying

3063
02:26:02,160 --> 02:26:06,279
to be that person at all um let's see so

3064
02:26:06,279 --> 02:26:09,840
we put in a low we get a run of the high

3065
02:26:09,840 --> 02:26:13,600
let me see if this candle

3066
02:26:13,600 --> 02:26:16,479
actually I want to see if it went up

3067
02:26:16,479 --> 02:26:20,880
above this High first and then came back

3068
02:26:20,880 --> 02:26:21,920
below the

3069
02:26:21,920 --> 02:26:24,960
low because sometimes it'll mitigate an

3070
02:26:24,960 --> 02:26:27,880
area just within the same candle so let

3071
02:26:27,880 --> 02:26:33,240
me look um whoop There we go mitigate

3072
02:26:33,240 --> 02:26:35,760
came back into the center of it and then

3073
02:26:35,760 --> 02:26:38,200
left so

3074
02:26:38,200 --> 02:26:41,640
that's that's what we got within that

3075
02:26:41,640 --> 02:26:45,720
area so this here was only a second

3076
02:26:45,720 --> 02:26:47,760
touch within the area so I told you the

3077
02:26:47,760 --> 02:26:51,040
first area is the scalp up this if it

3078
02:26:51,040 --> 02:26:53,520
returns to the area second time that

3079
02:26:53,520 --> 02:26:56,800
becomes your longer move but when it

3080
02:26:56,800 --> 02:26:59,399
returns a second time what you need is

3081
02:26:59,399 --> 02:27:02,200
not a tap on the second time you need a

3082
02:27:02,200 --> 02:27:05,680
double bottom for the second time so the

3083
02:27:05,680 --> 02:27:09,520
first entry was actually

3084
02:27:09,520 --> 02:27:14,240
here this one here stops behind the zone

3085
02:27:14,240 --> 02:27:16,040
and you're looking to potentially take

3086
02:27:16,040 --> 02:27:17,399
it to

3087
02:27:17,399 --> 02:27:19,040
you know like the next structural area

3088
02:27:19,040 --> 02:27:22,080
usually I say um utilize the imbalance

3089
02:27:22,080 --> 02:27:26,080
or the snd so that's the top quick tap

3090
02:27:26,080 --> 02:27:28,960
you're out then we get the second entry

3091
02:27:28,960 --> 02:27:30,760
back into here but remember we're not

3092
02:27:30,760 --> 02:27:32,760
only buying because we saw this push

3093
02:27:32,760 --> 02:27:36,240
back into the area we're going to buy

3094
02:27:36,240 --> 02:27:40,200
because the same thing that we saw

3095
02:27:40,200 --> 02:27:44,160
here for us to get involved is the same

3096
02:27:44,160 --> 02:27:45,920
thing the same thing that we see here

3097
02:27:45,920 --> 02:27:47,720
this this entire thing

3098
02:27:47,720 --> 02:27:50,680
here

3099
02:27:50,680 --> 02:27:53,880
sorry why is this not I'm always maybe

3100
02:27:53,880 --> 02:27:55,600
maybe I'm getting like carpal tunnel or

3101
02:27:55,600 --> 02:27:57,880
something I don't know my clicks don't

3102
02:27:57,880 --> 02:28:00,800
be clicking the math be mathing but the

3103
02:28:00,800 --> 02:28:03,800
clicks don't be clicking so we get this

3104
02:28:03,800 --> 02:28:05,560
area

3105
02:28:05,560 --> 02:28:07,720
here right

3106
02:28:07,720 --> 02:28:10,760
here and we end up making the pattern

3107
02:28:10,760 --> 02:28:14,359
within the area but within this area

3108
02:28:14,359 --> 02:28:18,240
here where your second entry is

3109
02:28:18,240 --> 02:28:20,160
look for the double

3110
02:28:20,160 --> 02:28:22,479
bottom and it's not really a double

3111
02:28:22,479 --> 02:28:25,319
bottom what it is is the same thing that

3112
02:28:25,319 --> 02:28:26,760
happened

3113
02:28:26,760 --> 02:28:30,319
here you see this

3114
02:28:34,040 --> 02:28:36,479
here the same thing that happened here

3115
02:28:36,479 --> 02:28:39,680
like this or that happens everywhere

3116
02:28:39,680 --> 02:28:41,640
we're looking for it to happen around

3117
02:28:41,640 --> 02:28:45,600
our entry so what do we

3118
02:28:45,600 --> 02:28:47,640
get

3119
02:28:47,640 --> 02:28:50,760
we come down from

3120
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:54,560
here we make our way back up

3121
02:28:54,560 --> 02:28:58,479
here we make our way down here we run

3122
02:28:58,479 --> 02:29:02,640
the high we tap back into the area and

3123
02:29:02,640 --> 02:29:03,680
then we

3124
02:29:03,680 --> 02:29:08,120
long so now you not only

3125
02:29:08,120 --> 02:29:10,560
had this one

3126
02:29:10,560 --> 02:29:13,680
entry across the way as a scalp now you

3127
02:29:13,680 --> 02:29:15,520
have the longer move

3128
02:29:15,520 --> 02:29:17,240
here

3129
02:29:17,240 --> 02:29:18,920
because we returned a second time and

3130
02:29:18,920 --> 02:29:20,240
gave you

3131
02:29:20,240 --> 02:29:23,160
that so now with this move we're

3132
02:29:23,160 --> 02:29:26,080
expecting this move to either come here

3133
02:29:26,080 --> 02:29:29,160
or to run all the highs because once it

3134
02:29:29,160 --> 02:29:31,200
runs this High these Highs are going to

3135
02:29:31,200 --> 02:29:34,640
be ran as well cuz all of this is

3136
02:29:34,640 --> 02:29:36,680
mitigated so that's how you get the

3137
02:29:36,680 --> 02:29:40,479
second entry and now you end up walking

3138
02:29:40,479 --> 02:29:45,160
away with 31 Pips here 52 Pips here 83

3139
02:29:45,160 --> 02:29:48,520
Pips on the day

3140
02:29:51,279 --> 02:29:55,080
within within 24

3141
02:29:55,080 --> 02:29:59,479
minutes 80 83 Pips within 24 minutes now

3142
02:29:59,479 --> 02:30:02,600
if if this was um if this was the

3143
02:30:02,600 --> 02:30:04,720
regular like the the low lot size that

3144
02:30:04,720 --> 02:30:05,439
I'm

3145
02:30:05,439 --> 02:30:09,960
using this is I mean for both trades

3146
02:30:09,960 --> 02:30:11,880
this is over

3147
02:30:11,880 --> 02:30:14,920
$88,000 for my lowest lot

3148
02:30:14,920 --> 02:30:17,760
size this setup

3149
02:30:17,760 --> 02:30:19,240
over

3150
02:30:19,240 --> 02:30:21,880
$88,000 with a six pip stop loss so I'm

3151
02:30:21,880 --> 02:30:23,200
only risking

3152
02:30:23,200 --> 02:30:26,800
600 on this trade and with an 11 pip

3153
02:30:26,800 --> 02:30:29,040
stop loss where I'm only risking 1,000

3154
02:30:29,040 --> 02:30:31,960
but I'm risking a th000 to get 3100 and

3155
02:30:31,960 --> 02:30:36,040
I'm risking 600 to get

3156
02:30:36,040 --> 02:30:39,279
5200 so the risk is still captured in

3157
02:30:39,279 --> 02:30:42,439
all of this but it's just made

3158
02:30:42,439 --> 02:30:44,479
small and it's because you're using

3159
02:30:44,479 --> 02:30:46,960
structural areas where you know

3160
02:30:46,960 --> 02:30:48,319
this is where the banks are hiding their

3161
02:30:48,319 --> 02:30:50,760
stop loss uh this is actually a 12 pip

3162
02:30:50,760 --> 02:30:52,520
stop loss don't want to lie about that

3163
02:30:52,520 --> 02:30:54,000
to you guys next you know somebody make

3164
02:30:54,000 --> 02:30:56,479
a whole YouTube video about me look at

3165
02:30:56,479 --> 02:30:59,680
him he said it was 10 Pips or 11 Pips

3166
02:30:59,680 --> 02:31:01,319
and that was 12 you know like people

3167
02:31:01,319 --> 02:31:03,439
make videos for like the craziest things

3168
02:31:03,439 --> 02:31:05,520
you guys ever saw those ASMR videos they

3169
02:31:05,520 --> 02:31:07,680
be

3170
02:31:11,720 --> 02:31:15,479
like can you hear me and they get like

3171
02:31:15,479 --> 02:31:18,720
millions of views on it just up millions

3172
02:31:18,720 --> 02:31:21,439
of views from

3173
02:31:22,080 --> 02:31:25,359
that out of this world man but this is

3174
02:31:25,359 --> 02:31:28,080
essentially like like how all of it is

3175
02:31:28,080 --> 02:31:30,560
taught find area of

3176
02:31:30,560 --> 02:31:33,000
Interest understand what's going on in

3177
02:31:33,000 --> 02:31:36,279
structure find your setup within that

3178
02:31:36,279 --> 02:31:39,399
area of interest and that's all you

3179
02:31:39,399 --> 02:31:42,640
want first entry is a scalp second entry

3180
02:31:42,640 --> 02:31:44,439
you find a double bottom or a double top

3181
02:31:44,439 --> 02:31:47,680
on it and then you take get to that

3182
02:31:47,680 --> 02:31:51,080
direction and that's it over and over

3183
02:31:51,080 --> 02:31:53,720
and over and over and over it happens

3184
02:31:53,720 --> 02:31:57,040
like clock work over and over again so

3185
02:31:57,040 --> 02:31:59,520
look this tapped into this area

3186
02:31:59,520 --> 02:32:01,800
here and this is how you can comp

3187
02:32:01,800 --> 02:32:03,399
compound your trades

3188
02:32:03,399 --> 02:32:06,479
too this area here was responsible for

3189
02:32:06,479 --> 02:32:09,520
breaking this structure and this above

3190
02:32:09,520 --> 02:32:11,120
so you want to look at the area that's

3191
02:32:11,120 --> 02:32:13,560
responsible for the structural break

3192
02:32:13,560 --> 02:32:18,279
that's this in particular

3193
02:32:18,920 --> 02:32:22,960
so right here forget the wick we tap

3194
02:32:22,960 --> 02:32:24,319
into the

3195
02:32:24,319 --> 02:32:27,960
area and we trade

3196
02:32:30,600 --> 02:32:33,640
higher we trade higher so this is your

3197
02:32:33,640 --> 02:32:35,560
scalp

3198
02:32:35,560 --> 02:32:40,399
here bam up to the snd 21 Pips but now

3199
02:32:40,399 --> 02:32:42,279
you're waiting for price to come back

3200
02:32:42,279 --> 02:32:44,080
and give you another entry on a test of

3201
02:32:44,080 --> 02:32:45,240
this

3202
02:32:45,240 --> 02:32:47,040
manipulation a lot of the times I

3203
02:32:47,040 --> 02:32:49,000
mentioned that if the wick goes below

3204
02:32:49,000 --> 02:32:51,359
the following Wick and pushes back up

3205
02:32:51,359 --> 02:32:53,600
that's a manipulation and you don't want

3206
02:32:53,600 --> 02:32:58,120
to consider that so now what do we do we

3207
02:32:58,120 --> 02:33:01,760
take this to

3208
02:33:01,760 --> 02:33:05,120
this and when price trades above it we

3209
02:33:05,120 --> 02:33:07,680
consider this area potentially being the

3210
02:33:07,680 --> 02:33:11,880
area that price Taps into and goes

3211
02:33:11,880 --> 02:33:18,160
long and what do we get we get that long

3212
02:33:18,720 --> 02:33:21,840
so we get the first scalp

3213
02:33:21,840 --> 02:33:26,439
up we get the the first scalp up

3214
02:33:26,439 --> 02:33:29,399
that's

3215
02:33:29,399 --> 02:33:32,800
here and then we get the long entry here

3216
02:33:32,800 --> 02:33:34,520
to take us up

3217
02:33:34,520 --> 02:33:38,200
to where it went

3218
02:33:38,600 --> 02:33:41,120
here but then

3219
02:33:41,120 --> 02:33:43,720
look we might be breaking structure to

3220
02:33:43,720 --> 02:33:47,399
the downside maybe with this

3221
02:33:47,399 --> 02:33:50,680
Wick so with this Wick coming as low as

3222
02:33:50,680 --> 02:33:51,520
it

3223
02:33:51,520 --> 02:33:55,040
did we could potentially expect price to

3224
02:33:55,040 --> 02:33:58,200
tap back up into either this area or

3225
02:33:58,200 --> 02:34:00,920
here sorry why why is this here what is

3226
02:34:00,920 --> 02:34:05,319
this for oh I have this stupid thing

3227
02:34:05,319 --> 02:34:08,319
on

3228
02:34:09,760 --> 02:34:12,399
yeah all right bye

3229
02:34:12,399 --> 02:34:15,319
now now we potentially get price to tap

3230
02:34:15,319 --> 02:34:17,439
into

3231
02:34:17,439 --> 02:34:20,479
either here where it just

3232
02:34:20,479 --> 02:34:22,040
tapped

3233
02:34:22,040 --> 02:34:23,640
or

3234
02:34:23,640 --> 02:34:26,720
here further

3235
02:34:26,720 --> 02:34:29,439
up so we'll see if we get a tap into

3236
02:34:29,439 --> 02:34:32,319
this and a rejection away from this and

3237
02:34:32,319 --> 02:34:35,319
possibly back down but this move up

3238
02:34:35,319 --> 02:34:38,760
could have been from this minor

3239
02:34:38,760 --> 02:34:41,279
imbalance in here and then we got no

3240
02:34:41,279 --> 02:34:43,000
this could be taken to high because we

3241
02:34:43,000 --> 02:34:44,359
got a tap on this IM balance and it

3242
02:34:44,359 --> 02:34:45,840
pushed up but then we got a double tap

3243
02:34:45,840 --> 02:34:49,560
on it it again so we got we have to um

3244
02:34:49,560 --> 02:34:50,680
make sure that this isn't the

3245
02:34:50,680 --> 02:34:54,399
Candlestick pattern that we usually see

3246
02:34:54,399 --> 02:34:57,080
to trade us higher so we would actually

3247
02:34:57,080 --> 02:34:59,000
want this to be

3248
02:34:59,000 --> 02:35:02,800
broken um to give us some idea that it

3249
02:35:02,800 --> 02:35:04,080
could

3250
02:35:04,080 --> 02:35:06,319
potentially

3251
02:35:06,319 --> 02:35:09,800
um come back down so again remember it's

3252
02:35:09,800 --> 02:35:11,800
either the touch of this it could be the

3253
02:35:11,800 --> 02:35:13,200
touch of this cuz look at this liquidity

3254
02:35:13,200 --> 02:35:15,000
grab

3255
02:35:15,000 --> 02:35:18,000
candle

3256
02:35:18,040 --> 02:35:20,399
right here pushed up above the wick

3257
02:35:20,399 --> 02:35:23,040
traded below

3258
02:35:24,840 --> 02:35:27,800
it but then we just got the test of

3259
02:35:27,800 --> 02:35:30,040
these three candles so let's see what it

3260
02:35:30,040 --> 02:35:32,720
does does it take you up after the test

3261
02:35:32,720 --> 02:35:35,600
or does it short and run the lows and we

3262
02:35:35,600 --> 02:35:37,760
have a run of the low so then this

3263
02:35:37,760 --> 02:35:40,600
rejection

3264
02:35:43,279 --> 02:35:45,479
here is the rejection that we were

3265
02:35:45,479 --> 02:35:48,120
looking for for it to potentially run

3266
02:35:48,120 --> 02:35:50,560
the lows and if this runs this low we

3267
02:35:50,560 --> 02:35:53,000
have to see what it does in this area

3268
02:35:53,000 --> 02:35:54,479
because this could just be running the

3269
02:35:54,479 --> 02:35:57,080
low to come back to the same imbalance

3270
02:35:57,080 --> 02:35:59,920
area testing the imbalance again and

3271
02:35:59,920 --> 02:36:02,520
then trading higher the same way that

3272
02:36:02,520 --> 02:36:06,920
we've been doing the entire time this

3273
02:36:07,680 --> 02:36:11,240
morning Taps into the imbalance here

3274
02:36:11,240 --> 02:36:14,920
pushes up test the imbalance pushes

3275
02:36:14,920 --> 02:36:17,160
further

3276
02:36:17,160 --> 02:36:21,040
test the area that's created here with

3277
02:36:21,040 --> 02:36:23,120
this pushes

3278
02:36:23,120 --> 02:36:25,720
further so now what are we potentially

3279
02:36:25,720 --> 02:36:27,000
looking

3280
02:36:27,000 --> 02:36:30,200
for potentially an area or a test back

3281
02:36:30,200 --> 02:36:32,080
into somewhere

3282
02:36:32,080 --> 02:36:34,920
here and if we get the test back into

3283
02:36:34,920 --> 02:36:37,279
here we could trade higher but if we

3284
02:36:37,279 --> 02:36:41,920
come through this area then we're

3285
02:36:42,640 --> 02:36:44,920
dropping because at that point it would

3286
02:36:44,920 --> 02:36:48,000
be violating major swing points on this

3287
02:36:48,000 --> 02:36:48,920
time

3288
02:36:48,920 --> 02:36:51,359
frame because these are major swing

3289
02:36:51,359 --> 02:36:55,160
points here here

3290
02:36:55,160 --> 02:37:01,040
here here here here

3291
02:37:01,040 --> 02:37:04,479
here here so none of the lows were

3292
02:37:04,479 --> 02:37:07,240
violated as of yet all of these lows are

3293
02:37:07,240 --> 02:37:09,680
still intact so you essentially want to

3294
02:37:09,680 --> 02:37:12,200
wait till one of the major swing points

3295
02:37:12,200 --> 02:37:15,000
are ran and if that's ran then that

3296
02:37:15,000 --> 02:37:16,800
gives you an indication

3297
02:37:16,800 --> 02:37:19,760
that price is going to go bearish out of

3298
02:37:19,760 --> 02:37:22,399
this whole

3299
02:37:22,399 --> 02:37:25,120
area look like a little shank to stab

3300
02:37:25,120 --> 02:37:27,960
somebody with but yeah that that's how

3301
02:37:27,960 --> 02:37:29,160
you know that price is going to go

3302
02:37:29,160 --> 02:37:31,680
bearish out of the area this is

3303
02:37:31,680 --> 02:37:33,640
intermediary structure smaller time

3304
02:37:33,640 --> 02:37:36,240
frame structure so with all of this this

3305
02:37:36,240 --> 02:37:38,840
can easily reverse this can easily be

3306
02:37:38,840 --> 02:37:41,439
broken you know like we don't really

3307
02:37:41,439 --> 02:37:43,560
test our longer trades off of that

3308
02:37:43,560 --> 02:37:45,080
within this area these are just like

3309
02:37:45,080 --> 02:37:47,120
little scalps and

3310
02:37:47,120 --> 02:37:49,760
stuff that that you could potentially

3311
02:37:49,760 --> 02:37:53,600
look to um uh gain some opportunity in

3312
02:37:53,600 --> 02:37:54,960
so I'm wondering you have this hidden

3313
02:37:54,960 --> 02:37:57,680
snd

3314
02:38:02,720 --> 02:38:05,640
here here let's see what price does with

3315
02:38:05,640 --> 02:38:09,479
that could continue

3316
02:38:10,880 --> 02:38:13,479
through could give us another tap into

3317
02:38:13,479 --> 02:38:15,520
this one which would be a double bottom

3318
02:38:15,520 --> 02:38:18,200
into to this this area that it already

3319
02:38:18,200 --> 02:38:20,520
tapped into and then you would expect

3320
02:38:20,520 --> 02:38:22,040
for price to give you a double bottom

3321
02:38:22,040 --> 02:38:25,560
somewhere within here in order to take

3322
02:38:25,560 --> 02:38:29,240
you back up if we were running the high

3323
02:38:29,240 --> 02:38:31,000
so you see how double bottom is a term

3324
02:38:31,000 --> 02:38:34,600
that's used in retail Concepts but if

3325
02:38:34,600 --> 02:38:36,960
they have rules to it they could be way

3326
02:38:36,960 --> 02:38:39,040
more beneficial than trying to get you

3327
02:38:39,040 --> 02:38:41,240
to look for double bottoms and double

3328
02:38:41,240 --> 02:38:43,720
tops now you're looking for structure

3329
02:38:43,720 --> 02:38:45,200
then you're looking for zones and then

3330
02:38:45,200 --> 02:38:46,279
you're looking

3331
02:38:46,279 --> 02:38:50,200
for the double bottom or the double top

3332
02:38:50,200 --> 02:38:52,960
maybe you know within that area you're

3333
02:38:52,960 --> 02:38:54,600
not just trading them because you see

3334
02:38:54,600 --> 02:38:58,720
them all across the board so yeah um

3335
02:38:58,720 --> 02:39:00,319
what do you think about setting up a

3336
02:39:00,319 --> 02:39:02,960
limit at the top black line so it's

3337
02:39:02,960 --> 02:39:05,399
interesting that you mentioned that um

3338
02:39:05,399 --> 02:39:07,720
this is why I don't use limit orders at

3339
02:39:07,720 --> 02:39:10,800
all because withit limits I mean I get

3340
02:39:10,800 --> 02:39:13,160
it you know limits um you know they help

3341
02:39:13,160 --> 02:39:15,720
with the slippage but I don't use limits

3342
02:39:15,720 --> 02:39:17,720
because price is tapping into a

3343
02:39:17,720 --> 02:39:19,600
particular area if I had put a limit

3344
02:39:19,600 --> 02:39:22,000
here and I put my stops behind here or

3345
02:39:22,000 --> 02:39:24,040
even if my stops were behind the Zone up

3346
02:39:24,040 --> 02:39:27,000
here my stop loss still got

3347
02:39:27,000 --> 02:39:29,680
hit if I put a limit

3348
02:39:29,680 --> 02:39:32,000
there that's why when it gets there I

3349
02:39:32,000 --> 02:39:34,720
want to see what is it doing

3350
02:39:34,720 --> 02:39:39,040
here do something for me here that shows

3351
02:39:39,040 --> 02:39:42,439
me that you want to come

3352
02:39:42,439 --> 02:39:46,520
down do something for me

3353
02:39:46,520 --> 02:39:48,560
nothing made her dance

3354
02:39:48,560 --> 02:39:51,960
here so she kept

3355
02:39:51,960 --> 02:39:54,800
climbing little chaa slide through here

3356
02:39:54,800 --> 02:39:56,560
paked you out made you think it was a

3357
02:39:56,560 --> 02:39:58,200
equal

3358
02:39:58,200 --> 02:40:02,319
High nope ye kept

3359
02:40:02,319 --> 02:40:04,800
going and I told you within the equal

3360
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:07,760
High you want an equal High here yes you

3361
02:40:07,760 --> 02:40:10,439
want both highs you know close in the

3362
02:40:10,439 --> 02:40:11,960
range of each other even if one was

3363
02:40:11,960 --> 02:40:14,080
higher than the other you won't both

3364
02:40:14,080 --> 02:40:16,160
close in the area of each other

3365
02:40:16,160 --> 02:40:21,240
but within this right leg here or right

3366
02:40:21,240 --> 02:40:24,840
arm or whatever it's called you want an

3367
02:40:24,840 --> 02:40:28,760
equal High to happen within here as

3368
02:40:28,760 --> 02:40:31,000
well and then that gives you some

3369
02:40:31,000 --> 02:40:34,479
indication that the equal high is going

3370
02:40:34,479 --> 02:40:38,960
down like um let me see if I could

3371
02:40:43,279 --> 02:40:47,800
find so here with within all within here

3372
02:40:47,800 --> 02:40:48,640
you

3373
02:40:48,640 --> 02:40:53,240
have this High put in right here then

3374
02:40:53,240 --> 02:40:56,279
you have this High put in but then you

3375
02:40:56,279 --> 02:41:00,000
still have price just giving you some

3376
02:41:00,000 --> 02:41:03,840
sideways shift from this area but all of

3377
02:41:03,840 --> 02:41:07,200
this still gives you some indication

3378
02:41:07,200 --> 02:41:11,120
that we're potentially um facing some

3379
02:41:11,120 --> 02:41:14,000
resistance so we could go back down tap

3380
02:41:14,000 --> 02:41:18,240
into an area and then continue up but if

3381
02:41:18,240 --> 02:41:22,200
you look there was this equal High

3382
02:41:22,680 --> 02:41:27,160
here sorry there was this equal High

3383
02:41:28,640 --> 02:41:31,160
here but look when price traded up to

3384
02:41:31,160 --> 02:41:33,279
here it gave you this equal high and it

3385
02:41:33,279 --> 02:41:37,240
gave you this equal high so now we have

3386
02:41:37,240 --> 02:41:39,760
three almost equal

3387
02:41:39,760 --> 02:41:43,720
Highs but it's not only three almost

3388
02:41:43,720 --> 02:41:46,279
equal highs that we have

3389
02:41:46,279 --> 02:41:48,960
it's actually

3390
02:41:48,960 --> 02:41:52,680
structure because look at

3391
02:41:56,479 --> 02:41:59,000
this the Candlestick pattern that we

3392
02:41:59,000 --> 02:42:02,680
like to see is present even if you use

3393
02:42:02,680 --> 02:42:04,520
the larger structural one the

3394
02:42:04,520 --> 02:42:06,200
Candlestick pattern is here that we like

3395
02:42:06,200 --> 02:42:07,439
to

3396
02:42:07,439 --> 02:42:09,880
see so because it's here and we like to

3397
02:42:09,880 --> 02:42:12,080
see it it's it's what we like to see

3398
02:42:12,080 --> 02:42:16,240
we're expecting the runs of

3399
02:42:16,240 --> 02:42:20,439
the lows that facilitated this area for

3400
02:42:20,439 --> 02:42:24,120
us and we got a run of every single

3401
02:42:24,120 --> 02:42:29,600
low that facilitated the area from

3402
02:42:29,600 --> 02:42:31,279
this

3403
02:42:31,279 --> 02:42:35,319
here we ran every single low along this

3404
02:42:35,319 --> 02:42:38,720
trend line we ran it tapped into here

3405
02:42:38,720 --> 02:42:39,920
and then

3406
02:42:39,920 --> 02:42:41,920
left and this is what I was talking

3407
02:42:41,920 --> 02:42:44,640
about in terms of of trend lines yeah

3408
02:42:44,640 --> 02:42:46,399
there's people that use use them and and

3409
02:42:46,399 --> 02:42:49,000
some of them are profitable but they're

3410
02:42:49,000 --> 02:42:52,479
essentially just a storage of of

3411
02:42:52,479 --> 02:42:54,600
liquidity essentially that the price

3412
02:42:54,600 --> 02:42:56,800
ends up just running

3413
02:42:56,800 --> 02:42:59,720
later so you know like that's just

3414
02:42:59,720 --> 02:43:01,040
something that that you guys want to pay

3415
02:43:01,040 --> 02:43:03,399
attention to with the limit again I'm

3416
02:43:03,399 --> 02:43:06,840
not setting a limit here because I want

3417
02:43:06,840 --> 02:43:08,880
to see what price does within this area

3418
02:43:08,880 --> 02:43:10,200
before I get

3419
02:43:10,200 --> 02:43:12,560
involved so you see we just had a run of

3420
02:43:12,560 --> 02:43:14,640
this low here we could have a

3421
02:43:14,640 --> 02:43:17,920
retracement back up into this area and

3422
02:43:17,920 --> 02:43:22,000
then a continuation

3423
02:43:22,080 --> 02:43:26,080
down and then this would essentially be

3424
02:43:26,080 --> 02:43:28,760
woff and I say that this would be woff

3425
02:43:28,760 --> 02:43:30,880
because look at this let me just delete

3426
02:43:30,880 --> 02:43:34,080
all of this um maybe to

3427
02:43:34,080 --> 02:43:37,080
here

3428
02:43:37,200 --> 02:43:39,960
yeah this could essentially be W off

3429
02:43:39,960 --> 02:43:43,000
because what would we have if this

3430
02:43:43,000 --> 02:43:47,920
was we have the selling climax the

3431
02:43:47,920 --> 02:43:49,120
automatic

3432
02:43:49,120 --> 02:43:53,800
rally the secondary test the sign of

3433
02:43:53,800 --> 02:43:56,359
weakness we

3434
02:43:56,359 --> 02:44:01,240
have this could be the UT or or or this

3435
02:44:01,240 --> 02:44:04,800
could be the UT within the

3436
02:44:05,279 --> 02:44:09,080
area then we have a

3437
02:44:09,080 --> 02:44:11,880
utad and then if we put in another sign

3438
02:44:11,880 --> 02:44:12,880
of

3439
02:44:12,880 --> 02:44:15,560
weakness the other sign of weakness

3440
02:44:15,560 --> 02:44:18,960
actually usually comes and runs the low

3441
02:44:18,960 --> 02:44:20,680
of the

3442
02:44:20,680 --> 02:44:23,479
AR so we could run the low of the AR

3443
02:44:23,479 --> 02:44:25,680
coming down into here we can come back

3444
02:44:25,680 --> 02:44:28,319
into this area and then that's where the

3445
02:44:28,319 --> 02:44:33,080
final short is within this area and then

3446
02:44:33,080 --> 02:44:36,439
if you scroll out you'll see according

3447
02:44:36,439 --> 02:44:39,200
to you know the the things that we like

3448
02:44:39,200 --> 02:44:42,160
to see of

3449
02:44:44,160 --> 02:44:45,920
course

3450
02:44:45,920 --> 02:44:47,600
you'll

3451
02:44:47,600 --> 02:44:51,000
see price flip below this come back into

3452
02:44:51,000 --> 02:44:53,960
this area and then leave and what is

3453
02:44:53,960 --> 02:44:56,160
that the Candlestick setup that we

3454
02:44:56,160 --> 02:44:57,760
usually

3455
02:44:57,760 --> 02:45:01,479
have so this is how you anticipate those

3456
02:45:01,479 --> 02:45:04,240
moves

3457
02:45:04,240 --> 02:45:07,439
forward uh Monty can you just block this

3458
02:45:07,439 --> 02:45:09,319
person maybe from the chat or something

3459
02:45:09,319 --> 02:45:10,760
like that I don't

3460
02:45:10,760 --> 02:45:14,920
know I don't want any sex okay gez get

3461
02:45:14,920 --> 02:45:17,439
out out of

3462
02:45:19,200 --> 02:45:22,439
here yeah yeah so I I don't know why

3463
02:45:22,439 --> 02:45:24,479
these these spam bot hey bro I had to

3464
02:45:24,479 --> 02:45:26,359
leave the office so I don't know if you

3465
02:45:26,359 --> 02:45:29,359
answer my question earlier um oh yes I

3466
02:45:29,359 --> 02:45:32,319
did I did um uh answer the question I

3467
02:45:32,319 --> 02:45:33,960
believe it was

3468
02:45:33,960 --> 02:45:37,760
um uh

3469
02:45:39,120 --> 02:45:44,080
wait oh no I didn't I I didn't see this

3470
02:45:44,080 --> 02:45:46,240
um

3471
02:45:46,240 --> 02:45:48,680
some oh maybe maybe it was this question

3472
02:45:48,680 --> 02:45:51,760
was it the the break oh no no no you I

3473
02:45:51,760 --> 02:45:53,160
already got to that the break it was

3474
02:45:53,160 --> 02:45:55,640
here okay my bad um at

3475
02:45:55,640 --> 02:45:59,160
29800 got me because with that close I

3476
02:45:59,160 --> 02:46:01,040
was so sure we were going

3477
02:46:01,040 --> 02:46:05,319
lower and and the higher low at

3478
02:46:05,319 --> 02:46:08,640
30151 but the price just left to go up

3479
02:46:08,640 --> 02:46:13,479
is this something that I missed um so

3480
02:46:13,479 --> 02:46:18,000
where where was that again at

3481
02:46:18,279 --> 02:46:21,279
29800

3482
02:46:23,399 --> 02:46:26,160
29800 uh that's what what time frame is

3483
02:46:26,160 --> 02:46:30,399
that the hourly time frame I believe you

3484
02:46:35,520 --> 02:46:38,520
said

3485
02:46:42,279 --> 02:46:47,000
um oh you're talking about down here

3486
02:46:48,120 --> 02:46:50,439
down here you you thought that that with

3487
02:46:50,439 --> 02:46:54,200
down here it was going to continue

3488
02:46:54,200 --> 02:46:57,200
short

3489
02:46:57,319 --> 02:47:01,040
um was sure the market was

3490
02:47:01,040 --> 02:47:04,600
going but the price left me to go up is

3491
02:47:04,600 --> 02:47:06,120
that just the market being the market or

3492
02:47:06,120 --> 02:47:07,760
did I miss something so this was

3493
02:47:07,760 --> 02:47:10,200
essentially the pattern

3494
02:47:10,200 --> 02:47:13,000
um that I usually teach on the Channel

3495
02:47:13,000 --> 02:47:13,920
with

3496
02:47:13,920 --> 02:47:15,800
here

3497
02:47:15,800 --> 02:47:19,680
this pattern and and the rules um that

3498
02:47:19,680 --> 02:47:23,560
are laid out uh for uh this particular

3499
02:47:23,560 --> 02:47:27,080
pattern um so you're looking

3500
02:47:27,080 --> 02:47:29,880
for

3501
02:47:29,880 --> 02:47:34,560
this this looks like it came up

3502
02:47:35,720 --> 02:47:38,680
here uh actually let me look and see let

3503
02:47:38,680 --> 02:47:41,120
this looks this looks weird I see what

3504
02:47:41,120 --> 02:47:43,200
you're saying

3505
02:47:43,200 --> 02:47:46,479
um just go down into to the bottom of

3506
02:47:46,479 --> 02:47:52,920
it and take a look um okay

3507
02:47:55,640 --> 02:47:58,000
so so here's where the different types

3508
02:47:58,000 --> 02:48:00,200
of structures come into play we put in

3509
02:48:00,200 --> 02:48:01,840
this

3510
02:48:01,840 --> 02:48:06,200
low we come up we put in this

3511
02:48:07,160 --> 02:48:11,479
High since this is the hourly time frame

3512
02:48:11,479 --> 02:48:13,800
you want to see

3513
02:48:13,800 --> 02:48:18,319
um you know the the larger

3514
02:48:18,319 --> 02:48:20,920
swings but you also want to consider

3515
02:48:20,920 --> 02:48:24,520
Candlestick structure so this puts in a

3516
02:48:24,520 --> 02:48:26,960
new low

3517
02:48:26,960 --> 02:48:31,720
here then trades above comes back in the

3518
02:48:31,720 --> 02:48:34,279
area comes back down here so what we

3519
02:48:34,279 --> 02:48:36,920
would do here since this is the hourly

3520
02:48:36,920 --> 02:48:39,120
time frame I would be using Candlestick

3521
02:48:39,120 --> 02:48:41,960
structure um in here I wouldn't be

3522
02:48:41,960 --> 02:48:44,040
trading from the hourly I would more so

3523
02:48:44,040 --> 02:48:46,560
be trading from from

3524
02:48:46,560 --> 02:48:50,000
um you know this this particular time

3525
02:48:50,000 --> 02:48:53,359
frame uh the 1 minute time frame but if

3526
02:48:53,359 --> 02:48:55,840
I saw that it was an hourly move then I

3527
02:48:55,840 --> 02:48:59,120
would understand that but look I talk

3528
02:48:59,120 --> 02:49:02,319
about the v-shape recoveries that people

3529
02:49:02,319 --> 02:49:07,560
tend to see you see this here

3530
02:49:07,560 --> 02:49:10,720
um this is just a liquidity

3531
02:49:10,720 --> 02:49:12,399
grab

3532
02:49:12,399 --> 02:49:16,800
this so we're down here we're

3533
02:49:16,800 --> 02:49:21,439
making you know a this is a a lower low

3534
02:49:21,439 --> 02:49:26,160
lower high lower low lower high lower

3535
02:49:26,160 --> 02:49:28,000
low and then it just pushes you out of

3536
02:49:28,000 --> 02:49:30,239
the area so you're trying to figure out

3537
02:49:30,239 --> 02:49:33,120
what exactly happened here because price

3538
02:49:33,120 --> 02:49:37,319
didn't trade above it put in a a low it

3539
02:49:37,319 --> 02:49:40,479
put in a lower low um but if you look

3540
02:49:40,479 --> 02:49:43,000
within

3541
02:49:43,720 --> 02:49:46,720
here

3542
02:49:49,319 --> 02:49:51,040
down within this

3543
02:49:51,040 --> 02:49:54,040
area

3544
02:49:54,319 --> 02:49:59,200
here we actually have the same issue

3545
02:49:59,200 --> 02:50:01,560
where we look like we're

3546
02:50:01,560 --> 02:50:05,680
making the the movements in

3547
02:50:06,600 --> 02:50:10,120
price within

3548
02:50:10,920 --> 02:50:13,920
here we get a lower high we come into

3549
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:16,319
the area and and then we leave but this

3550
02:50:16,319 --> 02:50:18,080
is why I also teach Candlestick

3551
02:50:18,080 --> 02:50:20,439
structure because Candlestick structure

3552
02:50:20,439 --> 02:50:23,640
would have gotten you into this trade if

3553
02:50:23,640 --> 02:50:26,880
the intermediary structure

3554
02:50:26,880 --> 02:50:31,120
didn't right here so we begin

3555
02:50:31,120 --> 02:50:36,000
to make our Ascension down into the area

3556
02:50:36,000 --> 02:50:38,040
when we get to the area we're putting in

3557
02:50:38,040 --> 02:50:39,560
a series

3558
02:50:39,560 --> 02:50:44,040
of lower lows lower highs we run this

3559
02:50:44,040 --> 02:50:47,760
high we trade back into the range of it

3560
02:50:47,760 --> 02:50:49,160
and then we

3561
02:50:49,160 --> 02:50:52,600
leave but when this happens we need to

3562
02:50:52,600 --> 02:50:54,640
make sure on the

3563
02:50:54,640 --> 02:50:57,800
hourly this is happening in an area of

3564
02:50:57,800 --> 02:51:00,359
interest to the left side so let me

3565
02:51:00,359 --> 02:51:02,560
actually check and see where what is

3566
02:51:02,560 --> 02:51:03,920
this

3567
02:51:03,920 --> 02:51:06,920
um

3568
02:51:07,920 --> 02:51:10,239
29700 let's see if there's

3569
02:51:10,239 --> 02:51:13,560
any area back here at

3570
02:51:13,560 --> 02:51:16,560
29700

3571
02:51:22,200 --> 02:51:24,040
so that's

3572
02:51:24,040 --> 02:51:27,359
here we have this Gap in here we have

3573
02:51:27,359 --> 02:51:30,319
this this candle that pushed down and

3574
02:51:30,319 --> 02:51:32,960
pulled up and look price never came back

3575
02:51:32,960 --> 02:51:35,439
to mitigate the area so now this is a

3576
02:51:35,439 --> 02:51:37,720
likely area to be mitigated because when

3577
02:51:37,720 --> 02:51:39,720
price traded above it never came back to

3578
02:51:39,720 --> 02:51:41,840
touch it just like the area that you

3579
02:51:41,840 --> 02:51:44,239
were faked out on price never came back

3580
02:51:44,239 --> 02:51:47,399
to touch touch that area until later on

3581
02:51:47,399 --> 02:51:52,399
so all you do is take this area

3582
02:52:02,319 --> 02:52:06,840
here you might base your entry

3583
02:52:09,319 --> 02:52:13,479
there you might put a stop loss

3584
02:52:13,479 --> 02:52:16,479
there

3585
02:52:25,920 --> 02:52:29,720
dang this thing is scrolling forever so

3586
02:52:29,720 --> 02:52:32,080
look at

3587
02:52:33,120 --> 02:52:35,760
this you get a tap on the beginning of

3588
02:52:35,760 --> 02:52:37,600
the area or is this the middle of the

3589
02:52:37,600 --> 02:52:39,840
area this might be the middle of the

3590
02:52:39,840 --> 02:52:44,040
area but this liquidity grab down is

3591
02:52:44,040 --> 02:52:47,279
into to the wick of the candle that's

3592
02:52:47,279 --> 02:52:48,359
over

3593
02:52:48,359 --> 02:52:52,600
there so now it becomes that oh sorry I

3594
02:52:52,600 --> 02:52:55,200
don't know what happened there my bad

3595
02:52:55,200 --> 02:52:57,439
now it

3596
02:52:57,439 --> 02:53:00,319
becomes

3597
02:53:00,319 --> 02:53:04,000
that this Wick was manipulation down and

3598
02:53:04,000 --> 02:53:08,239
they left this hidden snd Zone

3599
02:53:08,840 --> 02:53:11,800
here so now the actual

3600
02:53:11,800 --> 02:53:16,600
entry is here at the hidden snd

3601
02:53:16,600 --> 02:53:19,920
Zone I don't know what this this this

3602
02:53:19,920 --> 02:53:22,960
spam thing uh let me let me see if I can

3603
02:53:22,960 --> 02:53:27,960
go and block this um this particular U

3604
02:53:27,960 --> 02:53:30,960
page

3605
02:53:43,359 --> 02:53:45,840
um

3606
02:53:45,840 --> 02:53:49,160
let me just report

3607
02:53:49,880 --> 02:53:53,880

3608

spam where

3609
02:54:12,279 --> 02:54:16,040
is Amani can you comment in the

3610
02:54:16,040 --> 02:54:20,000
chat as well as um aim comment on on

3611
02:54:20,000 --> 02:54:24,160
YouTube so I can just give you guys a

3612
02:54:24,160 --> 02:54:28,000
um a moderator

3613
02:54:33,439 --> 02:54:35,720
role yeah because these things and and

3614
02:54:35,720 --> 02:54:36,920
this is what I'm talking about in terms

3615
02:54:36,920 --> 02:54:39,520
of the Discord like this will happen

3616
02:54:39,520 --> 02:54:42,800
over and over again um in a Discord if

3617
02:54:42,800 --> 02:54:44,960
if there aren't those tiers

3618
02:54:44,960 --> 02:54:48,080
so um that's essentially why um you know

3619
02:54:48,080 --> 02:54:50,120
like we have to switch up the model it's

3620
02:54:50,120 --> 02:54:51,560
not going to be the same way we wanted

3621
02:54:51,560 --> 02:54:54,200
it to be but um we definitely had to

3622
02:54:54,200 --> 02:54:56,680
switch it so look this tapped into the

3623
02:54:56,680 --> 02:55:00,040
hidden snd to the left um if if you're

3624
02:55:00,040 --> 02:55:02,680
still here um uh Alfredo this tapped

3625
02:55:02,680 --> 02:55:05,200
into the hidden snd to the left so the

3626
02:55:05,200 --> 02:55:11,239
hidden snd was uh you know IC um no um I

3627
02:55:11,239 --> 02:55:13,880
I watched like maybe two of his videos

3628
02:55:13,880 --> 02:55:15,840
um I know he knows what he's talking

3629
02:55:15,840 --> 02:55:17,960
about but because of like the the little

3630
02:55:17,960 --> 02:55:20,800
tangents and some sometimes he goes on

3631
02:55:20,800 --> 02:55:23,960
um it's really difficult to um like be

3632
02:55:23,960 --> 02:55:25,840
able to

3633
02:55:25,840 --> 02:55:28,880
um you know like keep up with some of it

3634
02:55:28,880 --> 02:55:30,640
cuz he goes onto his his little Rants

3635
02:55:30,640 --> 02:55:32,200
and stuff but he definitely knows what

3636
02:55:32,200 --> 02:55:34,319
he's talking about I know that for a

3637
02:55:34,319 --> 02:55:36,200
fact like he knows what he's talking

3638
02:55:36,200 --> 02:55:38,800
about he understands the algorithm but

3639
02:55:38,800 --> 02:55:40,520
some people can't just really keep up

3640
02:55:40,520 --> 02:55:44,000
with the the Rants and stuff so um but

3641
02:55:44,000 --> 02:55:47,160
he's he's good at what he does yes he is

3642
02:55:47,160 --> 02:55:48,600
uh yeah I'm familiar with the

3643
02:55:48,600 --> 02:55:50,560
Candlestick structure but I always

3644
02:55:50,560 --> 02:55:52,520
believe that Candlestick structure is

3645
02:55:52,520 --> 02:55:55,880
most valid on the one hour and above

3646
02:55:55,880 --> 02:55:58,239
yeah it it is valid on the it is more

3647
02:55:58,239 --> 02:56:01,399
valid on the higher time frames but also

3648
02:56:01,399 --> 02:56:03,359
remember we took this area this

3649
02:56:03,359 --> 02:56:05,200
liquidity grab towards the left this is

3650
02:56:05,200 --> 02:56:06,880
from the same time frame you're trading

3651
02:56:06,880 --> 02:56:10,399
from the hourly so I would find an area

3652
02:56:10,399 --> 02:56:13,399
of Interest first we tap into the area

3653
02:56:13,399 --> 02:56:14,640
of Interest

3654
02:56:14,640 --> 02:56:18,239
we go to the lowerer time frames now

3655
02:56:18,239 --> 02:56:21,040
that we're in the area of Interest what

3656
02:56:21,040 --> 02:56:23,680
are we looking for the same type of

3657
02:56:23,680 --> 02:56:27,399
setup to happen here so now that we're

3658
02:56:27,399 --> 02:56:30,560
we're in our area we find the liquidity

3659
02:56:30,560 --> 02:56:33,840
grab down this is the same liquidity

3660
02:56:33,840 --> 02:56:36,560
grab within this area we have price

3661
02:56:36,560 --> 02:56:40,560
shift up above this high this last high

3662
02:56:40,560 --> 02:56:43,520
that was put in we get a tap into this

3663
02:56:43,520 --> 02:56:46,080
area here

3664
02:56:47,160 --> 02:56:51,239
here we put our stops right behind

3665
02:56:51,239 --> 02:56:54,200
here and then we look

3666
02:56:54,200 --> 02:56:57,960
for the hourly move that we find that

3667
02:56:57,960 --> 02:57:00,479
that we found this this particular thing

3668
02:57:00,479 --> 02:57:02,239
on and whether we think it's coming up

3669
02:57:02,239 --> 02:57:04,040
to the imbalance whether we think it's

3670
02:57:04,040 --> 02:57:05,960
just going to run the high or whatever

3671
02:57:05,960 --> 02:57:09,279
it is we found the area to the left

3672
02:57:09,279 --> 02:57:12,640
already we found this area on

3673
02:57:12,640 --> 02:57:16,120
um on the charts we found the hidden snd

3674
02:57:16,120 --> 02:57:17,399
cuz I told you there's always these

3675
02:57:17,399 --> 02:57:19,920
hidden snds that's around that makes us

3676
02:57:19,920 --> 02:57:21,640
think that price is going to run the low

3677
02:57:21,640 --> 02:57:23,640
because we pay attention to these Wicks

3678
02:57:23,640 --> 02:57:25,040
it's like oh yeah if it goes below the

3679
02:57:25,040 --> 02:57:27,200
wick then or it might go down and fill

3680
02:57:27,200 --> 02:57:29,720
the wick nope ye hit the middle of it

3681
02:57:29,720 --> 02:57:31,960
and then just went right

3682
02:57:31,960 --> 02:57:35,080
up to it but if you saw it on on your

3683
02:57:35,080 --> 02:57:37,000
time frame that you trade on now you

3684
02:57:37,000 --> 02:57:38,600
just go to the lower time frame to find

3685
02:57:38,600 --> 02:57:41,560
the entry and you have a 32 pip stop and

3686
02:57:41,560 --> 02:57:43,600
now you're potentially targeting you

3687
02:57:43,600 --> 02:57:46,239
know some some area above here from

3688
02:57:46,239 --> 02:57:49,319
finding your entry on the the um the one

3689
02:57:49,319 --> 02:57:53,040
minute reflective of the 1 hour and look

3690
02:57:53,040 --> 02:57:55,000
then you just

3691
02:57:55,000 --> 02:57:57,040
climb and it

3692
02:57:57,040 --> 02:58:00,680
becomes a smaller time frame move a

3693
02:58:00,680 --> 02:58:03,319
smaller time frame entry with a longer

3694
02:58:03,319 --> 02:58:06,600
time frame move and now you're risking

3695
02:58:06,600 --> 02:58:11,239
or I would be risking $3,900 to make

3696
02:58:11,239 --> 02:58:13,600
$94,000 and that's how the hourly would

3697
02:58:13,600 --> 02:58:16,239
play out for me if I was forecasting my

3698
02:58:16,239 --> 02:58:19,160
trades from you know beforehand like

3699
02:58:19,160 --> 02:58:21,080
from the higher time frames but because

3700
02:58:21,080 --> 02:58:22,920
I could see things in every time frame I

3701
02:58:22,920 --> 02:58:25,760
really don't you know care much

3702
02:58:25,760 --> 02:58:28,760
about um the higher time frames because

3703
02:58:28,760 --> 02:58:30,760
I can see everything on the one minute

3704
02:58:30,760 --> 02:58:33,479
or or most things I could see on the one

3705
02:58:33,479 --> 02:58:36,439
minute um so

3706
02:58:36,439 --> 02:58:38,640
yeah look we might be getting that

3707
02:58:38,640 --> 02:58:40,479
formation of the Candlestick pattern we

3708
02:58:40,479 --> 02:58:42,080
like to

3709
02:58:42,080 --> 02:58:45,880
see here

3710
02:58:45,880 --> 02:58:49,080
we might be getting that but look we we

3711
02:58:49,080 --> 02:58:51,040
almost got it here it looks like we

3712
02:58:51,040 --> 02:58:52,520
almost got it

3713
02:58:52,520 --> 02:58:55,080
here so what happened with

3714
02:58:55,080 --> 02:58:58,760
it and we tapped into this snd and then

3715
02:58:58,760 --> 02:59:01,239
started to trade back above we were

3716
02:59:01,239 --> 02:59:04,319
actually supposed to run the low first

3717
02:59:04,319 --> 02:59:07,600
and then trade above so because this low

3718
02:59:07,600 --> 02:59:08,760
was left

3719
02:59:08,760 --> 02:59:11,760
intact then we're still looking for it

3720
02:59:11,760 --> 02:59:14,520
to continue

3721
02:59:14,520 --> 02:59:17,319
because a low wasn't violated on this

3722
02:59:17,319 --> 02:59:19,040
time frame we have to have a violation

3723
02:59:19,040 --> 02:59:21,960
of the low first and then we pull back

3724
02:59:21,960 --> 02:59:25,640
into the area and then go so that's

3725
02:59:25,640 --> 02:59:28,880
usually um um the the requirements that

3726
02:59:28,880 --> 02:59:33,120
I have for even utilizing a a bullish or

3727
02:59:33,120 --> 02:59:36,479
or bearish flip um so hidden snd zones

3728
02:59:36,479 --> 02:59:39,640
are basically unmitigated areas yes

3729
02:59:39,640 --> 02:59:42,560
that's that's all they are unmitigated

3730
02:59:42,560 --> 02:59:46,439
areas but they're hidden the areas that

3731
02:59:46,439 --> 02:59:48,720
obviously it's it's not like look this

3732
02:59:48,720 --> 02:59:51,520
here this Wick here this is a hidden snd

3733
02:59:51,520 --> 02:59:53,439
zone so this may go up and flip the high

3734
02:59:53,439 --> 02:59:55,760
soon because of this area here but it

3735
02:59:55,760 --> 02:59:57,439
might just be going to tap into this

3736
02:59:57,439 --> 03:00:00,399
area if it doesn't hold at this area it

3737
03:00:00,399 --> 03:00:03,160
could flip the high but this is

3738
03:00:03,160 --> 03:00:05,720
essentially it this one Wick here this

3739
03:00:05,720 --> 03:00:09,800
long Wick that you see manipulation cuz

3740
03:00:09,800 --> 03:00:11,479
look we have price tap right back into

3741
03:00:11,479 --> 03:00:14,319
it and go all this becomes is an snd

3742
03:00:14,319 --> 03:00:17,279
Zone

3743
03:00:18,840 --> 03:00:21,359
here and all we're getting is our

3744
03:00:21,359 --> 03:00:25,399
Candlestick pattern inside of the snd

3745
03:00:25,399 --> 03:00:29,359
Zone The Hidden snd

3746
03:00:29,640 --> 03:00:31,880
Zone that's all we're getting within

3747
03:00:31,880 --> 03:00:33,760
here is this and yeah this could push up

3748
03:00:33,760 --> 03:00:35,520
above here come back into the area to

3749
03:00:35,520 --> 03:00:36,560
test it and

3750
03:00:36,560 --> 03:00:40,040
leave and then go up and potentially run

3751
03:00:40,040 --> 03:00:42,479
the high that could possibly happen or

3752
03:00:42,479 --> 03:00:45,279
it just just go straight up and run

3753
03:00:45,279 --> 03:00:48,080
but we had a hidden Zone and we watch

3754
03:00:48,080 --> 03:00:50,720
this happen within our hidden

3755
03:00:50,720 --> 03:00:55,279
Zone So within the hidden Zone they're

3756
03:00:55,279 --> 03:00:58,160
actually making their me their next move

3757
03:00:58,160 --> 03:01:02,080
in here meanwhile you believe not you

3758
03:01:02,080 --> 03:01:04,760
but but retail Traders meanwhile we

3759
03:01:04,760 --> 03:01:08,760
believe that this is just ranging this

3760
03:01:08,760 --> 03:01:11,000
is

3761
03:01:11,880 --> 03:01:14,880
consolidation we think that this is

3762
03:01:14,880 --> 03:01:16,880
consolidation and guess who looks like

3763
03:01:16,880 --> 03:01:18,720
the clown we

3764
03:01:18,720 --> 03:01:21,840
do because it's not consolidation I mean

3765
03:01:21,840 --> 03:01:26,040
it is consolidation but it's not

3766
03:01:26,040 --> 03:01:28,319
consolidation as in like ranging we

3767
03:01:28,319 --> 03:01:30,000
can't trade that you should stay out of

3768
03:01:30,000 --> 03:01:32,560
areas of consolidation blah blah blah no

3769
03:01:32,560 --> 03:01:33,880
anybody who tells you that doesn't know

3770
03:01:33,880 --> 03:01:36,200
what they're doing there's no such thing

3771
03:01:36,200 --> 03:01:38,800
consolidation tells us the story we need

3772
03:01:38,800 --> 03:01:41,439
consolidation to happen in order to tell

3773
03:01:41,439 --> 03:01:43,439
us what the next direction is going to

3774
03:01:43,439 --> 03:01:45,640
be

3775
03:01:45,960 --> 03:01:47,520
and I talk about the Candlestick pattern

3776
03:01:47,520 --> 03:01:49,399
happening within this snd if you don't

3777
03:01:49,399 --> 03:01:55,520
believe me uh here we go we put in this

3778
03:01:55,800 --> 03:01:58,960
low we put in this High we put in this

3779
03:01:58,960 --> 03:02:02,200
low we put in this High we put in this

3780
03:02:02,200 --> 03:02:05,720
low we run this high with this

3781
03:02:05,720 --> 03:02:08,920
Candlestick we run it we come back into

3782
03:02:08,920 --> 03:02:12,560
the area of the area that we violated we

3783
03:02:12,560 --> 03:02:15,319
come back into this area and then what

3784
03:02:15,319 --> 03:02:17,479
do we do we trade

3785
03:02:17,479 --> 03:02:21,040
out and what is it in the hidden area

3786
03:02:21,040 --> 03:02:24,479
that we have we have the Candlestick

3787
03:02:24,479 --> 03:02:27,720
structure that we like to see and then

3788
03:02:27,720 --> 03:02:30,359
if this continues to trade higher or if

3789
03:02:30,359 --> 03:02:31,800
it does trade

3790
03:02:31,800 --> 03:02:34,319
higher we could have it come back within

3791
03:02:34,319 --> 03:02:37,160
the area to test the Candlestick

3792
03:02:37,160 --> 03:02:40,080
structure that we put here we could test

3793
03:02:40,080 --> 03:02:42,800
it and then leave and create another

3794
03:02:42,800 --> 03:02:44,080
high

3795
03:02:44,080 --> 03:02:48,359
potentially if this area did not do its

3796
03:02:48,359 --> 03:02:50,960
job which I mentioned that we could come

3797
03:02:50,960 --> 03:02:54,239
back up to this area um earlier before

3798
03:02:54,239 --> 03:02:55,640
all of this

3799
03:02:55,640 --> 03:02:58,080
was I think I had mentioned remember it

3800
03:02:58,080 --> 03:02:59,000
was

3801
03:02:59,000 --> 03:03:01,439
here I said that we got the tap here to

3802
03:03:01,439 --> 03:03:03,640
go down but price can return to the area

3803
03:03:03,640 --> 03:03:05,800
a second

3804
03:03:05,800 --> 03:03:09,319
time so then it could be this candle

3805
03:03:09,319 --> 03:03:11,239
that potentially was

3806
03:03:11,239 --> 03:03:15,319
hit which that's what it is is this

3807
03:03:15,319 --> 03:03:17,680
candle so we have an imbalance between

3808
03:03:17,680 --> 03:03:18,960
here so watch it this could be an

3809
03:03:18,960 --> 03:03:21,840
imbalance tap only to trade higher or we

3810
03:03:21,840 --> 03:03:23,680
can just run through it and come back

3811
03:03:23,680 --> 03:03:26,359
down to the untested area here or we can

3812
03:03:26,359 --> 03:03:28,560
just run through this area too if this

3813
03:03:28,560 --> 03:03:30,279
is not the area that price wants to stop

3814
03:03:30,279 --> 03:03:32,000
in you know like there's a bunch of

3815
03:03:32,000 --> 03:03:34,479
possibilities with all these different

3816
03:03:34,479 --> 03:03:36,359
things all these different time frames

3817
03:03:36,359 --> 03:03:39,040
all like a bunch of different

3818
03:03:39,040 --> 03:03:40,920
possibilities and this is why I take

3819
03:03:40,920 --> 03:03:43,600
time to teach live because I know

3820
03:03:43,600 --> 03:03:45,640
everybody else Lolly gags and chats and

3821
03:03:45,640 --> 03:03:47,040
talks about all these different things

3822
03:03:47,040 --> 03:03:49,720
which I go into my tangents too but they

3823
03:03:49,720 --> 03:03:51,560
not give you any real information real

3824
03:03:51,560 --> 03:03:53,600
substance for you to take with you when

3825
03:03:53,600 --> 03:03:56,200
they log off just like yeah that was a

3826
03:03:56,200 --> 03:03:58,880
great chat join the

3827
03:03:58,880 --> 03:04:01,080
mentorship okay you know like it's not

3828
03:04:01,080 --> 03:04:04,600
really teaching you anything um again

3829
03:04:04,600 --> 03:04:06,359
this this teaching I've never seen it

3830
03:04:06,359 --> 03:04:09,080
anywhere ever in my life and it's it's

3831
03:04:09,080 --> 03:04:11,000
me teaching it so yes I I get that it

3832
03:04:11,000 --> 03:04:13,479
sounds bias but I've never seen a

3833
03:04:13,479 --> 03:04:14,800
anywhere in my

3834
03:04:14,800 --> 03:04:18,640
life anywhere like nobody you know

3835
03:04:18,640 --> 03:04:21,399
taught me this nobody like like nothing

3836
03:04:21,399 --> 03:04:23,479
at all I've never seen this I've seen

3837
03:04:23,479 --> 03:04:25,600
some people teach some of these Concepts

3838
03:04:25,600 --> 03:04:26,479
Stand

3839
03:04:26,479 --> 03:04:30,680
Alone um but nothing as comprehensive as

3840
03:04:30,680 --> 03:04:33,359
as essentially you know what I teach

3841
03:04:33,359 --> 03:04:36,960
here nothing as

3842
03:04:38,279 --> 03:04:41,760
comprehensive so this area this push

3843
03:04:41,760 --> 03:04:44,000
above was just that we hit this

3844
03:04:44,000 --> 03:04:46,800
imbalance and had this push up but what

3845
03:04:46,800 --> 03:04:49,120
are we having here what do we look like

3846
03:04:49,120 --> 03:04:52,000
is going on here right now I told you

3847
03:04:52,000 --> 03:04:56,080
when we come up into an area of an equal

3848
03:04:56,080 --> 03:04:59,319
High we also want to see an equal High

3849
03:04:59,319 --> 03:05:01,279
happen

3850
03:05:01,279 --> 03:05:03,880
towards the right side of that area but

3851
03:05:03,880 --> 03:05:05,760
we want to watch this because this is an

3852
03:05:05,760 --> 03:05:07,920
imbalance here and this is the

3853
03:05:07,920 --> 03:05:09,399
Candlestick structure that we like to

3854
03:05:09,399 --> 03:05:12,720
see just happen within the imbalance so

3855
03:05:12,720 --> 03:05:15,160
this

3856
03:05:15,160 --> 03:05:18,560
gives a a little more like areas like

3857
03:05:18,560 --> 03:05:20,840
this give a little more hesitancy for me

3858
03:05:20,840 --> 03:05:24,279
for take to take a longer trade out

3859
03:05:24,279 --> 03:05:28,439
because of that particular thing um is

3860
03:05:28,439 --> 03:05:30,840
the Candlestick structure the

3861
03:05:30,840 --> 03:05:33,319
engulfing uh or any relevant pattern

3862
03:05:33,319 --> 03:05:35,439
tweezer

3863
03:05:35,439 --> 03:05:39,439
tops um just confirming that I'm

3864
03:05:39,439 --> 03:05:41,080
understanding correctly so the

3865
03:05:41,080 --> 03:05:44,279
Candlestick pattern is essentially a

3866
03:05:44,279 --> 03:05:46,640
series of highs and lows being created

3867
03:05:46,640 --> 03:05:49,640
with just the Wicks of the candles alone

3868
03:05:49,640 --> 03:05:51,880
or the bodies of the candles but the

3869
03:05:51,880 --> 03:05:53,920
pattern that I'm talking about is

3870
03:05:53,920 --> 03:05:57,080
essentially that it's it has rules to it

3871
03:05:57,080 --> 03:05:59,720
it has to run a previous high and then

3872
03:05:59,720 --> 03:06:03,040
tap back into the area and then

3873
03:06:03,040 --> 03:06:07,040
go so I I call it Candlestick structure

3874
03:06:07,040 --> 03:06:10,840
Candlestick patterns but it's usually

3875
03:06:10,840 --> 03:06:14,279
that um you see correct they give you

3876
03:06:14,279 --> 03:06:17,359
motivational speeches but most no

3877
03:06:17,359 --> 03:06:21,399
substance yeah exactly it's it's not

3878
03:06:21,399 --> 03:06:23,840
nothing nothing behind exactly what it

3879
03:06:23,840 --> 03:06:27,120
is that that

3880
03:06:27,120 --> 03:06:30,120
um that's like the reason why price does

3881
03:06:30,120 --> 03:06:32,160
this or why price does that so you

3882
03:06:32,160 --> 03:06:33,920
mention what an imbalance is let me just

3883
03:06:33,920 --> 03:06:37,319
take you here um remove some of this

3884
03:06:37,319 --> 03:06:38,399
price

3885
03:06:38,399 --> 03:06:40,600
action

3886
03:06:40,600 --> 03:06:42,200
here

3887
03:06:42,200 --> 03:06:45,200
um

3888
03:06:48,120 --> 03:06:50,160
yeah that that's that very well could be

3889
03:06:50,160 --> 03:06:52,720
it a third trend line touch and then

3890
03:06:52,720 --> 03:06:56,359
likely be broken by um the liquidity

3891
03:06:56,359 --> 03:06:58,840
yeah that could happen but again since

3892
03:06:58,840 --> 03:07:01,439
we're scalping like you know a lot of

3893
03:07:01,439 --> 03:07:03,760
the times those quick moves are the

3894
03:07:03,760 --> 03:07:05,600
scalps and then the longer move we want

3895
03:07:05,600 --> 03:07:08,600
to reassess what that possibly is what

3896
03:07:08,600 --> 03:07:11,120
could possibly be happening you know we

3897
03:07:11,120 --> 03:07:15,120
just want to reassess that

3898
03:07:18,200 --> 03:07:21,720
um let me

3899
03:07:24,479 --> 03:07:26,600
actually yeah all

3900
03:07:26,600 --> 03:07:30,640
right slim is there okay cool um slim I

3901
03:07:30,640 --> 03:07:32,680
just made you a moderator just in case

3902
03:07:32,680 --> 03:07:36,279
um you you have those spam stuff coming

3903
03:07:36,279 --> 03:07:37,680
through or anybody that gets on your

3904
03:07:37,680 --> 03:07:39,239
nerves you could remove them no I'm

3905
03:07:39,239 --> 03:07:41,520
kidding but uh yeah I just made you a

3906
03:07:41,520 --> 03:07:42,760
moderator just so you can help out with

3907
03:07:42,760 --> 03:07:45,840
that I hope that's okay brother um but

3908
03:07:45,840 --> 03:07:49,040
an imbalance is between three Wicks I

3909
03:07:49,040 --> 03:07:50,720
mean three candles sorry you have this

3910
03:07:50,720 --> 03:07:52,239
candle you have this candle and you have

3911
03:07:52,239 --> 03:07:54,279
this

3912
03:07:54,279 --> 03:07:57,120
candle with this candle here it closes

3913
03:07:57,120 --> 03:08:01,000
this candle opens and this candle goes

3914
03:08:01,000 --> 03:08:03,600
engulfing up into this

3915
03:08:03,600 --> 03:08:06,399
area so you had some buys here that

3916
03:08:06,399 --> 03:08:09,920
turned into cells and you had some cells

3917
03:08:09,920 --> 03:08:13,520
here that flipped and turned into buys

3918
03:08:13,520 --> 03:08:17,120
so between this Wick

3919
03:08:17,120 --> 03:08:21,160
here and this Wick here sorry maybe I

3920
03:08:21,160 --> 03:08:23,960
could find like a better a better way

3921
03:08:23,960 --> 03:08:27,399
to let me just use this between this

3922
03:08:27,399 --> 03:08:29,720
Wick

3923
03:08:33,080 --> 03:08:37,000
here and this Wick

3924
03:08:42,000 --> 03:08:44,560
here

3925
03:08:44,560 --> 03:08:48,080
there's this area this gap between

3926
03:08:48,080 --> 03:08:51,040
here this this Wick and this Wick

3927
03:08:51,040 --> 03:08:54,239
they're not touching from either side so

3928
03:08:54,239 --> 03:08:57,040
there's this Gap in between here this

3929
03:08:57,040 --> 03:08:59,040
Gap is called the

3930
03:08:59,040 --> 03:09:02,200
imbalance or inefficiency or fair value

3931
03:09:02,200 --> 03:09:04,720
Gap or IPA whatever they want to call it

3932
03:09:04,720 --> 03:09:06,279
it's all the same thing

3933
03:09:06,279 --> 03:09:09,840
imbalance so this is an imbalance what

3934
03:09:09,840 --> 03:09:12,000
we expect price to do often times with

3935
03:09:12,000 --> 03:09:14,160
these imbalances is for price to come

3936
03:09:14,160 --> 03:09:18,319
back into this area tap into the area

3937
03:09:18,319 --> 03:09:20,960
and then leave or it can just give us a

3938
03:09:20,960 --> 03:09:22,640
quick reaction as a scalp maybe a

3939
03:09:22,640 --> 03:09:27,040
long-term move whatever it is so we take

3940
03:09:27,040 --> 03:09:30,680
this entire area

3941
03:09:30,680 --> 03:09:34,160
from this Wick to this

3942
03:09:34,160 --> 03:09:38,479
Wick let me actually just do

3943
03:09:38,560 --> 03:09:41,520
this we take this area here and we're

3944
03:09:41,520 --> 03:09:43,399
expecting price to tap back back into

3945
03:09:43,399 --> 03:09:45,560
this area and then give us a trade

3946
03:09:45,560 --> 03:09:47,960
coming out of it the first tap usually

3947
03:09:47,960 --> 03:09:51,040
is a scalp the second tap is the longer

3948
03:09:51,040 --> 03:09:53,200
move and by tap I mean it Taps into the

3949
03:09:53,200 --> 03:09:54,640
area and pushes

3950
03:09:54,640 --> 03:09:57,319
out and then my band button is up and

3951
03:09:57,319 --> 03:09:59,880
running and then we tap into the area

3952
03:09:59,880 --> 03:10:02,120
and we push out but then we can come

3953
03:10:02,120 --> 03:10:05,359
back to the area second time and then

3954
03:10:05,359 --> 03:10:08,439
leave again so I don't know if this

3955
03:10:08,439 --> 03:10:11,520
imbalance was tapped I didn't check it

3956
03:10:11,520 --> 03:10:14,000
um so you see how we tap into this

3957
03:10:14,000 --> 03:10:15,359
imbalance and we

3958
03:10:15,359 --> 03:10:19,720
leave we don't hit the 50% of this area

3959
03:10:19,720 --> 03:10:22,439
at all I don't know if we end no we we

3960
03:10:22,439 --> 03:10:25,279
don't hit it at all so we still have an

3961
03:10:25,279 --> 03:10:28,399
imbalance within this area here that

3962
03:10:28,399 --> 03:10:31,680
price could potentially tap onto which

3963
03:10:31,680 --> 03:10:34,279
would also be a second entry because

3964
03:10:34,279 --> 03:10:35,840
this tapped into the imbalance but it

3965
03:10:35,840 --> 03:10:38,279
didn't hit the 50% so price can come

3966
03:10:38,279 --> 03:10:41,560
back down here and tap again into this

3967
03:10:41,560 --> 03:10:44,960
area and then end up taking you up so

3968
03:10:44,960 --> 03:10:46,840
all you really do

3969
03:10:46,840 --> 03:10:49,880
is you

3970
03:10:49,880 --> 03:10:53,680
take this area

3971
03:10:53,960 --> 03:10:59,200
here and uh this area

3972
03:10:59,439 --> 03:11:02,000
here and now you're expecting price to

3973
03:11:02,000 --> 03:11:04,080
potentially tap in here and give you

3974
03:11:04,080 --> 03:11:06,720
another move up where that move is going

3975
03:11:06,720 --> 03:11:08,840
it could potentially run the high or it

3976
03:11:08,840 --> 03:11:10,560
can just be coming back into another

3977
03:11:10,560 --> 03:11:12,920
imbalance above or another Zone above

3978
03:11:12,920 --> 03:11:16,399
that's unmitigated before trading

3979
03:11:16,399 --> 03:11:21,760
lower so this is what an imbalance

3980
03:11:21,760 --> 03:11:25,439
is it's price moved quickly out of the

3981
03:11:25,439 --> 03:11:28,640
area and it wasn't able to fill all of

3982
03:11:28,640 --> 03:11:32,040
the buy orders pushing up it wasn't able

3983
03:11:32,040 --> 03:11:35,479
to to fill it with the demand of or or

3984
03:11:35,479 --> 03:11:37,040
or the supply at least of the sell

3985
03:11:37,040 --> 03:11:38,319
orders coming

3986
03:11:38,319 --> 03:11:41,760
out so we got sell orders coming back to

3987
03:11:41,760 --> 03:11:43,319
fill

3988
03:11:43,319 --> 03:11:46,520
these this this imbalance but we didn't

3989
03:11:46,520 --> 03:11:49,560
get enough of it we want at least 50% or

3990
03:11:49,560 --> 03:11:52,520
even down into 90% before leaving

3991
03:11:52,520 --> 03:11:53,880
because if you don't have a seller then

3992
03:11:53,880 --> 03:11:55,880
you don't have a buyer you don't have a

3993
03:11:55,880 --> 03:11:57,720
buyer you don't have a seller so it's

3994
03:11:57,720 --> 03:11:59,640
supply and demand essentially that's all

3995
03:11:59,640 --> 03:12:01,800
the the market runs on is supply and

3996
03:12:01,800 --> 03:12:06,160
demand so if you look if you look up

3997
03:12:07,399 --> 03:12:11,000
here we talked

3998
03:12:11,040 --> 03:12:13,520
about which candle was it was it this

3999
03:12:13,520 --> 03:12:16,319
candle here or was it this

4000
03:12:16,319 --> 03:12:21,200
candle here oh no it was this one I'm

4001
03:12:23,239 --> 03:12:28,040
tripping so we talked about getting the

4002
03:12:28,040 --> 03:12:31,359
equal high but we want to see an equal

4003
03:12:31,359 --> 03:12:36,399
High happen on one side of the

4004
03:12:36,640 --> 03:12:39,720
high right

4005
03:12:39,720 --> 03:12:43,479
here we have the equal High

4006
03:12:43,479 --> 03:12:46,560
but we want to see an equal High here

4007
03:12:46,560 --> 03:12:49,720
created and then price shifted away and

4008
03:12:49,720 --> 03:12:53,279
tested that equal high and then that's

4009
03:12:53,279 --> 03:12:56,040
where the long is I mean the short sorry

4010
03:12:56,040 --> 03:12:58,200
but the longer move that's where the

4011
03:12:58,200 --> 03:13:01,600
longer move potentially heads to so if

4012
03:13:01,600 --> 03:13:04,000
you see

4013
03:13:04,000 --> 03:13:06,880
this if you see this as it happens I I

4014
03:13:06,880 --> 03:13:08,439
mentioned this when price tapped here I

4015
03:13:08,439 --> 03:13:09,720
said you want to see an equal high in

4016
03:13:09,720 --> 03:13:11,279
this area and then price shorted out of

4017
03:13:11,279 --> 03:13:13,960
the area um but I went to obviously

4018
03:13:13,960 --> 03:13:16,920
explaining something um so you you got

4019
03:13:16,920 --> 03:13:20,120
this you got to tap up into this area

4020
03:13:20,120 --> 03:13:21,479
you got a shift

4021
03:13:21,479 --> 03:13:25,200
away you got a tap back up into the area

4022
03:13:25,200 --> 03:13:27,800
again and then we made an equal high

4023
03:13:27,800 --> 03:13:31,000
around the entry so then we left we ran

4024
03:13:31,000 --> 03:13:33,399
the low of we ran the first low of the

4025
03:13:33,399 --> 03:13:36,760
equal high but then we tapped back into

4026
03:13:36,760 --> 03:13:39,319
the region of the equal high and then

4027
03:13:39,319 --> 03:13:41,560
now what we run the second

4028
03:13:41,560 --> 03:13:44,840
low and where do we

4029
03:13:44,840 --> 03:13:48,040
tap this imbalance

4030
03:13:48,040 --> 03:13:51,600
again but I want a further Mitigation Of

4031
03:13:51,600 --> 03:13:53,120
The imbalance at

4032
03:13:53,120 --> 03:13:55,040
least you're welcome brother you're

4033
03:13:55,040 --> 03:13:56,800
welcome

4034
03:13:56,800 --> 03:14:00,680
so um we have this low put

4035
03:14:00,680 --> 03:14:05,000
in we have the Run of this

4036
03:14:05,000 --> 03:14:08,319
High we come back into this area and

4037
03:14:08,319 --> 03:14:14,479
let's see if we make our way above it

4038
03:14:14,760 --> 03:14:16,720
did we cross a low no we didn't cross

4039
03:14:16,720 --> 03:14:20,279
the low of this snd

4040
03:14:25,600 --> 03:14:28,760
here so we tapped into this area we

4041
03:14:28,760 --> 03:14:30,680
would need a run of

4042
03:14:30,680 --> 03:14:34,279
this a run of this High here in order to

4043
03:14:34,279 --> 03:14:36,040
maybe tuck back into this area and

4044
03:14:36,040 --> 03:14:38,960
potentially long for

4045
03:14:40,200 --> 03:14:44,479
him let me see

4046
03:14:45,840 --> 03:14:47,239
yeah he's so

4047
03:14:47,239 --> 03:14:50,000
crazy all right let me

4048
03:14:50,000 --> 03:14:55,279
uh there you go yeah all right got you

4049
03:14:55,279 --> 03:14:57,720
um so yeah you know like it's it's the

4050
03:14:57,720 --> 03:15:01,160
same rules over and over um again same

4051
03:15:01,160 --> 03:15:03,200
thing over and over and over and over

4052
03:15:03,200 --> 03:15:04,600
and over and over and over

4053
03:15:04,600 --> 03:15:08,399
and again over and over and over again

4054
03:15:08,399 --> 03:15:10,000
and again if you learn this you will

4055
03:15:10,000 --> 03:15:13,520
never ever need anyone to trade again

4056
03:15:13,520 --> 03:15:15,239
ever you will

4057
03:15:15,239 --> 03:15:21,359
never ever need anyone in your life to

4058
03:15:21,359 --> 03:15:24,040
help you to trade again you will never

4059
03:15:24,040 --> 03:15:26,960
need to watch another trading video now

4060
03:15:26,960 --> 03:15:29,960
I still watch trading videos of other

4061
03:15:29,960 --> 03:15:32,640
people teaching like I was watching tra

4062
03:15:32,640 --> 03:15:34,479
track effects the other day because I

4063
03:15:34,479 --> 03:15:36,520
don't ever think that I've topped out in

4064
03:15:36,520 --> 03:15:39,040
knowing enough and there might be

4065
03:15:39,040 --> 03:15:41,120
something very slight within their

4066
03:15:41,120 --> 03:15:42,640
technique that I might be able to

4067
03:15:42,640 --> 03:15:47,800
utilize for myself you know but I just I

4068
03:15:47,800 --> 03:15:50,479
I still watch videos even though I know

4069
03:15:50,479 --> 03:15:53,359
that this like my style of trading is

4070
03:15:53,359 --> 03:15:55,880
all that in a bag of chips you bring any

4071
03:15:55,880 --> 03:15:59,439
other Trader to me and we rival at it we

4072
03:15:59,439 --> 03:16:01,720
can trade for charity we can be like hey

4073
03:16:01,720 --> 03:16:05,160
you know we start with x amount and

4074
03:16:05,160 --> 03:16:06,920
whatever we come up with we trade for

4075
03:16:06,920 --> 03:16:09,760
charity and I will blow them out of the

4076
03:16:09,760 --> 03:16:14,199
water because I know a fact how sure my

4077
03:16:14,199 --> 03:16:17,359
setup is but I'm also not saying that I

4078
03:16:17,359 --> 03:16:20,319
can't learn anything from them because I

4079
03:16:20,319 --> 03:16:22,640
can learn something else from their

4080
03:16:22,640 --> 03:16:25,120
particular trading style I don't doubt

4081
03:16:25,120 --> 03:16:29,319
that at all you know I I definitely

4082
03:16:29,319 --> 03:16:33,720
can so you I'm not pompous or anything

4083
03:16:33,720 --> 03:16:36,319
like that in that sense look this this

4084
03:16:36,319 --> 03:16:39,000
tap right here was the the test of this

4085
03:16:39,000 --> 03:16:40,399
area

4086
03:16:40,399 --> 03:16:42,880
here the test of this area

4087
03:16:42,880 --> 03:16:45,680
area that's the tap that you get hold on

4088
03:16:45,680 --> 03:16:48,120
real quick

4089
03:17:04,279 --> 03:17:08,880
guys sorry just checking on the kids um

4090
03:17:08,880 --> 03:17:11,199
I wonder is my latency

4091
03:17:11,199 --> 03:17:12,920
to

4092
03:17:12,920 --> 03:17:15,319
too

4093
03:17:15,479 --> 03:17:18,160
much let me see let me put my hand up

4094
03:17:18,160 --> 03:17:22,199
one two three four all right four five

4095
03:17:22,199 --> 03:17:23,600
seconds that's

4096
03:17:23,600 --> 03:17:27,920
fine um yeah so so we got to tap into

4097
03:17:27,920 --> 03:17:30,120
this area and we pushed up

4098
03:17:30,120 --> 03:17:32,359
above now look at

4099
03:17:32,359 --> 03:17:36,000
this this is the last high this is the

4100
03:17:36,000 --> 03:17:37,040
last

4101
03:17:37,040 --> 03:17:40,640
low here we tap into this area and what

4102
03:17:40,640 --> 03:17:43,560
we probably come up to this here if not

4103
03:17:43,560 --> 03:17:48,439
this then up here and if we make it past

4104
03:17:48,439 --> 03:17:49,800
this then we could potentially be

4105
03:17:49,800 --> 03:17:52,560
trading higher because the areas up here

4106
03:17:52,560 --> 03:17:53,640
are already

4107
03:17:53,640 --> 03:17:55,760
mitigated um are you in any trades at

4108
03:17:55,760 --> 03:17:57,760
the moment no I I usually just teach

4109
03:17:57,760 --> 03:18:02,520
most times um when when I'm doing this

4110
03:18:02,520 --> 03:18:05,399
because um teaching you guys definitely

4111
03:18:05,399 --> 03:18:07,720
need some undivided attention or else

4112
03:18:07,720 --> 03:18:09,800
the quality of the teaching won't be so

4113
03:18:09,800 --> 03:18:11,640
great if I was trading obviously I'm

4114
03:18:11,640 --> 03:18:13,120
paying attention into my money in the

4115
03:18:13,120 --> 03:18:15,319
market you know I want to make sure that

4116
03:18:15,319 --> 03:18:17,760
it's not doing anything that that is not

4117
03:18:17,760 --> 03:18:21,920
supposed to um but look you have yeah

4118
03:18:21,920 --> 03:18:25,439
you have this High Here We Dro in this

4119
03:18:25,439 --> 03:18:27,880
low so we would have to come above this

4120
03:18:27,880 --> 03:18:29,640
high if we were continuing higher

4121
03:18:29,640 --> 03:18:33,640
members section at least here um you

4122
03:18:33,640 --> 03:18:37,199
could actually just tap into hey armoney

4123
03:18:37,199 --> 03:18:39,319
you can actually just tap into uh this

4124
03:18:39,319 --> 03:18:42,600
area here um you know click on that and

4125
03:18:42,600 --> 03:18:44,560
then just oh damn it put my phone number

4126
03:18:44,560 --> 03:18:46,560
out there I don't care uh but yeah it

4127
03:18:46,560 --> 03:18:50,359
just Taps into to that area

4128
03:18:50,359 --> 03:18:54,120
there so um you can do that and and just

4129
03:18:54,120 --> 03:18:56,279
reach out to me personal message me I'm

4130
03:18:56,279 --> 03:18:58,920
fine with it no problem um and we can

4131
03:18:58,920 --> 03:19:01,040
chat from there but yeah that that's the

4132
03:19:01,040 --> 03:19:05,720
analysis that I have on um uh gold uh

4133
03:19:05,720 --> 03:19:07,199
and we'll just see if that if that

4134
03:19:07,199 --> 03:19:09,920
actually plays

4135
03:19:11,040 --> 03:19:12,800
out

4136
03:19:12,800 --> 03:19:15,160
look at

4137
03:19:15,960 --> 03:19:19,520
this so you see how we had this

4138
03:19:19,520 --> 03:19:24,439
tap came up tapped further into the area

4139
03:19:24,439 --> 03:19:25,720
went into the

4140
03:19:25,720 --> 03:19:31,080
low and then broke the high

4141
03:19:31,080 --> 03:19:34,080
here so we R trce down some let's see

4142
03:19:34,080 --> 03:19:36,000
what happens within this area do we get

4143
03:19:36,000 --> 03:19:38,960
a tap out of this

4144
03:19:41,040 --> 03:19:44,040
imbalance

4145
03:19:48,000 --> 03:19:50,120
do we get a tap within this imbalance to

4146
03:19:50,120 --> 03:19:53,720
take us back up and deliver us

4147
03:19:53,720 --> 03:19:57,279
to you know some of these areas above it

4148
03:19:57,279 --> 03:19:59,279
it could very well just be this area

4149
03:19:59,279 --> 03:20:03,080
here cuz this is a mitigated

4150
03:20:05,439 --> 03:20:09,080
here this is an unmitigated area here um

4151
03:20:09,080 --> 03:20:13,199
and we have one just directly above it

4152
03:20:13,199 --> 03:20:14,250
and then we

4153
03:20:14,250 --> 03:20:16,040
[Music]

4154
03:20:16,040 --> 03:20:19,680
have this

4155
03:20:21,880 --> 03:20:24,760
sorry yeah this was already

4156
03:20:24,760 --> 03:20:27,080
mitigated so we still have this area

4157
03:20:27,080 --> 03:20:29,439
above of T if price tries to make its

4158
03:20:29,439 --> 03:20:33,000
way back up um but if it crosses this

4159
03:20:33,000 --> 03:20:36,000
area

4160
03:20:36,040 --> 03:20:38,279
then there's a possibility that we're

4161
03:20:38,279 --> 03:20:40,920
running the

4162
03:20:40,920 --> 03:20:43,920
high

4163
03:20:45,920 --> 03:20:48,439
but you see how this is diverging now or

4164
03:20:48,439 --> 03:20:50,560
converging whatever they call

4165
03:20:50,560 --> 03:20:53,319
it this is making lower

4166
03:20:53,319 --> 03:20:58,000
highs um but this is also price is

4167
03:20:58,000 --> 03:21:00,560
bouncing up between these

4168
03:21:00,560 --> 03:21:04,279
areas you know high low and it's coming

4169
03:21:04,279 --> 03:21:07,239
closer and closer together with the

4170
03:21:07,239 --> 03:21:10,279
highs and lows that it's making so they

4171
03:21:10,279 --> 03:21:12,960
usually um with retail Traders they'll

4172
03:21:12,960 --> 03:21:14,760
have a high here and they'll be like

4173
03:21:14,760 --> 03:21:17,080
okay sell here and it's going to go

4174
03:21:17,080 --> 03:21:20,680
out and then there are other people who

4175
03:21:20,680 --> 03:21:23,239
view the market and they're like okay if

4176
03:21:23,239 --> 03:21:26,960
this TAPS in first and retests this

4177
03:21:26,960 --> 03:21:30,640
area you buy

4178
03:21:30,800 --> 03:21:33,840
here and then you potentially sell out

4179
03:21:33,840 --> 03:21:36,239
so both people are viewing the markets

4180
03:21:36,239 --> 03:21:39,840
in different ways taking different

4181
03:21:39,840 --> 03:21:44,080
trades this guy is going going to

4182
03:21:44,080 --> 03:21:46,239
here for a quick

4183
03:21:46,239 --> 03:21:49,600
scalp this guy is going to here for a

4184
03:21:49,600 --> 03:21:53,239
quick Scout so we have a lot of activity

4185
03:21:53,239 --> 03:21:55,800
happening within here then you have the

4186
03:21:55,800 --> 03:21:58,840
conservative traders who want to see it

4187
03:21:58,840 --> 03:22:01,239
come out of the

4188
03:22:01,239 --> 03:22:04,479
area tap back into the area and

4189
03:22:04,479 --> 03:22:06,800
leave and then you have the other people

4190
03:22:06,800 --> 03:22:09,199
who want to see it drop out of the area

4191
03:22:09,199 --> 03:22:12,560
tap back into the area and go

4192
03:22:12,560 --> 03:22:14,920
so there's a lot of anticipation

4193
03:22:14,920 --> 03:22:17,680
followed by a lot of volume that could

4194
03:22:17,680 --> 03:22:20,520
potentially happen within this area

4195
03:22:20,520 --> 03:22:22,399
because all of these different things

4196
03:22:22,399 --> 03:22:25,800
that are here buy Stops Here Sell stops

4197
03:22:25,800 --> 03:22:27,399
here buy limits Here Sell limits here

4198
03:22:27,399 --> 03:22:29,600
stop loss behind here to sell down into

4199
03:22:29,600 --> 03:22:31,479
here stop loss behind here to buy up

4200
03:22:31,479 --> 03:22:33,760
into here there's a lot of stuff

4201
03:22:33,760 --> 03:22:36,279
happening within this area

4202
03:22:36,279 --> 03:22:40,760
here because you see price

4203
03:22:40,760 --> 03:22:43,760
converging

4204
03:22:43,920 --> 03:22:46,199
and one

4205
03:22:46,199 --> 03:22:49,239
of these Traders are

4206
03:22:49,239 --> 03:22:51,880
right some are impulsive and are going

4207
03:22:51,880 --> 03:22:53,000
to be

4208
03:22:53,000 --> 03:22:55,000
wrong some

4209
03:22:55,000 --> 03:22:57,560
are right and are going to walk away

4210
03:22:57,560 --> 03:23:00,160
with some profit today some are going to

4211
03:23:00,160 --> 03:23:02,680
blow their

4212
03:23:03,160 --> 03:23:05,720
accounts but nonetheless this is all of

4213
03:23:05,720 --> 03:23:08,680
the engagement in the market this is how

4214
03:23:08,680 --> 03:23:10,000
everybody's

4215
03:23:10,000 --> 03:23:15,520
playing to there two there two there two

4216
03:23:15,520 --> 03:23:17,920
there and they're playing with these

4217
03:23:17,920 --> 03:23:20,840
patterns and for other

4218
03:23:20,840 --> 03:23:25,239
Traders they are

4219
03:23:25,239 --> 03:23:28,720
essentially waiting for structure to

4220
03:23:28,720 --> 03:23:31,520
show us what it's going to do because as

4221
03:23:31,520 --> 03:23:33,120
far as structure is concerned it's

4222
03:23:33,120 --> 03:23:34,399
making higher

4223
03:23:34,399 --> 03:23:36,560
highs I mean sorry it's making higher

4224
03:23:36,560 --> 03:23:40,680
lows but it's also making lower highs as

4225
03:23:40,680 --> 03:23:42,520
well

4226
03:23:42,520 --> 03:23:46,359
so both people are viewing the market

4227
03:23:46,359 --> 03:23:48,160
and not really understanding what's

4228
03:23:48,160 --> 03:23:50,600
actually

4229
03:23:50,960 --> 03:23:53,880
happening and this is

4230
03:23:53,880 --> 03:23:59,359
where we're trying to make some sense of

4231
03:23:59,359 --> 03:24:01,800
it we'd end up being in the middle of

4232
03:24:01,800 --> 03:24:02,960
the

4233
03:24:02,960 --> 03:24:06,920
market so we fell out of this SN after

4234
03:24:06,920 --> 03:24:09,800
we failed to make a new high we crashed

4235
03:24:09,800 --> 03:24:13,319
through the snd so this snd no longer

4236
03:24:13,319 --> 03:24:15,720
matters this doesn't matter you still

4237
03:24:15,720 --> 03:24:19,000
have this snd above and you still

4238
03:24:19,000 --> 03:24:22,359
have this imbalance here below with this

4239
03:24:22,359 --> 03:24:24,880
snd down here so you want to look at

4240
03:24:24,880 --> 03:24:27,319
what price potentially does within this

4241
03:24:27,319 --> 03:24:31,439
area in order to potentially run this

4242
03:24:31,439 --> 03:24:33,279
there's liquidity here this is trend

4243
03:24:33,279 --> 03:24:34,040
line

4244
03:24:34,040 --> 03:24:38,560
liquidity here some here some extending

4245
03:24:38,560 --> 03:24:42,279
even up here going into down here

4246
03:24:42,279 --> 03:24:44,000
so this is but this is why you want to

4247
03:24:44,000 --> 03:24:45,479
pay attention to when these are

4248
03:24:45,479 --> 03:24:48,479
happening here I gave you guys the rules

4249
03:24:48,479 --> 03:24:53,040
to this what did I say I said that if we

4250
03:24:53,040 --> 03:24:55,560
run this High we can go bullish but if

4251
03:24:55,560 --> 03:24:58,960
we run this High

4252
03:25:00,279 --> 03:25:04,239
here if we run this High since we put in

4253
03:25:04,239 --> 03:25:06,760
this low and ran this High we're looking

4254
03:25:06,760 --> 03:25:09,199
for the retracement back into the area

4255
03:25:09,199 --> 03:25:10,479
and then we

4256
03:25:10,479 --> 03:25:13,479
go

4257
03:25:14,880 --> 03:25:16,960
and look we just double tapped within

4258
03:25:16,960 --> 03:25:20,640
this this region up here and got

4259
03:25:20,640 --> 03:25:23,120
rejected

4260
03:25:23,479 --> 03:25:29,359
out so these these have rules to them as

4261
03:25:29,359 --> 03:25:31,560
well you know you're you're not just

4262
03:25:31,560 --> 03:25:33,279
taking it because you see this pattern

4263
03:25:33,279 --> 03:25:35,560
on the bottom side you're looking to see

4264
03:25:35,560 --> 03:25:37,720
if there was any shifting in price that

4265
03:25:37,720 --> 03:25:42,800
happened in this entire area here

4266
03:25:42,800 --> 03:25:45,880
what happened we put in a low we ran the

4267
03:25:45,880 --> 03:25:48,520
last High we retraced back into the area

4268
03:25:48,520 --> 03:25:50,920
and then we

4269
03:25:51,760 --> 03:25:54,560
left it's the same thing over and over

4270
03:25:54,560 --> 03:25:57,760
and over again so it's in those videos

4271
03:25:57,760 --> 03:26:00,800
um the you if you guys take time to just

4272
03:26:00,800 --> 03:26:02,319
