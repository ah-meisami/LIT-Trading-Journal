1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,560
all right um

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:05,759
and guys before we start i do want to um

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,080
take a minute to tell you guys that

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,080
um i'm not a financial advisor i do not

5
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:11,920
have credentials to be a financial

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,799
advisor i do not even take

7
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:16,560
my financial advice and i'm not

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,199
expecting you guys to take my financial

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,760
advice because it is illegal to give

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,439
financial advice

11
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,160
when you're not a certified or licensed

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,480
financial advisor so

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,160
if you and if you are in need of

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,000
financial advice

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,960
contact your local financial advisor

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,200
and they'll be sure

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:37,920
to

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,719
help you navigate the world of trading i

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:42,480
can't promise you that they won't be

20
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,120
working for the billionaire class or any

21
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,399
special interest but i will say that

22
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:50,640
they certainly will guide you in in some

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:52,800
direction within the financial markets

24
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,719
and because that's the way our laws are

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,160
where you can only receive financial

26
00:00:56,160 --> 00:00:58,559
advice from them it's best for you to

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,480
follow the law and

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:03,920
you know go to them so um

29
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:07,520
now that we have our bias

30
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,119
this is our one hour bias

31
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:12,960
because you you can get the bias from

32
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,439
different time frames not just

33
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:16,960
you know um

34
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:19,439
a specific time frame you can get your s

35
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
and d's from from the time frame you're

36
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,080
trading on but you could also get a bias

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,280
from where

38
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:28,640
you have an idea of of price going

39
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
um

40
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:32,640
you know on on other time frames so to

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:34,240
help reinforce whether you're looking

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:35,600
for buys for the day or whether you're

43
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,799
looking for sales for the day

44
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,479
all right so

45
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:45,439
we have this area here let me explain

46
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,240
this this trade real quick for you guys

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:50,000
um because you you might see it happen

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,079
to the top side here but let me just

49
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,560
explain how i saw this i mean this is

50
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:57,119
obviously you know where the market

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,000
opened up but what i realized

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:02,960
with this particular area let me move

53
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,040
this just in case you guys

54
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:06,640
may not be able to see it what i

55
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,639
realized with this particular area is

56
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:11,280
you see price shifts down

57
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,400
price ends up taking out the low

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:16,879
that's here

59
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,680
it took out this low with this body

60
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
closure below the low

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:26,640
then price flips to the top side

62
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,040
and what did i mention when you have a

63
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:31,840
flip to the top side after

64
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
a break of structure to the downside

65
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,080
that you have to look for an area of an

66
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,920
important low

67
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,400
that price may trade above

68
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,640
before retracing

69
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:45,840
so

70
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,280
when i saw this push back up

71
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,400
i saw this candle take out this high

72
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:53,599
right here

73
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,319
now why am i using this high

74
00:02:56,319 --> 00:02:58,239
i'm using this high

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:00,640
because

76
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,400
this is intermediary structure

77
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,360
so this is a low

78
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,680
sorry this is a high this is a low

79
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,519
this is a high

80
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:13,680
this didn't give us a low here you see

81
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:15,360
this little wick here because it didn't

82
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,800
go below this

83
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
but this did

84
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:19,840
so

85
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:21,680
what do we now have

86
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:24,000
price possibly returning

87
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:25,920
to the upside

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,040
so

89
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,799
we break this low with this

90
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:33,040
wick here

91
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:34,640
i'm sorry this high we break this high

92
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,000
with this wig here i haven't had my

93
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,000
coffee as of yet i'm so sorry just a

94
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:38,799
little

95
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,760
uh disoriented and and i'm gonna get it

96
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,000
together uh my coffee's being warmed up

97
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,799
now

98
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:46,560
but um

99
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,200
by me of course so i'm gonna have to cut

100
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,000
from this and go get it but um

101
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:53,519
you know you have this high that was

102
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:55,360
taken out

103
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:57,680
and then price traded back within the

104
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:58,720
area

105
00:03:58,720 --> 00:03:59,599
so

106
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,239
what i usually you know mention on this

107
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,720
channel is when you have a high a

108
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:06,879
previous high that was taken out

109
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:09,840
and then price trades away from it

110
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,879
usually you're getting a pullback into

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:16,160
the area that price just came from

112
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:18,560
or price just created you're getting a

113
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,839
pullback into that area and then you're

114
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,960
taking price long so i had

115
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:28,520
this particular

116
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,680
price price wasn't here yet but i put

117
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,720
this line here and i you know put this

118
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,800
arrow heading out of the area

119
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,759
and

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:40,560
you know what what you might see

121
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:41,680
is

122
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:43,600
price looked like it was going to return

123
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:46,000
to that area

124
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,680
after the pullback but what did i

125
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,680
mention i mentioned

126
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,040
that you have pullbacks when highs are

127
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,560
ran

128
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:56,240
you know you're not playing the high

129
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,919
with a a you know sell limit order here

130
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,560
to come down you're not doing that but

131
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,600
you're just observing okay this high was

132
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:07,039
now taken out

133
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:09,440
so price could potentially shift back

134
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,960
into this area

135
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:12,960
we did get a shift into this area but

136
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:15,360
price quickly moved away so what do we

137
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,880
have we end up having an entire area

138
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:19,840
that

139
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:22,240
is unmitigated

140
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:23,600
here

141
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:25,039
unmitigate it

142
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:27,440
price didn't return to this area to

143
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,680
mitigate this area before leaving

144
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
so

145
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,800
you have a small imbalance here you have

146
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,440
price and an unmitigated area so this is

147
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,080
an area that you could potentially trade

148
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,039
from

149
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,280
when price comes back to it whether it's

150
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:47,039
a reaction from the area whether it's

151
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:47,850
you know um

152
00:05:47,850 --> 00:05:48,960
[Music]

153
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:50,880
you know just it

154
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,080
it runs from the area all the way to

155
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,280
take out a high now once you get in on

156
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,520
this you're gonna look when price comes

157
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,240
into this area you're gonna look for a

158
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:04,639
bullish flip this same type of flip that

159
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,759
we just observed where price went up

160
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:10,240
took out a previous high traded back

161
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,120
into the area and then left this same

162
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,759
type of thing here should happen if

163
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:17,840
price chooses to come down into this

164
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,639
area mitigate it and then leave you're

165
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:24,319
gonna have this happen before price

166
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:26,479
leaves to take out the new high

167
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:28,720
or the new low so this is why you pay

168
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,479
attention to

169
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:33,120
these areas where price flips and just

170
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:35,120
as i mentioned

171
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,919
i said that you could possibly have it

172
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:40,720
on the top side which that's exactly

173
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,000
what we have

174
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,199
we have price trading higher

175
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,520
this is an important low

176
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:49,919
this is making some some highs and lows

177
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,440
in here but there's no body closure

178
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:54,720
above

179
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,440
to solidify this low yet so price can

180
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,680
continue to come down into this area

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,520
until here

182
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,360
this candle closes above the high

183
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,960
of the low that was established

184
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,840
so

185
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,400
because this candle closed above we have

186
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,840
a stronger indication

187
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:17,840
that you know price is going to continue

188
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,039
higher

189
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:20,720
it closed above

190
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,599
it did not make a lower low after it

191
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:26,000
established this low it did not make a

192
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,479
lower low it actually made a higher low

193
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:29,520
so then

194
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:31,120
we have price

195
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,479
come up into this area

196
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,639
right here we have price come up into

197
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:38,639
this area and what does it do create

198
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,280
another high for us so what's what's

199
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,960
established here

200
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:44,400
the new low

201
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,120
is established here when a new high is

202
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:49,840
created a new low is validated i should

203
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:51,039
say that

204
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:53,840
when a new high is created

205
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:54,800
so

206
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,560
we had this new low put in and we had a

207
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,879
new high created and then what happened

208
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:05,199
the low was ran

209
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:07,280
so what are we looking for

210
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:09,280
when the low is ran

211
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,599
we're looking for price to retrace back

212
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,240
up into this area

213
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:17,440
and we're taking it short

214
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,599
so a lot of people

215
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:21,919
really don't understand you know like

216
00:08:21,919 --> 00:08:25,759
they have issues on on where to get in

217
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,479
from with trading from certain areas

218
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:29,599
and

219
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:31,440
it's just because they're not really

220
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,320
noticing the price action

221
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:35,519
going on

222
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:36,719
in this

223
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:37,839
so

224
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,320
when you have an idea of the price

225
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,399
action what's happening

226
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:45,040
right now in this moment with price and

227
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:46,560
you're monitoring it this is the one

228
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,320
minute so you have to pay attention to

229
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:50,640
this because it all happens fast

230
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,519
but

231
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:52,800
you have

232
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:55,040
the hourly now you could examine the

233
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,640
hourly and set up a

234
00:08:56,640 --> 00:08:58,399
an hourly move

235
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,399
just based on this alone

236
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:02,240
we went to the hourly and saw this s d

237
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,920
here we saw the hourly take out a high

238
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:04,959
to the left

239
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,680
we said when price trades above a high

240
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:09,760
usually have a pullback after

241
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,040
this is on the one minute that we're

242
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:13,279
watching this pullback but

243
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,240
we got the high taken out on a higher

244
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,920
time frame

245
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:19,440
so because it was taken out in a higher

246
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:22,080
time frame we should end up having a

247
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:23,040
trend

248
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,000
back into this area before price pushes

249
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,720
up

250
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:29,440
again if price is going to push up again

251
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,440
how do we know price is pushing up again

252
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:34,720
we know it when we notice this same

253
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,200
requirement this same setup

254
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,440
on the downside

255
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:41,760
and when we notice that on the downside

256
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:44,560
it gives us time to set set us up for a

257
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,600
buy

258
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:49,040
as well as set us up to get out of this

259
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:51,279
trade because now the retracement is

260
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:54,880
finished and we possibly trending to the

261
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,000
top side

262
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
and we don't get out of the buy

263
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,720
from what you know when we catch it

264
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:02,959
below we don't get out of it

265
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:04,480
until

266
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:08,800
we see bearish behavior created up here

267
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:10,880
and then it lets us know

268
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,320
let's get out

269
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,680
so

270
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,480
you know in that explanation

271
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:18,560
you have this

272
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,760
as the area of entry you have this

273
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:23,120
as

274
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:24,640
the stop loss

275
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:25,839
the high

276
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,079
as a stop loss in which you're looking

277
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:30,480
to take the short from and where are you

278
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,560
shorting to the next possible area

279
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,440
which

280
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:37,839
there's this possible area after price

281
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:38,880
left it

282
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,040
there was no mitigation to it

283
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,760
this entire area here

284
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,320
price pushed to the top side so what

285
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:48,160
could you potentially have

286
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,240
you could potentially have a movement in

287
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,680
price that

288
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:54,160
comes here

289
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:56,399
you know or

290
00:10:56,399 --> 00:10:59,279
you might have it

291
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,320
i don't know come here

292
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,399
so let me take this

293
00:11:09,519 --> 00:11:13,079
put that there

294
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
and

295
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:26,959
you put that there and you just you just

296
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:29,839
see which one is the more likely area

297
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,680
for price to tap into and go

298
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:35,120
a lot of the times it's an area where

299
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:37,360
there's an imbalance that's near do we

300
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,959
have the imbalance yeah we do right here

301
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:42,959
it's an area that price hasn't come back

302
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:44,959
into do we have the area that price

303
00:11:44,959 --> 00:11:49,120
didn't come back into yeah right here

304
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:51,519
you know and and a lot of people call

305
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,399
this choppy but if you really do pay

306
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:57,040
attention to what's happening here you

307
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,040
have one low

308
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,640
put in

309
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:03,519
and then you have a series of lows being

310
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,640
created and ran

311
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
so when price is manipulating the lows

312
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,560
it's showing you that it still wants to

313
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:15,279
go to the top side

314
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:16,639
and you get that where is the

315
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:18,880
established low here

316
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:20,720
because price never came back to this

317
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:22,880
low so guess where they started buying

318
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:24,880
here

319
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:28,079
and after they buy

320
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:30,800
all the way up

321
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:34,079
they begin to when they get to a

322
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:35,760
particular you know area that they're

323
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,680
ready to get out they begin to dump

324
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:41,680
selling their profits

325
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:43,360
sorry

326
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:46,240
selling their profits

327
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,360
after this push-up because remember we

328
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:52,000
can't move the market retail we we can't

329
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,079
like you know us trading on these little

330
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:56,320
accounts even if we had you know 100

331
00:12:56,320 --> 00:12:58,240
million dollars to trade with we're not

332
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:01,279
moving this market at all

333
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,200
this is a market that the bank's moving

334
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,720
so the best way to trade this market

335
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:08,320
is to trade

336
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,320
with the banks

337
00:13:10,320 --> 00:13:12,560
use these little footprints that they

338
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:15,519
leave behind these are these are little

339
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:17,040
small

340
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:19,600
things that that little small footprints

341
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:22,000
that they leave back here

342
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,079
for us to be able to learn to trade from

343
00:13:26,079 --> 00:13:27,279
and

344
00:13:27,279 --> 00:13:29,839
as we're using these you know like you

345
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:31,600
you can't do something and

346
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,839
and not leave any evidence behind

347
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:36,160
there's always something left it's like

348
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:36,880
a

349
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,880
a kid stealing

350
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:40,880
cookies out of the cookie jar

351
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,279
what do you usually see

352
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,200
crumbs of cookies all over their face

353
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,160
hands dirty or jar left open or one

354
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
cookie missing but either way within

355
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,760
that scenario

356
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,200
you always can figure out

357
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:57,920
where the evidence was left

358
00:13:57,920 --> 00:14:00,800
where did they slip up

359
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:01,680
and

360
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,720
you go back and and you you analyze that

361
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,279
and that's what i've seen

362
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
trading in these markets

363
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:12,639
in in all of these markets that's what

364
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:13,680
i've seen

365
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:15,440
the little footprints that they leave

366
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:17,519
behind so i know other people like to

367
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:19,199
use white golf other people like to use

368
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,000
ema's divergence with the rsi all these

369
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,279
different things these different

370
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:26,000
patterns stuff like that you know i've i

371
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,680
got rid of all of that i started that

372
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:29,360
way and yeah some people can be

373
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:31,839
profitable with that you know but

374
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,560
an easier way for me an easier

375
00:14:34,560 --> 00:14:36,320
understanding for me

376
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:37,519
is

377
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:38,720
using

378
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:41,040
these little footprints that are left in

379
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
the market now timing these

380
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,399
is is incredibly you know

381
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,160
scary and and anxious sometimes because

382
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:52,160
what you have is

383
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,000
you often have

384
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,600
you know where sometimes you can get a

385
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,519
fake out here

386
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,079
because look you have

387
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:02,800
you have this low right here

388
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,880
you have a high

389
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,680
here on this candle

390
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:10,240
so if you look

391
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,480
this candle here came

392
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,440
just above the high like a little let me

393
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:17,360
let me actually zoom in so you guys can

394
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,519
see it so you think i'm lying and making

395
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:21,680
up stuff

396
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:23,120
right

397
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,160
here

398
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,839
this was our low

399
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,240
and

400
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:33,360
this actually so no look at that

401
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,160
this is our low

402
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:38,880
this is our high

403
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:41,839
why because it's low in too high and

404
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:43,519
then low is created

405
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:44,320
so

406
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,240
this is our low

407
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:49,040
this is our low this is our high

408
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:51,120
we come down here

409
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:52,800
we shift

410
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,040
price downward and we create a lower low

411
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:00,880
why does price still go up

412
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:03,120
you might be wondering yeah why does

413
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,720
price still go up

414
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:06,720
after we took out the low

415
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:09,519
the reason why is because we didn't put

416
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,320
in another high yet

417
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,800
look look at this this is

418
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:17,199
this is the last low

419
00:16:17,199 --> 00:16:19,199
this is the last high

420
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:21,360
did we get a candle closure

421
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:22,399
above

422
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,680
sorry did we get a candle closure above

423
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,240
this high right here

424
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:30,480
no we didn't

425
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:32,800
no candle closure above the high before

426
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:34,639
the low was ran

427
00:16:34,639 --> 00:16:36,160
so because we didn't get a candle

428
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,079
closure above the high and then the low

429
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:39,440
was taken out

430
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,160
we're not taking this trade

431
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,079
we're not taking the pullback of this

432
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:48,399
trade into the continuation down

433
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:50,880
because we first need

434
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:53,279
a high established

435
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:55,360
and then

436
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,759
a low taken out

437
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:00,079
and after the high is established a new

438
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:01,759
high that's supposed to come from over

439
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:03,519
here it did not come

440
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:04,880
after

441
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:06,959
the high is established

442
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,679
like it it broke structure to the upside

443
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:12,079
body structure to the upside you don't

444
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:15,919
have that you just have a candle

445
00:17:15,919 --> 00:17:19,439
that closed here we put in a low here

446
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:21,439
and then we came here

447
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:23,119
we don't have a candle closure above

448
00:17:23,119 --> 00:17:24,000
here

449
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,720
above this high

450
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:27,839
so

451
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,360
technically

452
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:30,160
when

453
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:32,720
it drives below the low we're not

454
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,720
looking to take the pull back into this

455
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:36,320
area not saying that it can't pull back

456
00:17:36,320 --> 00:17:39,600
into this area and go because it can

457
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:43,200
but the likelihood is is much smaller

458
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,559
when

459
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:47,919
there hasn't been a new high established

460
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:50,880
before running the low

461
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,559
and that's why i said that when we were

462
00:17:52,559 --> 00:17:55,039
here i would like to get a close above

463
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:57,360
this area or a couple candles within

464
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:58,240
this

465
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,200
area so if i get a close above this area

466
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,120
and then the lowest ran

467
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:04,320
then

468
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,240
cool i could look for a pullback and

469
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,640
then take take the trade down

470
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:11,120
but if i don't get a close above

471
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,679
then we're still going high

472
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,440
and we kept going high until here

473
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
and what did we get we got the low we

474
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:21,679
got the candle closure above

475
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:24,080
the high

476
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,160
candle closure above

477
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:29,120
and then we trade it back below it right

478
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:31,200
here

479
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:33,760
where do we trade back below it on this

480
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:36,080
candle

481
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:37,919
actually i'm sorry this was our this was

482
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:40,080
our our low i'm sorry forgive me this

483
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,520
was a high

484
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:42,960
this was our low

485
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:45,120
this was the new high this was the run

486
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:47,840
of the low price pulled back

487
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:52,160
and then we take out from this area

488
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,840
and now we look

489
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:57,679
for some bullish behavior to this

490
00:18:57,679 --> 00:19:00,320
downside

491
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:03,120
and that's how

492
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:05,600
you like if you were in this trade

493
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,280
and you were expecting it to go down

494
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:09,840
here and then you had price shift up

495
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,960
right here

496
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:12,960
and come back to this area

497
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,200
you know a lot of the times you might be

498
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:17,280
trying to figure out well is price gonna

499
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,160
push

500
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,400
all the way back up to this area and

501
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:22,080
take me out

502
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,400
there's a possibility that's why we

503
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:27,600
partial out at certain areas

504
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:29,039
of price

505
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:31,360
we'll partial out at certain structural

506
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:32,559
areas

507
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,919
low here

508
00:19:33,919 --> 00:19:35,360
low here

509
00:19:35,360 --> 00:19:38,000
some people might partial out here you

510
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,960
know or some people will wait to partial

511
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,039
out down here hoping that price gets

512
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,039
there and if it doesn't they get taken

513
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:48,240
out of break even cool risk-free trade

514
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:50,320
you know you didn't technically lose i

515
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:53,520
mean except for the commission

516
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,799
you know but

517
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:56,880
you got to make sure that you you take

518
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:59,520
some profit off of the table

519
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:01,440
runners will get whatever other profit

520
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,039
that that you know you you didn't get

521
00:20:05,039 --> 00:20:08,320
but there's multiple setups that happen

522
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:11,440
and when you have these multiple setups

523
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,280
happening

524
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:15,760
you can partial out at all these

525
00:20:15,760 --> 00:20:17,039
different all these different trades

526
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,280
that you you're going to take

527
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:21,280
you can partial out on it

528
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:24,160
so this was before the market open this

529
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:27,039
trade down here was after

530
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:27,840
um

531
00:20:27,840 --> 00:20:30,159
the market opened

532
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:32,240
and then you have another setup that's

533
00:20:32,240 --> 00:20:34,480
there

534
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:35,760
so

535
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:37,919
when you have all of these different

536
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:39,120
setups

537
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:40,720
this is actually where i thought it was

538
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:42,240
going to reject from but price still

539
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:44,799
pushed higher

540
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,840
you you tend to get these setups

541
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,760
to where

542
00:20:51,760 --> 00:20:53,840
you know you're

543
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,640
you're catching major moves 161 pips

544
00:20:57,640 --> 00:21:02,320
117 pips 126 pips and you can partial

545
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:04,000
out at half of those partial out at

546
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,720
different areas

547
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,200
now with with this particularly coming

548
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,880
down i did not partial out out of this

549
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,360
because i actually saw

550
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:18,640
this low get ran

551
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:21,919
and because this low here was ran

552
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:24,159
i realized it'd be another pull back up

553
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,799
and then when price gets to the area

554
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:29,039
that you can actually trade from you get

555
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:32,080
a strong rejection out of that area

556
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:35,039
then you get a return into the area and

557
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:36,000
then

558
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,320
a push out so most people are probably

559
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,880
wondering why didn't you take this trade

560
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,640
here

561
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,559
right here

562
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:48,400
stops behind here behind the area

563
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:51,919
why didn't you take this trade up

564
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:54,080
somebody could have very well taken this

565
00:21:54,080 --> 00:21:55,440
trade

566
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:59,679
right into this area tap and it goes

567
00:21:59,679 --> 00:22:01,200
a lot of the times

568
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,159
you get another pull back into the area

569
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:06,080
and that's where some traders see the

570
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:08,240
double bottom

571
00:22:08,240 --> 00:22:10,880
and then they jump in to go

572
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:14,240
and you do oftentimes get a pullback you

573
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:15,919
know sometimes when prices strongly

574
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:18,400
reacting from that area you do get a

575
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,280
second pullback into that area before

576
00:22:21,280 --> 00:22:22,799
price continues

577
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:24,960
and that's exactly what happened on this

578
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:26,480
side

579
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:27,200
so

580
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,080
if

581
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,000
if i was told

582
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,080
to well well if i

583
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:33,360
created a bias and was like you know

584
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,480
what let me just trade from this

585
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,080
particular area

586
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:37,600
i could have

587
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:38,320
but

588
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:40,240
if price didn't go where i was expecting

589
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,240
it to go which was right here

590
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,919
then it would have came back and stopped

591
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:46,159
me out

592
00:22:46,159 --> 00:22:48,159
stopped me out right there and then went

593
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:49,679
in the direction that i thought it was

594
00:22:49,679 --> 00:22:52,080
going in

595
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:54,880
and this is why you want to wait for the

596
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,200
confirmation of

597
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,799
bullish behavior what is the

598
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,280
confirmation of bullish behavior look

599
00:23:01,280 --> 00:23:03,120
price came down

600
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,799
price flipped

601
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:07,520
above the last high

602
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:10,640
ended up taking us down here below this

603
00:23:10,640 --> 00:23:14,640
low but then you had another push up

604
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:16,640
how did we get involved in this because

605
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:19,120
we spotted right here

606
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:20,720
that this high

607
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,960
was being taken out

608
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:25,360
so we had a pullback and it took us

609
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:27,679
right up to our area now could we have

610
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,679
taken this long yeah

611
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,400
further yeah we could have

612
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:34,000
but that wasn't that that wasn't the

613
00:23:34,000 --> 00:23:36,640
area that i was targeting you know so

614
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,120
it's all about a matter of of managing

615
00:23:39,120 --> 00:23:41,760
it because

616
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:43,200
right here

617
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,679
you know i got out but yes i could have

618
00:23:45,679 --> 00:23:47,919
still stayed in and waited until i saw

619
00:23:47,919 --> 00:23:50,080
some bearish behavior take place within

620
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:51,600
this area

621
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:54,640
and if price came out of this area

622
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,960
and i'm still in this trade i know that

623
00:23:56,960 --> 00:23:59,360
you might have a pullback back into this

624
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:02,159
area here and this is where i'll get out

625
00:24:02,159 --> 00:24:05,280
and get in a cell and then take it down

626
00:24:05,280 --> 00:24:07,440
but i need to see

627
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:10,240
the bearish behavior take place in this

628
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,960
area to know that i'm selling from it

629
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,120
just like it did up here

630
00:24:15,120 --> 00:24:18,320
i need that to happen

631
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:20,880
and and what you have

632
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,360
you you had that here remember i said

633
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,440
there's some bullish behavior that you

634
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:27,679
want to pay attention to

635
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,679
what do we have you know within this

636
00:24:29,679 --> 00:24:34,480
intermediary structure here we have

637
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
right within here

638
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:40,559
low high low high

639
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:41,679
low

640
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:44,159
run of the high

641
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:46,720
not just this high but this high

642
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,480
ran it

643
00:24:48,480 --> 00:24:51,679
pushed up wrapped back around into the

644
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:53,679
area

645
00:24:53,679 --> 00:24:55,520
and then

646
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,559
took us

647
00:24:56,559 --> 00:25:00,279
for a long backup

648
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:01,440
so

649
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:03,200
this is something that you want to pay

650
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,600
attention to because it helps you to

651
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:08,240
manage the trades that you're in

652
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,880
it really really helps you to to stay in

653
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:12,640
these trades like there's some people

654
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,960
that will cut their trade here

655
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:17,520
and then if price ends up melting

656
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:19,360
further down to this side it's like oh

657
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:21,279
man i should have stayed in and what do

658
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,320
they do

659
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:24,480
they turn around and they try to jump in

660
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:26,880
on another trade here

661
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:28,480
and when they jump in on another trade

662
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,840
here

663
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:31,679
when this low is ran what are we

664
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:34,720
expecting to happen

665
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:36,559
we're expecting to pull back into this

666
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:38,000
area so

667
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,880
they go chasing

668
00:25:40,880 --> 00:25:42,559
down

669
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,720
down here when this low is ran they go

670
00:25:44,720 --> 00:25:47,039
chasing it hoping that it's gonna go

671
00:25:47,039 --> 00:25:50,000
further oh man bearish momentum coming

672
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,080
out of the area yeah gotta get in on

673
00:25:52,080 --> 00:25:52,960
that

674
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:54,320
and then

675
00:25:54,320 --> 00:25:55,279
price

676
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:58,080
triggers them in runs the low and then

677
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,080
take us back for a pullback

678
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:02,640
and now your stop loss is right

679
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,559
because more than likely you would have

680
00:26:04,559 --> 00:26:07,440
put the trade here put it behind

681
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,679
a previous structural area or even

682
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:11,760
possibly put it behind here but who

683
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,480
wants a stop loss like that

684
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,440
who wants a huge stop loss

685
00:26:17,440 --> 00:26:19,919
hoping that price doesn't come into the

686
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:21,440
area

687
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:24,080
but then you don't know where price is

688
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:24,960
going

689
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,840
that's a whole bunch of uncertainty

690
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,720
in this one trade if you were running

691
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,440
and chasing it

692
00:26:36,840 --> 00:26:39,840
so we had this bullish flip to the

693
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,080
downside

694
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:44,480
and now we're looking for

695
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:45,600
possibly

696
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:47,440
a bearish flip

697
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,640
and we may not get that

698
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,880
you know we we might have price

699
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,279
pull back up into this area and and just

700
00:26:55,279 --> 00:26:57,600
continue to go above because our

701
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:01,039
original bias is that it's coming here

702
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:03,919
within this this s and d zone

703
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,799
and the imbalance that's between this

704
00:27:06,799 --> 00:27:08,640
area

705
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,640
but

706
00:27:10,640 --> 00:27:12,880
how do we know if it's not going to go

707
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:14,559
there

708
00:27:14,559 --> 00:27:17,840
we know that by observing if there's

709
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,440
bearish behavior that takes place

710
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,360
anywhere that bearish behavior takes

711
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:26,480
place up here anywhere that we notice it

712
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:27,919
then

713
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:29,760
we'll flip our bias and and that could

714
00:27:29,760 --> 00:27:31,279
be temporary

715
00:27:31,279 --> 00:27:33,039
that bears behavior up here it could

716
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:35,279
certainly be temporary

717
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:37,360
because it can just flip bullish just to

718
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:41,520
come back mitigate this area and then

719
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:43,120
it could flip bare sorry come back

720
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:44,880
mitigate this air and then flip bullish

721
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:48,320
again from this same area and this is

722
00:27:48,320 --> 00:27:49,840
what i'm talking about with multiple

723
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:52,000
trades multiple setups that you could

724
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:52,960
use

725
00:27:52,960 --> 00:27:56,320
you can use multiple setups within just

726
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,720
a day's worth of trading

727
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,039
and not even a day within a couple hours

728
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,440
this is the one minute time frame

729
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:05,600
so between now

730
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:06,960
and

731
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:07,679
and

732
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,679
4 p.m

733
00:28:09,679 --> 00:28:12,159
when you know all volume kind of leaves

734
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:13,919
the market

735
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,559
between now and 4 p.m there's a bunch of

736
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,960
quality setups

737
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:19,919
that

738
00:28:19,919 --> 00:28:21,840
you can get with this

739
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:24,720
a bunch of quality setups

740
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:27,440
you know again we we saw this here we

741
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:29,760
could have took the tap in that area

742
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,240
and took it up to maybe this s and d

743
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:33,760
this probably would have been my partial

744
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:35,279
area y or this would have been the

745
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,320
partial area one because this is

746
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:40,720
um the previous high

747
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:43,200
that we're running from this area so

748
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:45,760
when we run the high we know that we get

749
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:48,000
to pull back into the area

750
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,279
so

751
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:51,600
i'm partially out at here because i know

752
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:53,520
this this is going to come back to me

753
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:55,520
anyway

754
00:28:55,520 --> 00:28:58,399
so if it takes me out at break even

755
00:28:58,399 --> 00:29:00,320
i'm looking for the next setup what

756
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:02,720
happens this is all within let me look

757
00:29:02,720 --> 00:29:04,799
at this this uh

758
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,000
so from the time price came into here

759
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:10,000
to the time that

760
00:29:10,000 --> 00:29:15,039
we got a second entry this is 16 minutes

761
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:16,640
16 minutes

762
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:21,039
two possible entries two possible setups

763
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:22,240
here

764
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:24,080
within 16 minutes

765
00:29:24,080 --> 00:29:26,799
after taking a full set up into this

766
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:28,360
area

767
00:29:28,360 --> 00:29:30,320
161 pips

768
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:33,440
one lot size that's 161 dollars on a 10

769
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:37,720
loss size that's 1610

770
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:41,279
that can certainly

771
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:44,159
work for you short move one minute time

772
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:45,039
frame

773
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,159
this happened in

774
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:52,159
43 minutes this is in no volume

775
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:54,559
this happened in six

776
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,720
so trading in in times where there's

777
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,360
volume that's something that you want to

778
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:00,559
make sure

779
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:02,559
that you're doing so

780
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,640
you know you have faster setups on one

781
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,320
minute

782
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:07,919
this you have to wait a pretty long time

783
00:30:07,919 --> 00:30:10,399
to get to

784
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:11,360
so

785
00:30:11,360 --> 00:30:14,159
you know we have this happen

786
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:17,440
plenty of times around

787
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:20,559
this this map this happens plenty of

788
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:22,320
times

789
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,559
and when this happens you have trades

790
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:27,520
coming from those areas

791
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:30,559
because you you have

792
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,720
you have this retracement

793
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,159
you have a long

794
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,120
going into this retracement from here

795
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:39,520
let's say your stops was were behind you

796
00:30:39,520 --> 00:30:41,120
know the area

797
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:43,520
what did i say i like to see

798
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:44,880
the candle

799
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:47,440
you see this this candle here the

800
00:30:47,440 --> 00:30:49,520
bearish candle went down the next candle

801
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:51,760
opened up

802
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,480
took out the low of the previous candle

803
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:56,480
and then traded above

804
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:57,840
what did i tell you about the areas that

805
00:30:57,840 --> 00:31:00,880
i like to see trades coming out of

806
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:02,960
i like to see that and it gives me

807
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:05,200
confidence to stay in past this high

808
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,080
being ran and to stay in up until maybe

809
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,320
the s and d area that's that's up here

810
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,919
the unmitigated smd zone

811
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:17,600
because i have specific rules to

812
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:20,080
when i'm finding a setup

813
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:23,440
and when i'm executing it

814
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:25,120
so

815
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,679
you know you you have this area that you

816
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,840
could have potentially

817
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:32,880
trade it from 78 pips again 10 lot size

818
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,679
780

819
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:38,480
you know like this is this is making

820
00:31:38,480 --> 00:31:41,120
more than people make in a week

821
00:31:41,120 --> 00:31:43,840
just with these rules and using these

822
00:31:43,840 --> 00:31:46,799
very short movements

823
00:31:46,799 --> 00:31:48,240
because this is

824
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:50,320
this is what six minutes

825
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,080
you made somebody weekly salary in six

826
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:56,720
minutes because of precision

827
00:31:56,799 --> 00:31:59,120
because you chose to go the extra mile

828
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:04,080
and learn this as much as you could

829
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:06,640
and now

830
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:08,640
you know like the these are so easy to

831
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:12,480
find everywhere they're so easy to find

832
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:16,240
like i see people say oh you know uh

833
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:19,600
you know 31 860

834
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:20,880
is

835
00:32:20,880 --> 00:32:22,720
an important area

836
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:25,279
and if price doesn't hold there

837
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,159
then

838
00:32:26,159 --> 00:32:28,480
we're gonna have a huge drop you know

839
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,000
and they and they make their predictions

840
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:32,799
based on the lowest area

841
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:33,919
that

842
00:32:33,919 --> 00:32:35,200
price is in

843
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:37,919
you know currently

844
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:41,279
and if it does run this area

845
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:44,240
yes you may have a drop into this area

846
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,559
here because obviously all of this down

847
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:48,240
here is unmitigated you could have a

848
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:49,600
drop into this area you could have a

849
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,519
drop into this area

850
00:32:51,519 --> 00:32:53,440
but we know that when it runs the low

851
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:54,559
first

852
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:56,880
we got to be careful because

853
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:59,360
it'll run the low and then have a huge

854
00:32:59,360 --> 00:33:02,320
push back to the top side

855
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,640
so it's best not to get in on an

856
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:07,039
impulsive trade like that

857
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:08,559
but this is the stuff that people are

858
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:09,760
teaching

859
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,840
you know other traders to to trade with

860
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:12,960
i know um

861
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:14,559
you know i i haven't started making

862
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:16,960
short videos yet explaining this but i

863
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:18,880
do want to make shorter videos that you

864
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,760
guys could go over and learn

865
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:25,440
more and more from um to be able to

866
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:26,799
you know time

867
00:33:26,799 --> 00:33:28,640
these these different entries in the

868
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,120
market is you you got to have a bunch of

869
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:33,440
exposure to it truthfully speaking like

870
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,440
over and over you have to have hours of

871
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:38,159
it

872
00:33:38,159 --> 00:33:39,600
in the room

873
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:42,640
sorry i am

874
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:45,039
i had to uh

875
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,120
get out the kitchen he loves rummaging

876
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:48,799
things in the kitchen

877
00:33:48,799 --> 00:33:52,480
so he goes to his playroom but um

878
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:55,760
you know you you you have this

879
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,519
to where this happens and look look at

880
00:33:57,519 --> 00:33:59,039
what this has given us

881
00:33:59,039 --> 00:34:01,360
this hasn't given us a high yet

882
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:04,320
the price broke above

883
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:06,080
so because this hasn't given us a high

884
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,640
as of yet

885
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:14,079
we're still bullish on this

886
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,480
this is the last high this gave us the

887
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,599
low

888
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:20,480
there's no high above this

889
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,719
just a bunch of wicks

890
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:26,239
now some people see wicks as rejections

891
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,039
like right here

892
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:34,599
some people would take this area

893
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:38,079
and be like okay this is a this is a

894
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:40,000
major rejection area and they'll go like

895
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,239
this

896
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,639
there was some support here

897
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,079
broke through

898
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:49,040
some major rejection area

899
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,359
and their rules are simply if it gets

900
00:34:51,359 --> 00:34:54,320
rejected from here once and trade away

901
00:34:54,320 --> 00:34:56,480
if there's a second rejection

902
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,320
you take that rejection

903
00:34:58,320 --> 00:34:59,680
out of the area

904
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,520
and you target this low

905
00:35:03,520 --> 00:35:05,200
so

906
00:35:05,200 --> 00:35:07,760
they're taking cells from here and

907
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:10,079
they're putting their stops just above

908
00:35:10,079 --> 00:35:13,920
an area you know like somewhere up here

909
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:16,640
like maybe the first first high above

910
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:19,359
this or possibly even the the last high

911
00:35:19,359 --> 00:35:20,640
that's there

912
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:24,240
and they're they're hoping that

913
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:27,280
the trade leaves the area here

914
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:28,640
they're hoping that the trade leaves

915
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:32,240
this area and

916
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:36,240
doesn't come up here to their stop loss

917
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,760
so then they see price breaking above

918
00:35:37,760 --> 00:35:41,200
the area and it's like all right chad um

919
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:44,480
you know this could just be a fake out

920
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,480
it just might poke through and then come

921
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:47,760
back down

922
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,359
you know like that they're making up all

923
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:50,480
these different

924
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:53,280
things as to what price could do in this

925
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,720
area

926
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:59,599
and it's all off of their own opinion

927
00:35:59,599 --> 00:36:01,760
what price can do

928
00:36:01,760 --> 00:36:03,280
it's not off of

929
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:08,320
what is price showing us right now

930
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:10,560
what is price showing us

931
00:36:10,560 --> 00:36:12,160
and what did i mention when price wants

932
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,880
to go bearish this is this is not

933
00:36:14,880 --> 00:36:15,839
like

934
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,680
i'm not ever

935
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:19,520
supporting this style of trading

936
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:21,920
anything so even if this does go

937
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:23,359
in this direction

938
00:36:23,359 --> 00:36:25,839
you know i'm just giving an example of

939
00:36:25,839 --> 00:36:27,839
it i do not trade this way and i do not

940
00:36:27,839 --> 00:36:30,000
support this type of trading

941
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:31,280
because

942
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:34,160
it it lacks the skill and the awareness

943
00:36:34,160 --> 00:36:35,760
to sit there

944
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:38,480
and pay attention to what's happening in

945
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:39,599
real time

946
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:41,440
we're just saying okay it's going to

947
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:43,599
come here reject come back here and then

948
00:36:43,599 --> 00:36:44,800
we're going to trade it coming out of

949
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,280
this area

950
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,520
that's very easy

951
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,320
to

952
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:52,880
to analyze and and to hope

953
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,119
that this setup works

954
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:58,240
that's very easy for anybody coming in

955
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,320
oh look at the areas where it's support

956
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:03,200
and in turn resistance

957
00:37:03,200 --> 00:37:05,040
it's very easy for people so people are

958
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,760
gonna be more inclined to to learn this

959
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,480
way

960
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:10,720
and trade this way

961
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:11,599
but

962
00:37:11,599 --> 00:37:13,599
there are other ways

963
00:37:13,599 --> 00:37:14,960
to

964
00:37:14,960 --> 00:37:17,280
get to the same conclusion

965
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,200
up here

966
00:37:19,200 --> 00:37:20,720
where

967
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:24,000
you know when you get to that conclusion

968
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,920
you're sure

969
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:28,160
of the trade coming out of this area

970
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,000
you're not just hoping and that's why

971
00:37:30,000 --> 00:37:31,520
when when they have those little things

972
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,160
here this is exactly what they do when

973
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:35,359
they have these little things here they

974
00:37:35,359 --> 00:37:38,240
go just like this

975
00:37:41,200 --> 00:37:43,200
and i and i see a couple traders do it

976
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:47,560
too they go just like this

977
00:37:52,079 --> 00:37:53,520
they go like this

978
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,040
right here

979
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:57,839
and i go oh yeah chad we partialed out

980
00:37:57,839 --> 00:37:59,200
right here

981
00:37:59,200 --> 00:38:02,000
at you know what whatever whatever it is

982
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,440
21 pips

983
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:06,160
21 pips let's go chat everybody is

984
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,560
writing w's in the chat or or whatever

985
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,480
it is that they're putting in the chat

986
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:11,760
and

987
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:14,000
this is this is what they're doing this

988
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:17,200
is how they're teaching people to trade

989
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,800
now it's just runners we're going to let

990
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,320
the runners run

991
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:22,320
yeah it was a good day

992
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,640
with just this

993
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,280
this is the quality of

994
00:38:27,280 --> 00:38:29,040
you know like the years of experience

995
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,040
that people take to learn things in this

996
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:35,280
industry they come in this industry and

997
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:37,280
they look at this

998
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:39,839
they start trading this way

999
00:38:39,839 --> 00:38:41,280
and they catch a little bit and people

1000
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,280
like yeah made so much money on that

1001
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:45,839
movement you know it's 20 pips so if you

1002
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:49,040
were trading on a 10 lot size with 20

1003
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:52,480
pips you know you have 200 bucks

1004
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:55,920
but if you were trading on 100 lot size

1005
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:57,040
then

1006
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:00,800
you know you have two thousand dollars

1007
00:39:00,800 --> 00:39:03,359
and when i personally trade i trade on a

1008
00:39:03,359 --> 00:39:05,040
40 lot size

1009
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:07,040
so you can understand

1010
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,680
the numbers that work out

1011
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,359
you know with

1012
00:39:11,359 --> 00:39:14,079
with this

1013
00:39:14,079 --> 00:39:16,240
it all comes from

1014
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:19,440
having that particular skill set

1015
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:21,599
to be able to understand that this is

1016
00:39:21,599 --> 00:39:23,680
not the way to trade

1017
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:26,560
because if this was we we could teach

1018
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:27,839
five-year-olds this and they could

1019
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:30,800
retire their parents

1020
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,720
just doing this

1021
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:35,280
i see them do this in in in roblox and

1022
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:37,280
in in

1023
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:38,480
in a

1024
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:41,200
minecraft this is child's play

1025
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:43,920
that's not how you trade at all

1026
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,680
and that's not how you teach people to

1027
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:48,000
trade

1028
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,599
because what indication do we have that

1029
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,400
price could potentially be coming down

1030
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:57,280
we look at what price is doing right now

1031
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,680
in this moment

1032
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:02,079
and we look at the areas that price

1033
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,160
might have tapped into

1034
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,760
so

1035
00:40:05,760 --> 00:40:08,400
if you want to take a look at

1036
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,640
what price did and

1037
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,560
and where it went

1038
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:14,400
we see

1039
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:17,280
that price hit our supply area right

1040
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:18,800
here

1041
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:21,520
this cluster of candles here

1042
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:25,640
price hit our supply area

1043
00:40:27,119 --> 00:40:29,359
tapped

1044
00:40:29,359 --> 00:40:32,320
then traded away

1045
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,920
now

1046
00:40:33,920 --> 00:40:36,480
when we see all of these trade all of

1047
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:39,839
these these you know candles around our

1048
00:40:39,839 --> 00:40:42,240
entry

1049
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:45,599
seven minutes worth of candles

1050
00:40:45,599 --> 00:40:48,800
you know a lot of the times we may see

1051
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:50,960
you know five minutes ten minutes

1052
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,400
sometimes just

1053
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,200
going sideways in that area

1054
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:56,400
before

1055
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:57,920
price ends up

1056
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,079
taking us the other way

1057
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:01,280
but

1058
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:04,160
we don't we don't get in because it

1059
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:07,359
tapped our area because the same way it

1060
00:41:07,359 --> 00:41:09,040
tapped our area is the same way it can

1061
00:41:09,040 --> 00:41:11,839
go right through it

1062
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:14,319
so we don't get in when price is tapping

1063
00:41:14,319 --> 00:41:17,760
the area that's catching a falling knife

1064
00:41:17,760 --> 00:41:19,760
where we're getting in

1065
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:20,560
is

1066
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:23,200
when we start to see

1067
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:27,200
the bearish behavior that we discussed

1068
00:41:27,200 --> 00:41:31,280
when we start to see that playing out

1069
00:41:31,280 --> 00:41:33,599
because what what might we have in this

1070
00:41:33,599 --> 00:41:34,400
area

1071
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,880
if price wants to go down

1072
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:39,440
what might we have

1073
00:41:39,440 --> 00:41:40,720
in this area

1074
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,720
what we may have

1075
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,880
is

1076
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:46,400
price shift

1077
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:48,880
out of the area

1078
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:52,480
let's say it shifts out of the area

1079
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:55,040
runs the low

1080
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:58,560
that we have as an important low

1081
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:01,200
then it could take us back

1082
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:04,079
into the area

1083
00:42:05,359 --> 00:42:07,599
and then take us out of the area

1084
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:10,079
like that

1085
00:42:10,800 --> 00:42:13,040
so

1086
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,079
if we had a run of this low yes

1087
00:42:18,079 --> 00:42:20,960
that that is something that

1088
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:24,000
you know we should consider doing

1089
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:26,800
when taking this trade not just because

1090
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:28,800
it tapped here

1091
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:30,720
because we had

1092
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:33,760
rules that we followed in terms of if

1093
00:42:33,760 --> 00:42:36,160
price produces this here's how we

1094
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:39,119
respond to it

1095
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:40,720
and

1096
00:42:40,720 --> 00:42:43,520
this is what you get

1097
00:42:43,520 --> 00:42:46,240
this is how you get safer entries into

1098
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:48,480
these areas now

1099
00:42:48,480 --> 00:42:52,160
although i had mentioned that this is

1100
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,079
you know a um

1101
00:42:54,079 --> 00:42:58,560
a supply area you could also adjust it

1102
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,720
to this here

1103
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,520
why because we have this low

1104
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,520
and we have this high

1105
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:08,640
so within this entire area

1106
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,960
between this low and high when price

1107
00:43:10,960 --> 00:43:14,079
trades away from it you have to look

1108
00:43:14,079 --> 00:43:17,520
and and get an idea of where price

1109
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:20,319
usually reacts off of

1110
00:43:20,319 --> 00:43:21,359
and

1111
00:43:21,359 --> 00:43:23,920
whatever area while you're back testing

1112
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:26,720
you usually see price react off of

1113
00:43:26,720 --> 00:43:29,119
you would go and start to utilize that

1114
00:43:29,119 --> 00:43:31,520
area on these pullbacks

1115
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,680
and not just the pullbacks you would

1116
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:36,640
utilize this area down here in this area

1117
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:39,200
that wasn't touched you would utilize it

1118
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,319
down here so you already have the

1119
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,720
anticipation of areas set up but it

1120
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:46,640
doesn't necessarily mean you're you're

1121
00:43:46,640 --> 00:43:48,960
catching a trade from there

1122
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,680
you're watching to see what is price

1123
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,000
doing in that area

1124
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,359
before i take a trade from there

1125
00:43:57,359 --> 00:43:59,119
is it giving me

1126
00:43:59,119 --> 00:44:01,359
any type of of

1127
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:03,760
bullish behavior

1128
00:44:03,760 --> 00:44:07,319
coming out of here

1129
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:09,359
you know is it giving me any type of

1130
00:44:09,359 --> 00:44:12,079
bearish behavior coming out of here

1131
00:44:12,079 --> 00:44:13,359
and

1132
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:16,319
when you start to notice that

1133
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:19,040
then you start to see that

1134
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:20,800
you know it lines up

1135
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,160
and as i mentioned down here

1136
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,400
i said that usually

1137
00:44:26,400 --> 00:44:27,200
when

1138
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:29,440
you get strong rejections out of certain

1139
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,960
areas

1140
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:32,960
you usually have

1141
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,480
a double

1142
00:44:34,480 --> 00:44:35,599
entry

1143
00:44:35,599 --> 00:44:38,000
or or a double tap

1144
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:40,560
within this area

1145
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:42,960
so you get the double tap

1146
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,400
and then

1147
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:46,720
price takes us out

1148
00:44:46,720 --> 00:44:48,640
usually that's what you get you know

1149
00:44:48,640 --> 00:44:50,720
when there's like a a strong push out of

1150
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:52,319
a particular area

1151
00:44:52,319 --> 00:44:54,319
um

1152
00:44:54,319 --> 00:44:56,319
we we had this

1153
00:44:56,319 --> 00:44:59,520
you know where we got in here

1154
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:02,400
then price came back up towards the

1155
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:05,839
entry near the entry

1156
00:45:05,920 --> 00:45:08,000
and remember how i mentioned you can

1157
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,720
catch this by up to this area

1158
00:45:10,720 --> 00:45:12,640
but you want to be mindful of what

1159
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,040
happens in this area because then when

1160
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:16,839
you start to see

1161
00:45:16,839 --> 00:45:20,800
some bearish behavior start to take

1162
00:45:20,800 --> 00:45:22,160
place here

1163
00:45:22,160 --> 00:45:25,040
then you will go ahead and take the

1164
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:28,440
trade out

1165
00:45:36,480 --> 00:45:40,400
yeah you you'll start to see this

1166
00:45:43,119 --> 00:45:45,680
you start to see this

1167
00:45:45,680 --> 00:45:47,839
so

1168
00:45:48,800 --> 00:45:51,760
we have this

1169
00:45:52,160 --> 00:45:55,119
as our high

1170
00:45:59,200 --> 00:46:02,960
price shifted above here

1171
00:46:03,680 --> 00:46:06,640
this being actually let let me

1172
00:46:06,640 --> 00:46:09,200
let me use this and

1173
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:12,400
and actually mark it

1174
00:46:12,839 --> 00:46:16,160
out uh

1175
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,240
this

1176
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:22,000
i should have probably used this let me

1177
00:46:27,280 --> 00:46:30,480
so you have here

1178
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:34,000
so you can take this

1179
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,560
and this

1180
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:44,160
this didn't have a closure to this

1181
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:53,680
and we have a tap here

1182
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,520
yeah let me just double check

1183
00:47:02,880 --> 00:47:07,040
actually this might be it here

1184
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:11,040
wait let me see sorry i'm just checking

1185
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,160
the level so i can give you guys um

1186
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,440
accurate information

1187
00:47:17,599 --> 00:47:20,400
uh so

1188
00:47:20,400 --> 00:47:22,079
you have this

1189
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:22,839
this

1190
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:24,560
is

1191
00:47:24,560 --> 00:47:26,480
low

1192
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:28,960
this is a high

1193
00:47:28,960 --> 00:47:31,280
this is a low

1194
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,240
now it's here

1195
00:47:35,520 --> 00:47:38,920
so it's

1196
00:47:53,680 --> 00:47:58,960
here but with an intermediary structure

1197
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,480
i'm conflicted because this candle here

1198
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:16,560
gave us both a

1199
00:48:16,560 --> 00:48:20,319
no i'll keep this

1200
00:48:20,319 --> 00:48:22,880
yeah i'll keep this so this is the low

1201
00:48:22,880 --> 00:48:25,280
that i'm expecting to be ran this

1202
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:26,720
important low

1203
00:48:26,720 --> 00:48:29,359
if this low is ran then we could have a

1204
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:31,440
reversal to the downside

1205
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:33,680
if this low is not ran

1206
00:48:33,680 --> 00:48:34,720
then

1207
00:48:34,720 --> 00:48:36,400
we're just going to continue higher out

1208
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,400
of this area the same way that we did

1209
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,040
this area

1210
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:44,079
because you see it kind of looks the

1211
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:46,480
same the slanting upward

1212
00:48:46,480 --> 00:48:49,040
you get a pullback and then price shifts

1213
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:50,000
higher

1214
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:52,240
you have the slant again

1215
00:48:52,240 --> 00:48:53,359
upward

1216
00:48:53,359 --> 00:48:55,040
you get a pullback and there's a

1217
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,040
possibility that price ends up shifting

1218
00:48:57,040 --> 00:48:58,480
higher

1219
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:00,880
above this

1220
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:03,599
so if price shifts above this

1221
00:49:03,599 --> 00:49:07,280
we have the possibility of

1222
00:49:07,760 --> 00:49:10,559
let me see

1223
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:14,079
there's a possibility that this high is

1224
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:17,079
ran

1225
00:49:20,160 --> 00:49:22,960
and what happens when we run highs

1226
00:49:22,960 --> 00:49:25,040
we run the high

1227
00:49:25,040 --> 00:49:26,640
and then

1228
00:49:26,640 --> 00:49:29,359
we pull back into the area and possibly

1229
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:30,559
continue

1230
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:33,760
but that's just what our bias is

1231
00:49:33,760 --> 00:49:36,400
we actually look at price to see what

1232
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:38,240
price is doing

1233
00:49:38,240 --> 00:49:39,839
when it happens

1234
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:41,599
and that will determine whether we're

1235
00:49:41,599 --> 00:49:45,599
taking the trade from that area or not

1236
00:49:45,599 --> 00:49:48,160
and the structure at 10 30 but the

1237
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:51,119
structure and long entry at 10.50

1238
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:53,040
is a little confusing

1239
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,720
1050 entry

1240
00:49:54,720 --> 00:49:57,200
is based on structure to the left

1241
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:00,160
the 10 50 entry that's

1242
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:01,839
here

1243
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,359
oh you're saying that you're you're not

1244
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:04,960
understanding

1245
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:07,280
why there was an entry here anthony

1246
00:50:07,280 --> 00:50:09,680
correct

1247
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:14,079
i just want to make sure um

1248
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,800
because if it's this entry we use this

1249
00:50:16,800 --> 00:50:19,440
entry on intermediary structure not

1250
00:50:19,440 --> 00:50:21,200
necessarily here

1251
00:50:21,200 --> 00:50:22,079
this

1252
00:50:22,079 --> 00:50:26,079
this trade we were taking into this area

1253
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:28,480
because this was a possible area that

1254
00:50:28,480 --> 00:50:31,440
price could react from to the upside so

1255
00:50:31,440 --> 00:50:33,839
that's why we took this trade here

1256
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:36,559
and this particular entry

1257
00:50:36,559 --> 00:50:38,240
right here

1258
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:41,520
is because we were looking at

1259
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:43,680
um into i don't know if you were here

1260
00:50:43,680 --> 00:50:45,119
during the explanation but we were

1261
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:46,160
looking at

1262
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:48,960
you know intermediary structure

1263
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:49,760
so

1264
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:52,240
if you look at these these wicks these

1265
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:55,280
wicks are highs and lows too

1266
00:50:55,280 --> 00:50:57,200
these these wicks that i'm drawing this

1267
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:59,280
line on these are highs and lows too

1268
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,599
so when we have these highs and lows

1269
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:03,520
coming down if you go to like the second

1270
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:06,079
time frame you'll see it exactly like

1271
00:51:06,079 --> 00:51:08,880
this whole thing but it would just be

1272
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,800
within this area when you come back to

1273
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,359
the one minute time frame so

1274
00:51:13,359 --> 00:51:16,000
we had the run

1275
00:51:16,000 --> 00:51:19,920
of this high right here

1276
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:23,119
we ran that high breakup structure to

1277
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:24,800
the top side

1278
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,880
so when we get that break we're

1279
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:29,680
anticipating a pullback back into the

1280
00:51:29,680 --> 00:51:30,720
area

1281
00:51:30,720 --> 00:51:33,359
and then we're taking it long

1282
00:51:33,359 --> 00:51:34,160
and

1283
00:51:34,160 --> 00:51:37,280
where do we take these long to we take

1284
00:51:37,280 --> 00:51:38,800
these long to

1285
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:41,760
the these lungs to unmitigated areas

1286
00:51:41,760 --> 00:51:45,040
that price could potentially react from

1287
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,680
that's where we're going so with with

1288
00:51:47,680 --> 00:51:50,240
this in particular the reason why i

1289
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:52,800
pointed to sorry it's actually here this

1290
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:54,480
area is because

1291
00:51:54,480 --> 00:51:56,160
if you look at this

1292
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,680
this right here is

1293
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:02,880
this is supply

1294
00:52:02,960 --> 00:52:05,200
this is a supplier this one wick right

1295
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,079
here

1296
00:52:06,079 --> 00:52:08,960
is the supply area

1297
00:52:08,960 --> 00:52:11,440
there was no mitigation so you know

1298
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,160
price shifted towards the downside

1299
00:52:14,160 --> 00:52:14,960
and

1300
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:16,960
the next candle that opened did not go

1301
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:20,319
into the area it traded away from it

1302
00:52:20,319 --> 00:52:23,119
so because it traded away from it it's

1303
00:52:23,119 --> 00:52:26,400
considered a supply area it wasn't it's

1304
00:52:26,400 --> 00:52:28,640
it's an unmitigated area an untouched

1305
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:30,240
area

1306
00:52:30,240 --> 00:52:33,280
and you also have this here

1307
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:34,400
as well

1308
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:37,520
but these are more so like the the

1309
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:40,800
smaller ones these are more so on the

1310
00:52:40,800 --> 00:52:43,119
seconds time frame the previous time

1311
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:44,000
frame

1312
00:52:44,000 --> 00:52:45,920
you know like like something lower than

1313
00:52:45,920 --> 00:52:46,720
this

1314
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:48,720
so if you were to go to i don't know

1315
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:50,079
this is the one minute maybe you wanted

1316
00:52:50,079 --> 00:52:52,240
to go to one second

1317
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:54,800
on the one second within these areas if

1318
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:57,359
you drew these lines and went to the one

1319
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:00,319
second you would see this as larger

1320
00:53:00,319 --> 00:53:03,520
areas like this with a bunch of you know

1321
00:53:03,520 --> 00:53:05,680
pullbacks going to the area that is

1322
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:06,640
going in

1323
00:53:06,640 --> 00:53:07,920
so

1324
00:53:07,920 --> 00:53:11,040
with this we we noticed that based on

1325
00:53:11,040 --> 00:53:12,960
candlestick structure

1326
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:16,000
not you know secondary structure or any

1327
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:18,480
type of overall structure it was just

1328
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,359
within candle structure itself

1329
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:23,200
but we have mentioned that if we saw

1330
00:53:23,200 --> 00:53:25,200
some bullish behavior happening down

1331
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:28,160
here then we would look to take a trade

1332
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,640
back up but this happens all over the

1333
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:33,359
map happens down here happens down here

1334
00:53:33,359 --> 00:53:35,839
you know it happened up here this is how

1335
00:53:35,839 --> 00:53:38,480
we got involved into these trades

1336
00:53:38,480 --> 00:53:39,520
because

1337
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,760
where they were happening the areas that

1338
00:53:41,760 --> 00:53:43,760
they were happening in

1339
00:53:43,760 --> 00:53:46,240
this is how we got involved so yeah this

1340
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:46,960
is

1341
00:53:46,960 --> 00:53:48,880
it's it's structure but

1342
00:53:48,880 --> 00:53:51,280
this is structure really on a lower time

1343
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:53,920
frame and you probably have to be a

1344
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:55,520
little more advanced

1345
00:53:55,520 --> 00:53:57,920
sometimes to to be able to

1346
00:53:57,920 --> 00:53:59,599
monitor those time frames because they

1347
00:53:59,599 --> 00:54:03,280
move so fast oh my gosh like could you

1348
00:54:03,280 --> 00:54:06,720
and and it doesn't even look like it's

1349
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:08,960
it's um it's candlesticks it's just like

1350
00:54:08,960 --> 00:54:10,880
little lines you know little green and

1351
00:54:10,880 --> 00:54:12,319
red lines really

1352
00:54:12,319 --> 00:54:14,160
but if you use this um

1353
00:54:14,160 --> 00:54:16,480
no gap candle then it would create a

1354
00:54:16,480 --> 00:54:19,359
full candle on that time frame

1355
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:21,440
but if you if you use that time frame it

1356
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:22,880
takes a lot of getting used to an

1357
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,559
adjustment it's like a crash course

1358
00:54:24,559 --> 00:54:27,800
going to the the one second it moves

1359
00:54:27,800 --> 00:54:31,119
extremely fast so you just want to make

1360
00:54:31,119 --> 00:54:32,559
sure that

1361
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:35,599
you know you can handle price moving so

1362
00:54:35,599 --> 00:54:37,680
fast in that direction so again i

1363
00:54:37,680 --> 00:54:39,359
mentioned that these these little wicks

1364
00:54:39,359 --> 00:54:41,140
here are um

1365
00:54:41,140 --> 00:54:42,319
[Music]

1366
00:54:42,319 --> 00:54:44,480
you know s and d zones on on smaller

1367
00:54:44,480 --> 00:54:47,040
time frames so what do you have you have

1368
00:54:47,040 --> 00:54:50,400
when price goes into this s and d zone

1369
00:54:50,400 --> 00:54:53,920
you get a reaction out of it

1370
00:54:53,920 --> 00:54:55,520
look this wick this candle with this

1371
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:57,040
wick came up in here

1372
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:59,200
this one came down and went out of that

1373
00:54:59,200 --> 00:55:00,319
area

1374
00:55:00,319 --> 00:55:02,800
some people are just taking trades from

1375
00:55:02,800 --> 00:55:04,720
here people would with you might have

1376
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,880
people with zero spreads

1377
00:55:06,880 --> 00:55:09,200
they're just taking that

1378
00:55:09,200 --> 00:55:11,520
that six pips could be six thousand

1379
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:13,520
easily

1380
00:55:13,520 --> 00:55:14,400
if

1381
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:17,040
you knew how to to trade these areas and

1382
00:55:17,040 --> 00:55:20,640
trade the reactions away from this that

1383
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:23,040
six six grand easily

1384
00:55:23,040 --> 00:55:24,960
just on a little small move like that of

1385
00:55:24,960 --> 00:55:28,000
course you need more capital but

1386
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,079
when you look at these s and d zones as

1387
00:55:30,079 --> 00:55:32,720
i mentioned in in some of my other

1388
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:34,880
videos when you look at these s and d

1389
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:36,160
zones

1390
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:38,640
oftentimes you have it to where there is

1391
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,839
a reaction when price touches it

1392
00:55:41,839 --> 00:55:43,440
so remember how we mentioned that this

1393
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:45,920
was our s d zone here this was our

1394
00:55:45,920 --> 00:55:47,440
supply area

1395
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,119
you have price reject from it and look

1396
00:55:49,119 --> 00:55:52,400
at this rejection 61 pip rejection

1397
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,880
you get a six pip rejection from a

1398
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:56,319
second's time frame

1399
00:55:56,319 --> 00:55:59,839
but here you get a 61 pip rejection just

1400
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:04,319
from the zone from the zone alone

1401
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,079
not trying to be dr seuss or anything

1402
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:08,880
but you you get a a reaction from that

1403
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,359
zone where you could get a quick scalp

1404
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,680
off of

1405
00:56:14,079 --> 00:56:15,280
so

1406
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,760
these areas can definitely help you with

1407
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:18,799
that

1408
00:56:18,799 --> 00:56:21,680
uh i'm always looking for an abcd and

1409
00:56:21,680 --> 00:56:23,119
didn't

1410
00:56:23,119 --> 00:56:24,960
see it there

1411
00:56:24,960 --> 00:56:27,520
like the short entry things oh okay yeah

1412
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:29,599
no i i understand what you're saying um

1413
00:56:29,599 --> 00:56:32,160
that's what like you know the i believe

1414
00:56:32,160 --> 00:56:33,920
it's elliott wave theory or something

1415
00:56:33,920 --> 00:56:36,799
like that um so for me

1416
00:56:36,799 --> 00:56:39,359
those theories just just make it easier

1417
00:56:39,359 --> 00:56:41,599
to spot certain things but ultimately

1418
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:44,880
you want to like grow out of that and

1419
00:56:44,880 --> 00:56:47,760
just start to look at it from

1420
00:56:47,760 --> 00:56:49,680
candlestick structure when you're

1421
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,280
looking at candlesticks when you're

1422
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:53,920
reading so fine-tuned

1423
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:54,799
that

1424
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:56,799
you can get an idea of what could

1425
00:56:56,799 --> 00:56:58,640
possibly happen with

1426
00:56:58,640 --> 00:57:00,240
candlesticks

1427
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:01,599
then

1428
00:57:01,599 --> 00:57:04,400
and that's on a microscopic level then

1429
00:57:04,400 --> 00:57:07,280
you know as a whole things start to just

1430
00:57:07,280 --> 00:57:09,040
you know add up and become a lot

1431
00:57:09,040 --> 00:57:10,400
different for you

1432
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,000
starts to look different you know

1433
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,119
there's just

1434
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:14,799
a bunch of stuff that

1435
00:57:14,799 --> 00:57:17,119
a bunch of possibilities that you have

1436
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:18,880
just knowing that you can apply the

1437
00:57:18,880 --> 00:57:23,119
fine-tuned candlestick structure to

1438
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:26,079
you know the the overall structure

1439
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,720
because now if you go to like the 15

1440
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:30,880
minute now you could use candlestick

1441
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,720
structure here in the 15 minute

1442
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:37,440
and you could start using this for

1443
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:39,680
you know trading the same way

1444
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,720
so if you have you have this high

1445
00:57:42,720 --> 00:57:44,960
i mean you have this low sorry this high

1446
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:46,240
is presented

1447
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:48,720
you have this that comes back down

1448
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,799
and doesn't take out the low

1449
00:57:50,799 --> 00:57:52,720
but we don't have a new high created

1450
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:54,960
because a high didn't go above this

1451
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:56,559
so when a high goes above this it

1452
00:57:56,559 --> 00:57:58,319
validates this low

1453
00:57:58,319 --> 00:57:59,200
and

1454
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:01,359
when this low

1455
00:58:01,359 --> 00:58:03,040
is broken

1456
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,280
then you'll have a pull back into this

1457
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:08,000
area and in a continuation outside of it

1458
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:09,680
and that's how you read it on

1459
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:11,920
candlesticks

1460
00:58:11,920 --> 00:58:14,240
so if this if if this doesn't give us

1461
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:15,839
another high this is not the low that

1462
00:58:15,839 --> 00:58:17,599
we're looking for to be broken this is

1463
00:58:17,599 --> 00:58:18,799
the load that we're looking for to be

1464
00:58:18,799 --> 00:58:20,480
broken

1465
00:58:20,480 --> 00:58:21,839
and if you can learn that with

1466
00:58:21,839 --> 00:58:23,280
candlesticks

1467
00:58:23,280 --> 00:58:24,480
then

1468
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:25,520
you know

1469
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,359
when when you're trading on on like a

1470
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:29,280
one minute time frame and you're overall

1471
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:31,680
looking for like structure within this

1472
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:35,760
then you start to get a better idea of

1473
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:38,319
you know what's possibly happening

1474
00:58:38,319 --> 00:58:40,640
um in price and you can catch these

1475
00:58:40,640 --> 00:58:42,400
longer moves from because some people

1476
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:45,200
think the one minute time frame is a

1477
00:58:45,200 --> 00:58:46,559
time frame that

1478
00:58:46,559 --> 00:58:48,799
you know you trade like very short

1479
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:51,040
scalps from they think it's it's like

1480
00:58:51,040 --> 00:58:52,319
that

1481
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:53,760
you know you're you're in and out just

1482
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:55,440
within a couple seconds oh that's a

1483
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:57,760
scalp there okay

1484
00:58:57,760 --> 00:58:59,520
oh yeah i got a short move there you

1485
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:01,520
know like that's all they're doing

1486
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:03,200
all right 10 pips i'm out that's good

1487
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,799
i'm good with that they do that exactly

1488
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:08,799
and a lot of it is because they don't

1489
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,359
actually have an idea of

1490
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:13,280
you know where price is going have an

1491
00:59:13,280 --> 00:59:15,040
idea of structure

1492
00:59:15,040 --> 00:59:16,559
have an idea of

1493
00:59:16,559 --> 00:59:20,000
what is our target

1494
00:59:20,000 --> 00:59:23,520
and this area was our target

1495
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,839
and when we got to our target

1496
00:59:25,839 --> 00:59:28,160
now we look to see if there was some

1497
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:31,280
bullish behavior that was happening

1498
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:33,280
and that lets us know to get out so if

1499
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:35,119
you were in this trade and you were

1500
00:59:35,119 --> 00:59:37,839
coming down to here and we came all the

1501
00:59:37,839 --> 00:59:41,520
way here but ended up flipping back up

1502
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,599
we got a retracement back

1503
00:59:45,599 --> 00:59:47,599
sorry we got a retracement

1504
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:50,160
right here

1505
00:59:50,160 --> 00:59:54,000
so now this becomes where you get out

1506
00:59:54,000 --> 00:59:55,760
of course this is not going to just come

1507
00:59:55,760 --> 00:59:58,720
straight back and hit your stop loss

1508
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,799
unless like some type of high volume

1509
01:00:00,799 --> 01:00:02,319
news happened or whatever it is of

1510
01:00:02,319 --> 01:00:03,520
course it's not going to come back there

1511
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:04,880
and do that

1512
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,640
but

1513
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:08,240
you'll have it to where price will give

1514
01:00:08,240 --> 01:00:11,119
you an area or a landing pad for you to

1515
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:12,640
get out

1516
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:15,599
and not have to get out short of profit

1517
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:18,640
at 64 pips you were able to come back

1518
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,720
and get out at

1519
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:23,440
you know 167.

1520
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,599
so almost double of what you would have

1521
01:00:25,599 --> 01:00:29,200
got out if you saw this high right here

1522
01:00:29,200 --> 01:00:32,319
so you you create rules to it

1523
01:00:32,319 --> 01:00:34,000
i went back and see the structure on the

1524
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:36,160
five second chart yes that's good you

1525
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:38,319
know you you could definitely

1526
01:00:38,319 --> 01:00:40,640
and anything that i say go back and test

1527
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:42,880
it because it's you're gonna see it in

1528
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:44,079
real time

1529
01:00:44,079 --> 01:00:46,160
like go back and look at whatever it is

1530
01:00:46,160 --> 01:00:49,280
that i explain go and reproduce it for

1531
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:51,839
yourself and you're going to see results

1532
01:00:51,839 --> 01:00:53,920
you don't have to pay for this you don't

1533
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:54,960
have to

1534
01:00:54,960 --> 01:00:57,440
you know have any conversations with me

1535
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:58,799
about it you don't need to talk to

1536
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:01,040
anybody just taking these principles and

1537
01:01:01,040 --> 01:01:03,200
these concepts that i teach and i'm

1538
01:01:03,200 --> 01:01:06,160
telling you trading will become so

1539
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:07,880
simple for you

1540
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,720
extremely simple for you

1541
01:01:10,720 --> 01:01:12,720
you know it doesn't have to be hard

1542
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:15,359
learning this is hard yes yes it is oh

1543
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:16,960
my gosh i

1544
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:18,880
i remember the times where

1545
01:01:18,880 --> 01:01:20,240
where i would just

1546
01:01:20,240 --> 01:01:23,040
stare at charts for hours now every now

1547
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:24,559
and again i'll just go back and look at

1548
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:26,079
a chart and be like okay that's probably

1549
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,200
going to happen and just draw something

1550
01:01:29,200 --> 01:01:31,760
and then go back and and take a peek at

1551
01:01:31,760 --> 01:01:33,920
whether it actually happened like i do

1552
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:37,040
that on a lot of different um

1553
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:39,680
pairs that that i don't necessarily

1554
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:40,799
trade

1555
01:01:40,799 --> 01:01:44,880
you know like here's gold right here

1556
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:46,319
let me show you the same thing because

1557
01:01:46,319 --> 01:01:48,799
this works on everything not just um

1558
01:01:48,799 --> 01:01:51,520
forex this is on stocks this is on uh

1559
01:01:51,520 --> 01:01:53,680
commodities this is on everything like

1560
01:01:53,680 --> 01:01:56,079
futures all of that crypto

1561
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,920
whatever you want to trade

1562
01:01:57,920 --> 01:02:00,400
this all works on it

1563
01:02:00,400 --> 01:02:04,240
it works the same exact way

1564
01:02:04,240 --> 01:02:07,760
the same exact way so

1565
01:02:07,760 --> 01:02:11,040
you know we we have it to where

1566
01:02:11,040 --> 01:02:12,559
we get

1567
01:02:12,559 --> 01:02:14,799
this we have this high

1568
01:02:14,799 --> 01:02:17,119
then we get another low put in

1569
01:02:17,119 --> 01:02:19,599
and what do we do we take out

1570
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:20,559
the high

1571
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:23,200
that was validated by the new low that

1572
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:24,640
was put in

1573
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:25,440
so

1574
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:27,040
we had price

1575
01:02:27,040 --> 01:02:30,079
come up around here i was expecting

1576
01:02:30,079 --> 01:02:32,960
after price went above this

1577
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:35,760
i was expecting price to come back into

1578
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,319
this area

1579
01:02:38,319 --> 01:02:40,960
but it didn't

1580
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:42,720
right right there and then when it

1581
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,319
flipped above it didn't

1582
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,040
but this was another area to just

1583
01:02:47,040 --> 01:02:50,079
consider if price came back into it so i

1584
01:02:50,079 --> 01:02:51,920
had put this here

1585
01:02:51,920 --> 01:02:54,880
you know placed my

1586
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:57,680
stop loss right above this area

1587
01:02:57,680 --> 01:03:00,160
because this is such a small area that i

1588
01:03:00,160 --> 01:03:02,960
i did not expect a reaction

1589
01:03:02,960 --> 01:03:06,000
that would put in a new low

1590
01:03:06,000 --> 01:03:08,799
from right here

1591
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:10,960
so this did come here there was a

1592
01:03:10,960 --> 01:03:12,720
reaction that took us down but this

1593
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:15,680
reaction took us down into

1594
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,920
the trade

1595
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:20,720
that we were taking

1596
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:22,720
and if you wanted to minimize your stop

1597
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:24,240
loss this is because i didn't go back

1598
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:25,599
and look at it so this is the type of

1599
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:27,599
trading essay people do they set up an

1600
01:03:27,599 --> 01:03:29,760
area and then they wait for price to

1601
01:03:29,760 --> 01:03:31,280
come back into

1602
01:03:31,280 --> 01:03:32,160
but

1603
01:03:32,160 --> 01:03:34,319
if i actually wanted to minimize the

1604
01:03:34,319 --> 01:03:36,079
amount of pips

1605
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:38,240
that my stop-loss was

1606
01:03:38,240 --> 01:03:40,160
then i would begin to look into this

1607
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:41,280
area

1608
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:43,119
so i see it to where

1609
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:46,960
according to this candlestick structure

1610
01:03:46,960 --> 01:03:48,400
let me uh

1611
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:49,680
show you

1612
01:03:49,680 --> 01:03:51,119
because i feel like i could show things

1613
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:53,200
better than i could tell it and and

1614
01:03:53,200 --> 01:03:55,280
showing it would be very helpful for you

1615
01:03:55,280 --> 01:03:58,400
guys so you have this area here you have

1616
01:03:58,400 --> 01:04:00,799
this low this high

1617
01:04:00,799 --> 01:04:04,960
this low this high what do we have here

1618
01:04:04,960 --> 01:04:06,480
a break

1619
01:04:06,480 --> 01:04:08,480
of the low

1620
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:10,079
and then what do we get we don't get

1621
01:04:10,079 --> 01:04:11,760
another low

1622
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:15,359
we get a high put in high is ran

1623
01:04:15,359 --> 01:04:17,920
now this ran three of the highs

1624
01:04:17,920 --> 01:04:19,280
quick push up

1625
01:04:19,280 --> 01:04:21,680
on the second time frame that this looks

1626
01:04:21,680 --> 01:04:25,440
like trend line touches going down

1627
01:04:25,440 --> 01:04:27,200
price runs

1628
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,760
all of the trend line touches

1629
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:30,640
so

1630
01:04:30,640 --> 01:04:32,240
you have a lot of traders who trade with

1631
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,559
trend lines and

1632
01:04:34,559 --> 01:04:36,799
they don't understand that price is

1633
01:04:36,799 --> 01:04:38,880
just storing up liquidity

1634
01:04:38,880 --> 01:04:39,680
to

1635
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:42,400
come back and run it

1636
01:04:42,400 --> 01:04:44,079
and that's exactly what it did it ran it

1637
01:04:44,079 --> 01:04:45,359
now granted this is the seconds time

1638
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,160
frame so the run on this is is not

1639
01:04:48,160 --> 01:04:49,760
necessarily

1640
01:04:49,760 --> 01:04:51,680
that deep i guess this is 10 pips on

1641
01:04:51,680 --> 01:04:52,799
gold so

1642
01:04:52,799 --> 01:04:54,559
it could be depending on what your lot

1643
01:04:54,559 --> 01:04:56,000
size is but that's why you manage your

1644
01:04:56,000 --> 01:04:56,880
risk

1645
01:04:56,880 --> 01:04:58,000
we had

1646
01:04:58,000 --> 01:04:59,839
back to what we were saying

1647
01:04:59,839 --> 01:05:00,960
we had

1648
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:03,920
a run of this high so when the high is

1649
01:05:03,920 --> 01:05:04,880
ran

1650
01:05:04,880 --> 01:05:07,280
we're looking for a pullback into this

1651
01:05:07,280 --> 01:05:09,839
area mind you this is candlesticks alone

1652
01:05:09,839 --> 01:05:11,680
like we're not using large areas for

1653
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:15,039
this so you have a run back into this

1654
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:16,319
area

1655
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:19,119
so we take

1656
01:05:19,119 --> 01:05:21,520
sorry we take this here

1657
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:23,920
we place it to like like i said when you

1658
01:05:23,920 --> 01:05:25,599
go and back test it you'll see different

1659
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:27,440
areas that respond more than others this

1660
01:05:27,440 --> 01:05:31,119
might be the 50 this could be the 70 80

1661
01:05:31,119 --> 01:05:32,079
so

1662
01:05:32,079 --> 01:05:34,400
this maybe on the 80 would have been a

1663
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,400
little more precise in the tap either

1664
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:38,880
way you're looking for price to come

1665
01:05:38,880 --> 01:05:41,200
into this area here we don't know where

1666
01:05:41,200 --> 01:05:44,000
it's going to stop but then take us long

1667
01:05:44,000 --> 01:05:47,920
so our stop loss is directly behind this

1668
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,960
area here

1669
01:05:50,960 --> 01:05:54,559
and we're looking to target

1670
01:05:54,559 --> 01:05:56,799
whatever area that we believe price is

1671
01:05:56,799 --> 01:05:58,720
coming to so price already came to this

1672
01:05:58,720 --> 01:06:00,319
area here

1673
01:06:00,319 --> 01:06:03,039
we're not necessarily looking for this

1674
01:06:03,039 --> 01:06:04,480
area to

1675
01:06:04,480 --> 01:06:06,720
to be the area we trade from but what

1676
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:08,240
we're looking for

1677
01:06:08,240 --> 01:06:09,039
is

1678
01:06:09,039 --> 01:06:12,400
areas that have volume in it

1679
01:06:12,400 --> 01:06:14,880
and i could

1680
01:06:14,880 --> 01:06:17,599
you know just highlight it for you

1681
01:06:17,599 --> 01:06:20,319
there's volume in this area here

1682
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:23,440
there's volume up in this area here

1683
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,599
there's volume in this area

1684
01:06:25,599 --> 01:06:28,319
and there's

1685
01:06:29,039 --> 01:06:32,079
i would say maybe more of this area

1686
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,720
volume here

1687
01:06:35,520 --> 01:06:38,160
so we're taking our trades and em i know

1688
01:06:38,160 --> 01:06:39,920
you had um actually just earlier if

1689
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:42,319
you're still here um prior to coming on

1690
01:06:42,319 --> 01:06:43,359
the stream

1691
01:06:43,359 --> 01:06:44,559
um

1692
01:06:44,559 --> 01:06:46,640
we're take we're targeting

1693
01:06:46,640 --> 01:06:49,839
areas with volume in it

1694
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,760
so because we know there's no volume in

1695
01:06:51,760 --> 01:06:54,160
these areas what are we doing

1696
01:06:54,160 --> 01:06:55,839
we're bypassing this

1697
01:06:55,839 --> 01:06:58,160
we're looking to take this to the next

1698
01:06:58,160 --> 01:07:01,359
possible area of volume

1699
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:04,319
so if you look at this

1700
01:07:04,640 --> 01:07:06,319
this is

1701
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:08,640
a 1 to 10 10 to 1 whatever you guys want

1702
01:07:08,640 --> 01:07:10,079
to call it

1703
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,720
this is 99 cents for your stop loss

1704
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:18,319
you know nine nine nine pips

1705
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:20,480
nine pips nine pipettes you know

1706
01:07:20,480 --> 01:07:22,079
whatever you want to call it but this is

1707
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:24,319
this is 99 cents on gold i'm saying that

1708
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:27,599
it's you know it's a dollar stop loss

1709
01:07:27,599 --> 01:07:30,000
or 9 pip stop loss almost 10

1710
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:32,240
and you're taking this up to an area of

1711
01:07:32,240 --> 01:07:33,280
volume

1712
01:07:33,280 --> 01:07:35,599
you found this here

1713
01:07:35,599 --> 01:07:38,079
and you were able to minimize your risk

1714
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:41,039
when price came back into your area and

1715
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,079
you looked for the flip

1716
01:07:44,079 --> 01:07:45,839
but if you were just a trader who

1717
01:07:45,839 --> 01:07:48,400
preferred to wait

1718
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:49,280
and

1719
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:52,640
just have the order trigger you in

1720
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:55,039
you have your stops behind here and your

1721
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,480
targets is the same the volume

1722
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,240
look at the difference between these two

1723
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:01,280
trades

1724
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,319
both of them are great trades

1725
01:08:04,319 --> 01:08:09,559
one had way less risk than the other

1726
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,400
it's ten to one

1727
01:08:12,400 --> 01:08:14,559
this is four to one

1728
01:08:14,559 --> 01:08:16,560
this if your stop loss was hit you'd

1729
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:18,640
have been out in 10 pips

1730
01:08:18,640 --> 01:08:21,279
this if your stop loss was hit

1731
01:08:21,279 --> 01:08:22,839
that's 25

1732
01:08:22,839 --> 01:08:25,439
pips and remember with pips the

1733
01:08:25,439 --> 01:08:27,198
measurement of pips could mean anything

1734
01:08:27,198 --> 01:08:28,560
you know depending on the lot size

1735
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:30,640
you're trading on

1736
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,839
but

1737
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:34,880
this is the reality of waiting for price

1738
01:08:34,880 --> 01:08:38,238
to get into your area and then looking

1739
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:41,120
for an area to trade from you do not

1740
01:08:41,120 --> 01:08:42,479
need to have

1741
01:08:42,479 --> 01:08:45,359
limit orders or or buy stop orders or

1742
01:08:45,359 --> 01:08:47,439
what you you do not need to have it up

1743
01:08:47,439 --> 01:08:48,238
here

1744
01:08:48,238 --> 01:08:51,359
waiting for price to come to your area

1745
01:08:51,359 --> 01:08:52,880
here maybe

1746
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:54,880
and you place your stop directly behind

1747
01:08:54,880 --> 01:08:56,640
here and then you get

1748
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:59,600
ran out of the park

1749
01:09:01,040 --> 01:09:03,040
ran out of park and i see this happen

1750
01:09:03,040 --> 01:09:05,600
with a lot of traders on stream every

1751
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:07,920
morning my morning routine is to go and

1752
01:09:07,920 --> 01:09:09,679
check the traders who traded in london

1753
01:09:09,679 --> 01:09:10,880
session

1754
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:12,799
and every time that

1755
01:09:12,799 --> 01:09:14,479
i'm done trading

1756
01:09:14,479 --> 01:09:16,080
i go and check the traders who trade in

1757
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,920
the morning session

1758
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:19,679
and then i realize that there's

1759
01:09:19,679 --> 01:09:21,439
barely anybody to trade in the asian

1760
01:09:21,439 --> 01:09:23,198
session and i guess because the volume

1761
01:09:23,198 --> 01:09:24,880
is so slow and they're not able to

1762
01:09:24,880 --> 01:09:26,000
really like

1763
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,960
jump in with an impulsive movement

1764
01:09:28,960 --> 01:09:31,359
but the asian session follows

1765
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:34,158
you know rules that follow structure so

1766
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,679
if you get in on the asian session these

1767
01:09:35,679 --> 01:09:38,238
moves are a lot more cleaner

1768
01:09:38,238 --> 01:09:41,040
and they're shorter too in terms of like

1769
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:42,640
you know if you were getting in on an

1770
01:09:42,640 --> 01:09:44,960
area and where the stop loss would be

1771
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,520
they would be sure to stop losses

1772
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:50,238
you'd have like like 13 pip stop losses

1773
01:09:50,238 --> 01:09:52,960
sometimes 10 pip stop losses

1774
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,120
you know this one was 19 here that that

1775
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:56,480
we had mentioned but

1776
01:09:56,480 --> 01:09:58,960
you'd you'd have a bunch of stop losses

1777
01:09:58,960 --> 01:10:01,440
that are very short i'm trying to find a

1778
01:10:01,440 --> 01:10:04,000
an asian session that i might have

1779
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:05,760
traded in

1780
01:10:05,760 --> 01:10:09,199
but i don't see it

1781
01:10:10,000 --> 01:10:11,280
that's here

1782
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:12,880
look at this

1783
01:10:12,880 --> 01:10:16,400
10 pip stop loss 189 pips in the asian

1784
01:10:16,400 --> 01:10:18,800
session

1785
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:22,560
189 pips or or whatever that was yeah

1786
01:10:22,560 --> 01:10:25,600
189 pips

1787
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:28,320
in the asian session

1788
01:10:28,320 --> 01:10:30,800
the moves are a lot cleaner

1789
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:34,480
you know the volume is slower so you can

1790
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:37,199
time the market a little better

1791
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,400
with with these slower movements

1792
01:10:40,400 --> 01:10:43,120
but i had it coming up to my area

1793
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:46,719
tapped in took me out

1794
01:10:46,960 --> 01:10:48,960
it doesn't have to be rocket science we

1795
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:51,360
ran the two we ran the equal lows

1796
01:10:51,360 --> 01:10:53,280
we went into a particular area to the

1797
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:56,080
left i don't know what that area is

1798
01:10:56,080 --> 01:10:58,880
um i don't quite remember i think i

1799
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,120
actually had i had something here but i

1800
01:11:01,120 --> 01:11:03,520
i deleted it i i'll go back probably

1801
01:11:03,520 --> 01:11:05,920
later and look at it um but it was

1802
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:07,920
definitely tapping directly into this

1803
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,239
area because i had this here

1804
01:11:10,239 --> 01:11:13,520
um probably from the left and

1805
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:15,040
tapped in

1806
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,320
then what

1807
01:11:16,320 --> 01:11:18,000
what happened

1808
01:11:18,000 --> 01:11:20,000
that made us know we could possibly go

1809
01:11:20,000 --> 01:11:23,679
long from here if we wanted to

1810
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:25,199
we had the shift

1811
01:11:25,199 --> 01:11:28,159
remember candlestick structure low high

1812
01:11:28,159 --> 01:11:28,960
low

1813
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,239
run of the high

1814
01:11:30,239 --> 01:11:32,000
come back into the area it's probably

1815
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:34,560
like 80 90 percent

1816
01:11:34,560 --> 01:11:36,560
and then take us to the top side so

1817
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:39,040
that's how you can find buys in well

1818
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:42,480
sales into buys or buys into cells

1819
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,880
because you're you're placing these

1820
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:46,320
rules

1821
01:11:46,320 --> 01:11:49,840
on areas of interest for you

1822
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:53,120
this needs to happen first in order for

1823
01:11:53,120 --> 01:11:55,679
you to look for a trade not a tap into

1824
01:11:55,679 --> 01:11:57,040
the area

1825
01:11:57,040 --> 01:11:59,440
a tap into the area does not need to

1826
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,840
happen

1827
01:12:02,400 --> 01:12:04,080
you need to notice

1828
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:06,080
some type of pattern

1829
01:12:06,080 --> 01:12:08,080
taking place when it gets to your area

1830
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:09,840
to give you confidence to get in and

1831
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,320
you'll realize that you stay out of a

1832
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:15,280
lot of losing trades because of that

1833
01:12:15,280 --> 01:12:17,199
you do not end up with a bunch of losing

1834
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,199
trades when you have those rules and

1835
01:12:19,199 --> 01:12:22,239
when you follow those rules

1836
01:12:22,239 --> 01:12:24,320
like price dipped down here

1837
01:12:24,320 --> 01:12:26,560
took out this low

1838
01:12:26,560 --> 01:12:29,199
but then came above here

1839
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:31,360
it didn't run the high

1840
01:12:31,360 --> 01:12:33,520
so because it didn't run the high

1841
01:12:33,520 --> 01:12:35,280
i know that

1842
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:38,640
this is still bearish

1843
01:12:38,640 --> 01:12:41,040
if i had the high ran then

1844
01:12:41,040 --> 01:12:43,600
price would come back into this area i

1845
01:12:43,600 --> 01:12:46,480
would get out here and then take a trade

1846
01:12:46,480 --> 01:12:49,120
long from this area

1847
01:12:49,120 --> 01:12:51,840
but because i still saw that price was

1848
01:12:51,840 --> 01:12:53,440
still bearish even though i had this

1849
01:12:53,440 --> 01:12:55,600
huge push down followed by this huge

1850
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:56,880
push back up

1851
01:12:56,880 --> 01:12:58,800
it still didn't take out

1852
01:12:58,800 --> 01:13:01,199
the structural area needed to to flip

1853
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:05,840
bullish so i knew this was still bearish

1854
01:13:06,080 --> 01:13:08,400
and that's what you get and so you have

1855
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:10,239
price pushing down here

1856
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:11,760
now you see

1857
01:13:11,760 --> 01:13:14,640
the bearish flip

1858
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,520
we get one flip here and if you want to

1859
01:13:17,520 --> 01:13:19,520
play it safe you could wait for a second

1860
01:13:19,520 --> 01:13:20,719
one

1861
01:13:20,719 --> 01:13:22,320
because remember i said around areas

1862
01:13:22,320 --> 01:13:24,560
that you get in you sometimes get a a

1863
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,520
second touch of that area and then price

1864
01:13:27,520 --> 01:13:29,280
goes from that area

1865
01:13:29,280 --> 01:13:30,880
you could wait for the second touch if

1866
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:33,360
you want to if you're not feeling too

1867
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:35,600
confident about it

1868
01:13:35,600 --> 01:13:37,120
you can just wait for the second touch

1869
01:13:37,120 --> 01:13:38,480
because even here

1870
01:13:38,480 --> 01:13:41,520
price dipped

1871
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,600
no sorry it just

1872
01:13:43,600 --> 01:13:45,920
came right out flipped back up and then

1873
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:47,440
traded down of course this would have

1874
01:13:47,440 --> 01:13:48,640
been some

1875
01:13:48,640 --> 01:13:52,960
you know a scout possibly here but um

1876
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:56,159
if if i had an area here

1877
01:13:56,159 --> 01:13:58,640
you would have price shift below it

1878
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:00,719
come up touch

1879
01:14:00,719 --> 01:14:02,880
might reject the way and come back and

1880
01:14:02,880 --> 01:14:05,840
touch a second time and then finally

1881
01:14:05,840 --> 01:14:08,000
leave the area so because you have that

1882
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:11,360
sometimes you can just wait for that

1883
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:15,040
you can just be patient on that and

1884
01:14:15,040 --> 01:14:17,679
you can catch a trade from a lot of

1885
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,600
these different areas and not get

1886
01:14:19,600 --> 01:14:21,600
stopped out because you're prematurely

1887
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:25,760
placing you know um stop losses and and

1888
01:14:25,760 --> 01:14:28,159
take profits when you don't even really

1889
01:14:28,159 --> 01:14:31,040
see what price is doing

1890
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,800
you don't really have any understanding

1891
01:14:32,800 --> 01:14:35,760
of what price is doing

1892
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:39,040
so look

1893
01:14:39,040 --> 01:14:40,400
we have it

1894
01:14:40,400 --> 01:14:42,880
it came all the way back to

1895
01:14:42,880 --> 01:14:44,400
where this high was remember i said i'd

1896
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:46,480
like to see a couple candles between the

1897
01:14:46,480 --> 01:14:48,560
area before it returns

1898
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:50,320
to get an idea of

1899
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:54,000
knowing whether we we possibly have some

1900
01:14:54,000 --> 01:14:56,480
you know some bearish momentum out of

1901
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:58,800
this area

1902
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,880
and we have that so we took the first

1903
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:02,960
trade here

1904
01:15:02,960 --> 01:15:05,199
and there was sure enough a possibility

1905
01:15:05,199 --> 01:15:08,400
to take another trade here

1906
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:11,840
and why is that

1907
01:15:11,840 --> 01:15:13,360
because

1908
01:15:13,360 --> 01:15:16,080
we have these series of lows and highs

1909
01:15:16,080 --> 01:15:19,040
taking us up but then we have

1910
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:20,800
a break

1911
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:23,800
down

1912
01:15:24,159 --> 01:15:25,760
and here's one thing that i've been

1913
01:15:25,760 --> 01:15:28,080
noticing i don't want you guys to to

1914
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,400
take this entirely for for what i'm

1915
01:15:30,400 --> 01:15:32,239
saying now because i'm still

1916
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:34,080
trying to figure it out but i'm i'm

1917
01:15:34,080 --> 01:15:35,520
telling you guys because i'm very

1918
01:15:35,520 --> 01:15:37,120
transparent with my system and my

1919
01:15:37,120 --> 01:15:39,280
information and i want you guys to be

1920
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:40,880
able to look for it as well and maybe

1921
01:15:40,880 --> 01:15:42,800
you guys might find a system that's 10

1922
01:15:42,800 --> 01:15:44,239
times better than mine you know who

1923
01:15:44,239 --> 01:15:45,760
knows but

1924
01:15:45,760 --> 01:15:48,080
you can incorporate this in it because

1925
01:15:48,080 --> 01:15:50,080
if you look at this low that was taken

1926
01:15:50,080 --> 01:15:51,440
out here

1927
01:15:51,440 --> 01:15:53,520
you know this one just

1928
01:15:53,520 --> 01:15:56,239
you know took a crap coming down into

1929
01:15:56,239 --> 01:15:57,840
this area

1930
01:15:57,840 --> 01:16:00,960
you know and then push back up

1931
01:16:00,960 --> 01:16:03,199
you have two areas to trade from

1932
01:16:03,199 --> 01:16:05,120
you have this low here

1933
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:08,880
that was taken out by this move down

1934
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:09,679
you

1935
01:16:09,679 --> 01:16:12,000
you have this low this high you're

1936
01:16:12,000 --> 01:16:13,440
looking for price to come and tap back

1937
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:15,120
into the area you see we got this tap

1938
01:16:15,120 --> 01:16:18,159
here but then you also have this low

1939
01:16:18,159 --> 01:16:19,600
here

1940
01:16:19,600 --> 01:16:21,280
that this took out

1941
01:16:21,280 --> 01:16:24,080
so now you could start looking for your

1942
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,280
pullback

1943
01:16:25,280 --> 01:16:29,280
within the range of this low

1944
01:16:29,280 --> 01:16:31,760
and this high

1945
01:16:31,760 --> 01:16:34,960
because this is as far as the candle

1946
01:16:34,960 --> 01:16:36,159
went

1947
01:16:36,159 --> 01:16:39,760
when it broke structure to the downside

1948
01:16:39,760 --> 01:16:41,840
so you could you could use

1949
01:16:41,840 --> 01:16:43,920
this if you wanted to now with using

1950
01:16:43,920 --> 01:16:46,480
wicks there might be a little more fake

1951
01:16:46,480 --> 01:16:49,040
outs than using a body because if you

1952
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:52,000
use this here the body came below

1953
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:54,800
this right here

1954
01:16:55,120 --> 01:16:58,159
where is it right here

1955
01:16:58,320 --> 01:17:01,040
you see the body came below

1956
01:17:01,040 --> 01:17:02,400
and then what happened we have to pull

1957
01:17:02,400 --> 01:17:04,800
back up

1958
01:17:05,040 --> 01:17:07,840
so we we get the pull back up

1959
01:17:07,840 --> 01:17:09,840
we get an area in which we're trading

1960
01:17:09,840 --> 01:17:12,800
from we get the exact thing that i like

1961
01:17:12,800 --> 01:17:14,880
that i said i like to see i like to see

1962
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,719
a candle take out the previous high and

1963
01:17:16,719 --> 01:17:19,600
then trade back within it

1964
01:17:19,600 --> 01:17:21,199
and then we had

1965
01:17:21,199 --> 01:17:23,120
a low right here and then the next

1966
01:17:23,120 --> 01:17:25,199
candle came up take out the high and

1967
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:27,120
trade it back within it

1968
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,320
so that's still giving me some

1969
01:17:28,320 --> 01:17:31,840
indication that it's bearish from here

1970
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:34,000
and we end up

1971
01:17:34,000 --> 01:17:36,239
taking a trade out of here

1972
01:17:36,239 --> 01:17:40,400
stops directly below above here

1973
01:17:42,480 --> 01:17:44,400
and the area that we were originally

1974
01:17:44,400 --> 01:17:46,480
anticipating

1975
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:49,600
is possibly there

1976
01:17:55,920 --> 01:17:58,000
and we'd be taking it down into this

1977
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:00,320
area

1978
01:18:00,640 --> 01:18:03,120
because this is an area that we possibly

1979
01:18:03,120 --> 01:18:06,080
anticipated it coming to

1980
01:18:06,080 --> 01:18:09,280
but then we're monitoring this

1981
01:18:09,280 --> 01:18:12,719
to see is it going to give us a bullish

1982
01:18:12,719 --> 01:18:14,960
flip to the top side

1983
01:18:14,960 --> 01:18:17,280
and if it gives us a bullish flip

1984
01:18:17,280 --> 01:18:19,440
we'll wait until price comes back into

1985
01:18:19,440 --> 01:18:20,880
the area

1986
01:18:20,880 --> 01:18:22,560
and then

1987
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:24,560
we'll take it to wherever it's going

1988
01:18:24,560 --> 01:18:26,080
we'll take a buy up to wherever it's

1989
01:18:26,080 --> 01:18:27,760
going the buy can just be coming back

1990
01:18:27,760 --> 01:18:29,760
here why would it come back here look at

1991
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,120
all of this imbalance this here

1992
01:18:33,120 --> 01:18:35,920
so the areas that have imbalance

1993
01:18:35,920 --> 01:18:36,800
are

1994
01:18:36,800 --> 01:18:39,600
more likely to be areas that price taps

1995
01:18:39,600 --> 01:18:42,159
into and trades away from

1996
01:18:42,159 --> 01:18:43,840
so we could potentially

1997
01:18:43,840 --> 01:18:46,800
have a tap here

1998
01:18:46,800 --> 01:18:48,560
and then we might see some bearish

1999
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:50,719
behavior setting up

2000
01:18:50,719 --> 01:18:52,080
up here

2001
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:54,560
and then we'll end up just taking it

2002
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,480
short

2003
01:18:56,480 --> 01:18:59,040
but this is what you want to see

2004
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:00,560
this is what you this is exactly what

2005
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:03,199
you want to see

2006
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:06,320
exactly like this

2007
01:19:06,320 --> 01:19:09,840
high low high low high

2008
01:19:09,840 --> 01:19:11,360
disrupted

2009
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,159
the trend with this low

2010
01:19:14,159 --> 01:19:15,760
we're going to pull back back into this

2011
01:19:15,760 --> 01:19:16,960
area

2012
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,000
and now we pull down

2013
01:19:20,159 --> 01:19:20,840
and

2014
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:24,640
when price gets to our area that we're

2015
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:28,000
looking to possibly trade from

2016
01:19:28,000 --> 01:19:30,800
now we're just trying to figure out

2017
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:32,719
is it going to give us

2018
01:19:32,719 --> 01:19:35,120
a bullish flip

2019
01:19:35,120 --> 01:19:37,520
is price going to flip bullish

2020
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:40,800
to take us back up here

2021
01:19:40,800 --> 01:19:42,560
and you might potentially have that you

2022
01:19:42,560 --> 01:19:44,480
might have that here

2023
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:48,280
you could have that with this

2024
01:19:50,080 --> 01:19:53,040
flipped above the high

2025
01:19:54,239 --> 01:19:55,920
you could have it come back into this

2026
01:19:55,920 --> 01:19:57,679
area maybe this supply area here

2027
01:19:57,679 --> 01:20:00,239
possibly

2028
01:20:01,440 --> 01:20:04,960
and then you could have price

2029
01:20:04,960 --> 01:20:08,320
flip up just to go here

2030
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,760
tap this and now it's away again

2031
01:20:11,760 --> 01:20:13,679
or it may not even make it to here it

2032
01:20:13,679 --> 01:20:16,480
may just make it somewhere here

2033
01:20:16,480 --> 01:20:19,600
in between here

2034
01:20:19,600 --> 01:20:21,120
and then

2035
01:20:21,120 --> 01:20:22,080
take us

2036
01:20:22,080 --> 01:20:24,960
back away from this entry

2037
01:20:24,960 --> 01:20:26,480
why because you could have double

2038
01:20:26,480 --> 01:20:27,520
touches

2039
01:20:27,520 --> 01:20:31,560
in in these entries

2040
01:20:32,000 --> 01:20:33,440
you could have price

2041
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:35,280
certainly touching

2042
01:20:35,280 --> 01:20:39,520
you know an area twice before leaving

2043
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,760
and being now that i i

2044
01:20:45,760 --> 01:20:49,199
got an idea of it this is actually the

2045
01:20:49,199 --> 01:20:51,199
high sorry

2046
01:20:51,199 --> 01:20:52,960
because we're going by the the

2047
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:55,280
intermediary structure

2048
01:20:55,280 --> 01:20:56,640
and if you look

2049
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,480
uh

2050
01:20:58,480 --> 01:21:01,840
yeah if you look right here

2051
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:08,719
well this is technically not

2052
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:12,640
a high it's kind of flat there

2053
01:21:12,840 --> 01:21:16,000
um but either way we have here as the

2054
01:21:16,000 --> 01:21:18,080
last high that was created before the

2055
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,320
low

2056
01:21:23,600 --> 01:21:25,360
yeah last high that was created before

2057
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:28,520
the low

2058
01:21:28,960 --> 01:21:32,719
but i think this might have been

2059
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:36,280
let me see

2060
01:21:47,600 --> 01:21:49,920
this was a low

2061
01:21:49,920 --> 01:21:51,600
let me just double check

2062
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:57,280
this is the so the low for this is one

2063
01:21:57,280 --> 01:21:59,760
one five four

2064
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:02,239
the low for this is one five four okay

2065
01:22:02,239 --> 01:22:05,760
so this is equal lows

2066
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:10,440
so it was actually this here

2067
01:22:10,960 --> 01:22:12,960
this was it here

2068
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,800
and when i'm trading by myself most

2069
01:22:14,800 --> 01:22:18,159
times i'm noticing this in real time so

2070
01:22:18,159 --> 01:22:21,120
this is actually

2071
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:23,679
this is the last high before these equal

2072
01:22:23,679 --> 01:22:25,280
lows were put in

2073
01:22:25,280 --> 01:22:29,199
and then price ran it so after price ran

2074
01:22:29,199 --> 01:22:32,080
this high here

2075
01:22:32,159 --> 01:22:34,880
with that wick

2076
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:39,080
this candle opened up

2077
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:44,000
traded to our area

2078
01:22:44,000 --> 01:22:46,080
what's our area

2079
01:22:46,080 --> 01:22:47,920
our area is

2080
01:22:47,920 --> 01:22:50,880
this here from this high

2081
01:22:50,880 --> 01:22:53,120
to the low that was put in

2082
01:22:53,120 --> 01:22:56,080
that led to the high being ran

2083
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:58,719
so we come back into this area

2084
01:22:58,719 --> 01:23:01,040
here

2085
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,800
and this is

2086
01:23:04,800 --> 01:23:07,600
where our entry is

2087
01:23:07,600 --> 01:23:08,960
right here

2088
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:12,000
stops behind here

2089
01:23:12,000 --> 01:23:14,239
and

2090
01:23:14,320 --> 01:23:17,600
we're going long possibly to this area

2091
01:23:17,600 --> 01:23:19,600
or or wherever we said it might go i

2092
01:23:19,600 --> 01:23:22,080
think we have mentioned that

2093
01:23:22,080 --> 01:23:24,400
it could potentially go

2094
01:23:24,400 --> 01:23:26,000
yeah

2095
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:27,440
here

2096
01:23:27,440 --> 01:23:30,159
but if you notice this in real time

2097
01:23:30,159 --> 01:23:33,440
look at look at how effective your your

2098
01:23:33,440 --> 01:23:36,000
trades are and if you are losing

2099
01:23:36,000 --> 01:23:38,320
look at what you're losing

2100
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,120
you're losing 13 pips

2101
01:23:41,120 --> 01:23:43,360
on on just utilizing candlestick

2102
01:23:43,360 --> 01:23:47,880
structure and using that to scalp

2103
01:23:48,239 --> 01:23:50,320
and if you want to take longer moves if

2104
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:51,760
you want to take moves that you don't

2105
01:23:51,760 --> 01:23:53,760
have to pay attention to

2106
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,600
do it on the 5 minute do it on the 15

2107
01:23:55,600 --> 01:23:57,040
minute

2108
01:23:57,040 --> 01:23:58,480
those take anywhere from

2109
01:23:58,480 --> 01:23:59,760
[Music]

2110
01:23:59,760 --> 01:24:03,040
you know like 12 hours to

2111
01:24:03,040 --> 01:24:06,800
36 or 48 hours to play out

2112
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:09,040
so but go because those take longer you

2113
01:24:09,040 --> 01:24:10,639
may not have to look at the chart as

2114
01:24:10,639 --> 01:24:12,639
much and notice things as fast because

2115
01:24:12,639 --> 01:24:14,880
they take longer to to play out and you

2116
01:24:14,880 --> 01:24:17,840
would just look at each candle closure

2117
01:24:17,840 --> 01:24:19,760
to give you the same story that these

2118
01:24:19,760 --> 01:24:23,120
smaller candles are giving you

2119
01:24:24,960 --> 01:24:28,159
so we get that we get this flip above

2120
01:24:28,159 --> 01:24:30,159
here because remember we said that that

2121
01:24:30,159 --> 01:24:32,320
was

2122
01:24:32,320 --> 01:24:34,639
this was a previous high too

2123
01:24:34,639 --> 01:24:36,960
but then we also get a flip above

2124
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,120
this high

2125
01:24:39,120 --> 01:24:41,360
here

2126
01:24:42,159 --> 01:24:45,280
so what do we possibly have

2127
01:24:45,280 --> 01:24:48,159
we might have

2128
01:24:52,320 --> 01:24:54,960
a play back into

2129
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:57,199
here

2130
01:24:57,199 --> 01:24:59,199
back into this area and then a

2131
01:24:59,199 --> 01:25:01,920
continuation above

2132
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:04,639
but again what are we looking at

2133
01:25:04,639 --> 01:25:06,560
what is the overall objective of

2134
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:08,320
noticing this

2135
01:25:08,320 --> 01:25:11,120
we're looking to see

2136
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:14,480
if price is going to

2137
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:16,719
take us here

2138
01:25:16,719 --> 01:25:18,480
and show us some bearish behavior to

2139
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,040
continue down

2140
01:25:21,040 --> 01:25:22,159
or

2141
01:25:22,159 --> 01:25:24,639
price pulls back in here

2142
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:25,679
and then

2143
01:25:25,679 --> 01:25:28,400
run the high

2144
01:25:29,199 --> 01:25:31,120
and a lot of the times

2145
01:25:31,120 --> 01:25:34,960
we could have a pull back into this area

2146
01:25:34,960 --> 01:25:37,440
and once price pull pulls back into this

2147
01:25:37,440 --> 01:25:38,960
area

2148
01:25:38,960 --> 01:25:42,159
we end up pushing a lot higher because

2149
01:25:42,159 --> 01:25:44,719
as i mentioned this v-shaped pattern

2150
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:47,280
that price usually makes

2151
01:25:47,280 --> 01:25:50,880
is a reversal pattern

2152
01:25:51,120 --> 01:25:53,840
it means that price is reversing from a

2153
01:25:53,840 --> 01:25:56,960
particular area

2154
01:25:56,960 --> 01:25:59,520
and that's only if the v shape is

2155
01:25:59,520 --> 01:26:00,960
completed

2156
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,080
with the different structural elements

2157
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:07,960
that are taken into account

2158
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:11,040
so

2159
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:14,080
we're watching this and observing this

2160
01:26:14,080 --> 01:26:15,440
but again

2161
01:26:15,440 --> 01:26:18,080
we had an entry down here

2162
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,520
which was a part of candlestick

2163
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:20,800
structure

2164
01:26:20,800 --> 01:26:23,360
there's a possible entry here

2165
01:26:23,360 --> 01:26:25,360
which is a part of

2166
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,520
secondary structure

2167
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:28,320
and

2168
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:30,639
if we have a run

2169
01:26:30,639 --> 01:26:32,800
of these highs

2170
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:34,880
or a run of this high let's say it runs

2171
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:38,400
this high but doesn't take out this high

2172
01:26:38,400 --> 01:26:41,199
we might have a run back into this area

2173
01:26:41,199 --> 01:26:45,199
because the v shape was completed

2174
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,520
and then we get a touch in this area and

2175
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:49,679
we go long

2176
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:52,800
but that's just us creating a narrative

2177
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,880
or a story for what price can do

2178
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:59,840
and if

2179
01:27:00,159 --> 01:27:02,080
it starts to play out with those rules

2180
01:27:02,080 --> 01:27:04,239
that we set

2181
01:27:04,239 --> 01:27:06,000
then fine

2182
01:27:06,000 --> 01:27:07,440
you know like though those are the

2183
01:27:07,440 --> 01:27:09,360
trades that that we will look to get

2184
01:27:09,360 --> 01:27:10,800
involved with those are the trades that

2185
01:27:10,800 --> 01:27:13,679
will look to take

2186
01:27:14,239 --> 01:27:17,440
you know and usually with areas that

2187
01:27:17,440 --> 01:27:19,520
that i often see

2188
01:27:19,520 --> 01:27:20,719
you know price

2189
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:23,679
may have a reaction from or even run

2190
01:27:23,679 --> 01:27:25,360
you get it to where i mean we we

2191
01:27:25,360 --> 01:27:27,920
explained it earlier that sometimes

2192
01:27:27,920 --> 01:27:30,960
price would come close to an area and

2193
01:27:30,960 --> 01:27:33,600
then reject away from it

2194
01:27:33,600 --> 01:27:36,320
just like this

2195
01:27:36,400 --> 01:27:39,199
it came close to this area

2196
01:27:39,199 --> 01:27:42,080
then gave us a pullback after

2197
01:27:42,080 --> 01:27:44,239
so people looking to try and get in from

2198
01:27:44,239 --> 01:27:48,639
here to maybe run this high here

2199
01:27:48,639 --> 01:27:51,120
they got in here trying to run this

2200
01:27:51,120 --> 01:27:55,199
quick high but then got pulled back

2201
01:27:55,199 --> 01:27:57,120
so anytime price is getting near a

2202
01:27:57,120 --> 01:27:59,520
particular area and you don't know what

2203
01:27:59,520 --> 01:28:01,440
structure is doing

2204
01:28:01,440 --> 01:28:04,080
you don't chase these little movements

2205
01:28:04,080 --> 01:28:05,679
don't chase these little hives you don't

2206
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:08,239
have to because you're gonna have so

2207
01:28:08,239 --> 01:28:10,960
many setups present themselves

2208
01:28:10,960 --> 01:28:13,600
so many setups within this

2209
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:15,600
this is just between

2210
01:28:15,600 --> 01:28:18,320
10 and 12

2211
01:28:18,960 --> 01:28:21,360
that that these setups took place

2212
01:28:21,360 --> 01:28:25,280
between 10 o'clock and 12 o'clock

2213
01:28:26,639 --> 01:28:30,080
you know so so when you have

2214
01:28:30,080 --> 01:28:32,480
actually let me see

2215
01:28:32,480 --> 01:28:34,320
yeah no

2216
01:28:34,320 --> 01:28:36,239
so so when you have

2217
01:28:36,239 --> 01:28:38,960
things like this play out

2218
01:28:38,960 --> 01:28:40,960
you know you can create some confidence

2219
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:43,440
in your trading to say hey yeah i could

2220
01:28:43,440 --> 01:28:45,440
definitely stay in the trade

2221
01:28:45,440 --> 01:28:47,360
i could definitely you know like

2222
01:28:47,360 --> 01:28:49,360
continue to take it further down because

2223
01:28:49,360 --> 01:28:51,840
from from what i've what i'm seeing

2224
01:28:51,840 --> 01:28:54,000
with price action

2225
01:28:54,000 --> 01:28:55,760
i'm not seeing anything that's showing

2226
01:28:55,760 --> 01:28:56,719
me

2227
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:58,480
that price wants to

2228
01:28:58,480 --> 01:29:01,440
go bullish or go bearish

2229
01:29:01,440 --> 01:29:04,239
so because i'm not seeing that

2230
01:29:04,239 --> 01:29:06,400
you know i'm gonna continue in

2231
01:29:06,400 --> 01:29:08,880
to the area that i chose to get in and

2232
01:29:08,880 --> 01:29:10,880
i'm going to continue trading that area

2233
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:14,000
now if you were to miss this area

2234
01:29:14,000 --> 01:29:16,239
there are other areas that you can trade

2235
01:29:16,239 --> 01:29:19,360
from price often retraces as it's going

2236
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,280
down it's retracing

2237
01:29:21,280 --> 01:29:22,800
and heading down

2238
01:29:22,800 --> 01:29:25,920
so there's other high probability areas

2239
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:26,800
that

2240
01:29:26,800 --> 01:29:30,159
price can go and touch before continuing

2241
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:32,000
and a lot of the times it's areas that

2242
01:29:32,000 --> 01:29:34,159
have the imbalance

2243
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:37,440
have the unmitigated supply area

2244
01:29:37,440 --> 01:29:39,199
and

2245
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:41,040
you know you might have it to where

2246
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:41,920
price

2247
01:29:41,920 --> 01:29:46,080
is not ready to come above these highs

2248
01:29:46,159 --> 01:29:49,360
so you might even get price shifting all

2249
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:51,440
the way up here and it could put in a

2250
01:29:51,440 --> 01:29:53,600
third high for you

2251
01:29:53,600 --> 01:29:55,679
it's not a high or high but it could put

2252
01:29:55,679 --> 01:29:57,360
in a third high for you somewhere in

2253
01:29:57,360 --> 01:29:59,440
this area

2254
01:29:59,440 --> 01:30:02,960
and then continue to trade away

2255
01:30:02,960 --> 01:30:04,400
but these are these are things that you

2256
01:30:04,400 --> 01:30:06,800
just want to look for when

2257
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,960
when you have this setup

2258
01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,560
you know or when you're when you're

2259
01:30:10,560 --> 01:30:12,480
using these techniques

2260
01:30:12,480 --> 01:30:15,199
to actually trade from

2261
01:30:15,199 --> 01:30:16,880
these things that you you want to

2262
01:30:16,880 --> 01:30:18,080
consider

2263
01:30:18,080 --> 01:30:19,040
to

2264
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:21,440
either get in a trade

2265
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:24,639
or stay in a trade

2266
01:30:25,199 --> 01:30:26,320
you know like

2267
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:31,320
it's it's it's very very good to use

2268
01:30:42,080 --> 01:30:44,159
and and this area here remember what i

2269
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:45,760
talked to you guys about in terms of

2270
01:30:45,760 --> 01:30:47,760
like

2271
01:30:47,760 --> 01:30:49,040
you know

2272
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,120
what people use

2273
01:30:51,120 --> 01:30:53,280
to say whether they're going

2274
01:30:53,280 --> 01:30:55,760
short or long from an area now granted

2275
01:30:55,760 --> 01:30:57,840
they use this on like the 30 minute time

2276
01:30:57,840 --> 01:31:00,320
frame not necessarily the one minute but

2277
01:31:00,320 --> 01:31:03,199
they use this to judge whether

2278
01:31:03,199 --> 01:31:05,840
price is going to

2279
01:31:05,840 --> 01:31:07,840
you know either give them a sell coming

2280
01:31:07,840 --> 01:31:09,120
out of there

2281
01:31:09,120 --> 01:31:10,400
or

2282
01:31:10,400 --> 01:31:11,600
give them a

2283
01:31:11,600 --> 01:31:14,159
buy to go up so they'll wait for price

2284
01:31:14,159 --> 01:31:17,040
to go above the area tap back into it

2285
01:31:17,040 --> 01:31:19,440
and then take you long

2286
01:31:19,440 --> 01:31:22,239
or they'll wait for price to reject

2287
01:31:22,239 --> 01:31:23,199
twice

2288
01:31:23,199 --> 01:31:24,639
from this area

2289
01:31:24,639 --> 01:31:27,679
and then take it short

2290
01:31:28,239 --> 01:31:30,719
so there are many different

2291
01:31:30,719 --> 01:31:33,120
systems and formulas that they have and

2292
01:31:33,120 --> 01:31:34,560
that they create

2293
01:31:34,560 --> 01:31:36,080
for

2294
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:37,520
you know

2295
01:31:37,520 --> 01:31:39,840
how they're going to

2296
01:31:39,840 --> 01:31:41,360
um

2297
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:42,639
essentially

2298
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:45,760
utilize the the price action and and

2299
01:31:45,760 --> 01:31:47,040
what they're going to get into their

2300
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,960
trades with and you see look you got one

2301
01:31:48,960 --> 01:31:51,360
rejection two rejection three rejection

2302
01:31:51,360 --> 01:31:54,159
going in for a cell taking you out

2303
01:31:54,159 --> 01:31:57,800
bringing you up here

2304
01:31:58,000 --> 01:32:00,159
but you said that well they mentioned

2305
01:32:00,159 --> 01:32:02,400
that if there was a closure below this

2306
01:32:02,400 --> 01:32:04,400
area

2307
01:32:04,400 --> 01:32:06,159
you have price rejecting and closing

2308
01:32:06,159 --> 01:32:07,600
below this area

2309
01:32:07,600 --> 01:32:09,760
then it's definitely a cell coming out

2310
01:32:09,760 --> 01:32:13,199
of it stops directly behind the area

2311
01:32:13,199 --> 01:32:17,280
all right let's go gang let's go chat

2312
01:32:17,840 --> 01:32:19,600
and take it down and then it whips them

2313
01:32:19,600 --> 01:32:20,719
back up

2314
01:32:20,719 --> 01:32:23,280
why because we are absent of structure

2315
01:32:23,280 --> 01:32:25,840
we do not know what structure is doing

2316
01:32:25,840 --> 01:32:28,719
right now so if we're not aware of what

2317
01:32:28,719 --> 01:32:30,800
structure is doing

2318
01:32:30,800 --> 01:32:33,280
then we should not be just randomly

2319
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,320
taking

2320
01:32:34,320 --> 01:32:36,560
these these things and placing them on

2321
01:32:36,560 --> 01:32:37,520
here

2322
01:32:37,520 --> 01:32:39,280
like look they go just like this oh it

2323
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:40,719
used to be support

2324
01:32:40,719 --> 01:32:42,560
resistance support now a little more

2325
01:32:42,560 --> 01:32:46,480
resistance oh now we got the brake above

2326
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:49,520
so then they see the sorry they they see

2327
01:32:49,520 --> 01:32:51,440
the brake above the area

2328
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:52,880
here

2329
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:55,040
and then go like this

2330
01:32:55,040 --> 01:32:58,719
all right price comes there

2331
01:32:58,800 --> 01:33:00,880
it comes back and tests the area and

2332
01:33:00,880 --> 01:33:03,199
gets rejected

2333
01:33:03,199 --> 01:33:05,840
we're going to take it long

2334
01:33:05,840 --> 01:33:07,280
just like that

2335
01:33:07,280 --> 01:33:09,120
and i'm not saying that

2336
01:33:09,120 --> 01:33:11,840
that this can't happen

2337
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,760
because yes

2338
01:33:13,760 --> 01:33:16,719
this can this can very well happen yes

2339
01:33:16,719 --> 01:33:18,400
absolutely right

2340
01:33:18,400 --> 01:33:21,800
this can happen

2341
01:33:22,080 --> 01:33:23,280
but

2342
01:33:23,280 --> 01:33:25,520
if

2343
01:33:26,159 --> 01:33:28,320
you're just doing this everywhere across

2344
01:33:28,320 --> 01:33:31,360
the map and there's no like real

2345
01:33:31,360 --> 01:33:33,280
structure for you

2346
01:33:33,280 --> 01:33:35,440
then you end up getting stopped out most

2347
01:33:35,440 --> 01:33:37,360
times

2348
01:33:37,360 --> 01:33:38,639
you end up getting into where they're

2349
01:33:38,639 --> 01:33:40,880
like oh you know yeah that was a fake

2350
01:33:40,880 --> 01:33:43,440
out price pushed above but ended up

2351
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:46,639
coming all the way back down below

2352
01:33:46,639 --> 01:33:49,199
oh yeah chad we got hit with a fake out

2353
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:51,199
you know they they go like they do that

2354
01:33:51,199 --> 01:33:52,320
exactly

2355
01:33:52,320 --> 01:33:54,960
we got hit with a fake out

2356
01:33:54,960 --> 01:33:56,560
because they're not paying attention to

2357
01:33:56,560 --> 01:33:59,440
the actual price action of things

2358
01:33:59,440 --> 01:34:01,760
they're paying attention to

2359
01:34:01,760 --> 01:34:04,080
this little support turn resistance turn

2360
01:34:04,080 --> 01:34:05,679
support and there are people who are

2361
01:34:05,679 --> 01:34:07,520
profitable with it but if you're going

2362
01:34:07,520 --> 01:34:08,800
to use that

2363
01:34:08,800 --> 01:34:11,520
use it with structure

2364
01:34:11,520 --> 01:34:14,560
use it with structure

2365
01:34:14,800 --> 01:34:17,120
so we we had saw this trade here and

2366
01:34:17,120 --> 01:34:20,320
remember what i said i said if you see a

2367
01:34:20,320 --> 01:34:22,000
bullish flip

2368
01:34:22,000 --> 01:34:24,960
if you see any type of bullish behavior

2369
01:34:24,960 --> 01:34:26,400
that's happening

2370
01:34:26,400 --> 01:34:29,760
down in this area

2371
01:34:29,760 --> 01:34:32,640
then now you're looking to

2372
01:34:32,640 --> 01:34:34,080
[Music]

2373
01:34:34,080 --> 01:34:36,800
take price

2374
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,440
long

2375
01:34:39,440 --> 01:34:41,840
so we we were discussing this

2376
01:34:41,840 --> 01:34:42,960
and

2377
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,239
you know we kind of had it to where

2378
01:34:46,239 --> 01:34:47,760
you know we missed this one because he

2379
01:34:47,760 --> 01:34:49,440
was looking at something over here and

2380
01:34:49,440 --> 01:34:51,760
then we saw this area price never came

2381
01:34:51,760 --> 01:34:53,840
to this area but if you were in this

2382
01:34:53,840 --> 01:34:54,800
trade

2383
01:34:54,800 --> 01:34:57,199
and you noticed that we had this

2384
01:34:57,199 --> 01:34:59,600
pullback we noticed that this pullback

2385
01:34:59,600 --> 01:35:01,280
was present

2386
01:35:01,280 --> 01:35:05,520
before this high was even taken

2387
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:07,840
so

2388
01:35:07,840 --> 01:35:10,080
your area to get out

2389
01:35:10,080 --> 01:35:12,400
here

2390
01:35:12,560 --> 01:35:13,760
is

2391
01:35:13,760 --> 01:35:17,120
on the pullback of this

2392
01:35:17,120 --> 01:35:20,400
and your area to get into a buy

2393
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:23,360
is where you're selling out

2394
01:35:23,360 --> 01:35:25,360
now of course it wouldn't have been here

2395
01:35:25,360 --> 01:35:27,199
it would have more so been over here

2396
01:35:27,199 --> 01:35:29,440
after all of this price action happened

2397
01:35:29,440 --> 01:35:32,960
but you're selling out here

2398
01:35:33,600 --> 01:35:36,080
so now that you've sold out and you

2399
01:35:36,080 --> 01:35:37,600
bought in

2400
01:35:37,600 --> 01:35:39,920
remember we said we want bearish

2401
01:35:39,920 --> 01:35:42,719
behavior to take place here if bearish

2402
01:35:42,719 --> 01:35:44,880
behavior doesn't start to take place in

2403
01:35:44,880 --> 01:35:48,080
this area we're looking to take this

2404
01:35:48,080 --> 01:35:50,560
further and i said it could potentially

2405
01:35:50,560 --> 01:35:52,159
run the highs

2406
01:35:52,159 --> 01:35:56,639
so we have the highs being ran

2407
01:35:56,639 --> 01:35:58,080
and

2408
01:35:58,080 --> 01:36:00,960
no bearish behavior took place

2409
01:36:00,960 --> 01:36:06,280
for us to even consider getting out

2410
01:36:10,239 --> 01:36:12,719
yeah to even consider usb uh us getting

2411
01:36:12,719 --> 01:36:14,960
out

2412
01:36:15,920 --> 01:36:17,520
so what did i say you might have this

2413
01:36:17,520 --> 01:36:20,080
high ran

2414
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:22,560
and then you might have a pull back into

2415
01:36:22,560 --> 01:36:26,719
the area after this high is ran

2416
01:36:26,719 --> 01:36:28,400
before running this

2417
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,080
but this could just wake up and run it

2418
01:36:30,080 --> 01:36:32,719
and then fall

2419
01:36:35,199 --> 01:36:38,000
but we're we're watching price to see

2420
01:36:38,000 --> 01:36:39,840
how to manage our trade we would have

2421
01:36:39,840 --> 01:36:41,840
already been out of this we saw a

2422
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:43,679
bullish flip here there's no reason why

2423
01:36:43,679 --> 01:36:44,960
you're staying in this if you see the

2424
01:36:44,960 --> 01:36:47,280
bullish flip you get out when it flips

2425
01:36:47,280 --> 01:36:49,679
bullish you get out on the retracement

2426
01:36:49,679 --> 01:36:52,960
of it when it retraces here that's where

2427
01:36:52,960 --> 01:36:54,880
you get out but that's also where you

2428
01:36:54,880 --> 01:36:57,360
get in and take it long

2429
01:36:57,360 --> 01:37:00,719
but you're not playing like that

2430
01:37:00,719 --> 01:37:04,239
unless you actually know the signs of a

2431
01:37:04,239 --> 01:37:06,800
retracement and

2432
01:37:06,800 --> 01:37:09,280
for me the safest way to to understand

2433
01:37:09,280 --> 01:37:11,440
that or to to learn that is with

2434
01:37:11,440 --> 01:37:13,440
candlestick structure the first thing

2435
01:37:13,440 --> 01:37:15,360
i'm going to do is see the retracement

2436
01:37:15,360 --> 01:37:17,280
on candlestick structure the second

2437
01:37:17,280 --> 01:37:19,760
thing i'm going to do is confirm with

2438
01:37:19,760 --> 01:37:21,520
secondary structure

2439
01:37:21,520 --> 01:37:23,760
if it's actually happening so we had a

2440
01:37:23,760 --> 01:37:25,520
small bullish break that's probably on a

2441
01:37:25,520 --> 01:37:27,840
secondary time like a seconds time frame

2442
01:37:27,840 --> 01:37:30,800
then we had a bullish break again on the

2443
01:37:30,800 --> 01:37:32,800
secondary structure

2444
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:34,719
lower time frame flip

2445
01:37:34,719 --> 01:37:37,360
secondary structure flip on our time

2446
01:37:37,360 --> 01:37:39,600
frame that we're trading on

2447
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:41,760
pull back we didn't get the pullback

2448
01:37:41,760 --> 01:37:44,000
exactly into the area that we were

2449
01:37:44,000 --> 01:37:45,360
looking for

2450
01:37:45,360 --> 01:37:46,880
but

2451
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:50,880
we had an indication to get out

2452
01:37:52,080 --> 01:37:54,400
and we had two signs candlestick

2453
01:37:54,400 --> 01:37:56,960
structure and we had

2454
01:37:56,960 --> 01:37:59,520
secondary or intermediary structure on

2455
01:37:59,520 --> 01:38:01,040
our time frame

2456
01:38:01,040 --> 01:38:04,000
two flips on two different time frames

2457
01:38:04,000 --> 01:38:06,239
letting us know that price is is

2458
01:38:06,239 --> 01:38:11,199
confirming again that it's going bullish

2459
01:38:11,199 --> 01:38:13,440
so we got two confirmations and that was

2460
01:38:13,440 --> 01:38:16,639
two ways to get it

2461
01:38:16,639 --> 01:38:17,679
just like you might have two

2462
01:38:17,679 --> 01:38:19,440
confirmations of

2463
01:38:19,440 --> 01:38:21,199
the um

2464
01:38:21,199 --> 01:38:23,119
the flip here

2465
01:38:23,119 --> 01:38:25,520
tap into the area but then saw the flip

2466
01:38:25,520 --> 01:38:27,040
and that's your second confirmation and

2467
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:28,560
you take it long

2468
01:38:28,560 --> 01:38:31,360
just like you have that

2469
01:38:31,360 --> 01:38:33,119
you also have

2470
01:38:33,119 --> 01:38:35,440
other confirmations that you could use

2471
01:38:35,440 --> 01:38:37,280
bullish flip on a lower time flame

2472
01:38:37,280 --> 01:38:38,639
bullish flip on the time frame you're

2473
01:38:38,639 --> 01:38:40,400
trading on

2474
01:38:40,400 --> 01:38:42,719
and we're taking it long

2475
01:38:42,719 --> 01:38:45,600
and where are we taking it possibly to

2476
01:38:45,600 --> 01:38:48,800
our targets here

2477
01:38:48,960 --> 01:38:50,639
but we know that price isn't going to go

2478
01:38:50,639 --> 01:38:53,360
straight there

2479
01:38:53,440 --> 01:38:55,280
so what are we looking for

2480
01:38:55,280 --> 01:38:56,800
if we know price isn't going to go

2481
01:38:56,800 --> 01:38:58,960
straight there

2482
01:38:58,960 --> 01:39:01,360
we said that we wanted the highs to be

2483
01:39:01,360 --> 01:39:03,040
ran first

2484
01:39:03,040 --> 01:39:04,800
and when the highs are ran

2485
01:39:04,800 --> 01:39:06,639
we might have a bearish pull back into

2486
01:39:06,639 --> 01:39:08,719
the area

2487
01:39:08,719 --> 01:39:10,639
and you could have a pull back into the

2488
01:39:10,639 --> 01:39:11,520
area

2489
01:39:11,520 --> 01:39:13,040
before

2490
01:39:13,040 --> 01:39:14,880
it going long

2491
01:39:14,880 --> 01:39:18,639
but you also want to pay attention to

2492
01:39:18,639 --> 01:39:20,639
these areas

2493
01:39:20,639 --> 01:39:22,960
these why are these areas important

2494
01:39:22,960 --> 01:39:24,239
areas

2495
01:39:24,239 --> 01:39:26,880
because according to intermediary

2496
01:39:26,880 --> 01:39:29,360
structure

2497
01:39:29,760 --> 01:39:31,679
you have

2498
01:39:31,679 --> 01:39:33,920
the low you have the high

2499
01:39:33,920 --> 01:39:35,520
you have the low created you have

2500
01:39:35,520 --> 01:39:38,800
another high being put in

2501
01:39:38,960 --> 01:39:42,080
so this is an important low for us

2502
01:39:42,080 --> 01:39:45,040
now according to candlestick structure

2503
01:39:45,040 --> 01:39:48,239
this breaks a lot faster

2504
01:39:48,239 --> 01:39:48,590
than

2505
01:39:48,590 --> 01:39:49,840
[Music]

2506
01:39:49,840 --> 01:39:51,679
than uh

2507
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:52,800
you know the

2508
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:54,480
the secondary structure

2509
01:39:54,480 --> 01:39:58,320
this breaks a lot faster

2510
01:40:00,880 --> 01:40:03,280
a lot faster

2511
01:40:03,280 --> 01:40:04,800
so this isn't

2512
01:40:04,800 --> 01:40:07,119
technically a low here

2513
01:40:07,119 --> 01:40:09,280
because this wasn't a high this was an

2514
01:40:09,280 --> 01:40:11,040
equal high

2515
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:13,119
so because this was an equal high this

2516
01:40:13,119 --> 01:40:17,520
never gave us a high and then a low

2517
01:40:17,520 --> 01:40:20,000
so this gave us the same high

2518
01:40:20,000 --> 01:40:23,280
gave us a low here

2519
01:40:23,280 --> 01:40:25,520
no actually this this doesn't count as a

2520
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:27,600
low this validates

2521
01:40:27,600 --> 01:40:29,679
as the low this right here to the

2522
01:40:29,679 --> 01:40:31,840
downside so in terms of candlestick

2523
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:34,320
structure

2524
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:37,840
this is the low

2525
01:40:38,400 --> 01:40:42,480
that this gave us when it broke above

2526
01:40:44,719 --> 01:40:46,480
and then

2527
01:40:46,480 --> 01:40:49,199
now you have a break above to here

2528
01:40:49,199 --> 01:40:50,480
this becomes

2529
01:40:50,480 --> 01:40:52,000
the important low

2530
01:40:52,000 --> 01:40:54,560
so as you keep seeing price break to the

2531
01:40:54,560 --> 01:40:55,760
top side

2532
01:40:55,760 --> 01:40:57,440
you want to make sure

2533
01:40:57,440 --> 01:41:00,560
that you're spotting areas or updating

2534
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:03,119
those areas as your protected lows

2535
01:41:03,119 --> 01:41:05,119
protected lows is is

2536
01:41:05,119 --> 01:41:06,719
the area where

2537
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:08,880
smart money where the banks are trading

2538
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,000
from

2539
01:41:10,000 --> 01:41:12,880
so you get a protected low here

2540
01:41:12,880 --> 01:41:15,199
right here

2541
01:41:15,199 --> 01:41:17,360
and now you have this high

2542
01:41:17,360 --> 01:41:18,639
and you know

2543
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:21,840
if we tap into this area come back below

2544
01:41:21,840 --> 01:41:23,840
take out this low we might have a

2545
01:41:23,840 --> 01:41:26,560
retracement back into this area and then

2546
01:41:26,560 --> 01:41:30,400
trading away from the area

2547
01:41:30,400 --> 01:41:32,000
and where could be we be possibly

2548
01:41:32,000 --> 01:41:34,719
trading to unmitigated areas but when

2549
01:41:34,719 --> 01:41:37,119
you get to these areas you want to make

2550
01:41:37,119 --> 01:41:38,000
sure

2551
01:41:38,000 --> 01:41:41,440
that you're noticing the bullish flip

2552
01:41:41,440 --> 01:41:43,840
in this area because if it happens in

2553
01:41:43,840 --> 01:41:47,040
this area then you know that

2554
01:41:47,040 --> 01:41:48,480
you can take it

2555
01:41:48,480 --> 01:41:50,719
further you can take it long you may not

2556
01:41:50,719 --> 01:41:52,719
be able to take it to the high

2557
01:41:52,719 --> 01:41:54,320
you may be able to take it to another

2558
01:41:54,320 --> 01:41:56,639
area that's that's possibly somewhere

2559
01:41:56,639 --> 01:41:57,840
here

2560
01:41:57,840 --> 01:41:59,440
that price may get rejected from and

2561
01:41:59,440 --> 01:42:00,560
then go

2562
01:42:00,560 --> 01:42:02,159
but you want to see the bearish behavior

2563
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:04,400
happen on the top side first

2564
01:42:04,400 --> 01:42:06,719
and then you know all right i'm getting

2565
01:42:06,719 --> 01:42:07,760
out

2566
01:42:07,760 --> 01:42:10,960
and i'm going short

2567
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:14,159
you know so there you go you you have a

2568
01:42:14,159 --> 01:42:17,440
tap into this area

2569
01:42:17,440 --> 01:42:19,040
where we we

2570
01:42:19,040 --> 01:42:21,520
talked about this entire thing we we

2571
01:42:21,520 --> 01:42:24,320
talked it all the way through

2572
01:42:24,320 --> 01:42:25,119
with

2573
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:27,520
the reasons as to why

2574
01:42:27,520 --> 01:42:30,800
we got into any of these trades or why

2575
01:42:30,800 --> 01:42:32,800
we would have gotten to any of these

2576
01:42:32,800 --> 01:42:34,239
trades

2577
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:35,520
and

2578
01:42:35,520 --> 01:42:39,119
you would be able to be profitable

2579
01:42:39,199 --> 01:42:42,960
because your timing its patience

2580
01:42:42,960 --> 01:42:47,679
it's patience because it pays

2581
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:50,719
and the part that they

2582
01:42:50,719 --> 01:42:53,760
don't really tell you about is the

2583
01:42:53,760 --> 01:42:57,440
is the deafening silence the fear of it

2584
01:42:57,440 --> 01:43:00,159
possibly not getting to the area that

2585
01:43:00,159 --> 01:43:02,480
you want it to go

2586
01:43:02,480 --> 01:43:04,639
the fear of what if it goes back towards

2587
01:43:04,639 --> 01:43:07,360
my stop-loss the fear of i just lost

2588
01:43:07,360 --> 01:43:09,440
four days in a row

2589
01:43:09,440 --> 01:43:11,679
now i might lose five let me just sit

2590
01:43:11,679 --> 01:43:13,280
out

2591
01:43:13,280 --> 01:43:16,000
and that's what messes us up with

2592
01:43:16,000 --> 01:43:17,520
with trading

2593
01:43:17,520 --> 01:43:18,719
this way

2594
01:43:18,719 --> 01:43:21,920
that's what ruins our mindset

2595
01:43:21,920 --> 01:43:23,440
when it comes to approaching the market

2596
01:43:23,440 --> 01:43:24,800
and then we come in here and we don't

2597
01:43:24,800 --> 01:43:27,199
actually see certain setups that we can

2598
01:43:27,199 --> 01:43:28,000
take

2599
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,199
because our mind is just somewhere else

2600
01:43:31,199 --> 01:43:33,360
but now whether i'm in a good mindset

2601
01:43:33,360 --> 01:43:34,880
whether i'm in a bad mindset because

2602
01:43:34,880 --> 01:43:36,400
i've learned this so much and because

2603
01:43:36,400 --> 01:43:39,920
it's so burned into my brain

2604
01:43:39,920 --> 01:43:41,920
now i know

2605
01:43:41,920 --> 01:43:44,320
that even when i wake up from my sleep i

2606
01:43:44,320 --> 01:43:45,920
could immediately come into the market

2607
01:43:45,920 --> 01:43:47,840
and find a trait

2608
01:43:47,840 --> 01:43:49,840
i don't do any of that top-down stuff if

2609
01:43:49,840 --> 01:43:51,280
i just want to come in here and just

2610
01:43:51,280 --> 01:43:52,960
scalp don't even care about what's

2611
01:43:52,960 --> 01:43:54,560
happening on the high time frame don't

2612
01:43:54,560 --> 01:43:55,679
care about

2613
01:43:55,679 --> 01:43:58,639
you know using my brain muscle at all to

2614
01:43:58,639 --> 01:44:00,800
to make any moves

2615
01:44:00,800 --> 01:44:03,840
i may not care about that at all

2616
01:44:03,840 --> 01:44:05,679
and i may just want to come in and get a

2617
01:44:05,679 --> 01:44:07,840
little scalping going on

2618
01:44:07,840 --> 01:44:10,080
this is the exact system you can do this

2619
01:44:10,080 --> 01:44:10,960
with because you could do this with

2620
01:44:10,960 --> 01:44:12,320
scalping you could do this with swing

2621
01:44:12,320 --> 01:44:14,239
trading you could do this with any type

2622
01:44:14,239 --> 01:44:16,719
of trading on any type of time frame

2623
01:44:16,719 --> 01:44:20,239
this all happens the same exact way and

2624
01:44:20,239 --> 01:44:23,520
if you want to know if the market is

2625
01:44:23,520 --> 01:44:26,639
you know bullish or bearish for the long

2626
01:44:26,639 --> 01:44:28,880
term

2627
01:44:29,280 --> 01:44:32,840
this is exactly what you do you start to

2628
01:44:32,840 --> 01:44:36,800
analyze what exactly is happening

2629
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,560
so what do we have

2630
01:44:38,560 --> 01:44:39,840
with

2631
01:44:39,840 --> 01:44:42,560
this time frame we have the low

2632
01:44:42,560 --> 01:44:45,600
we have the high here

2633
01:44:46,080 --> 01:44:48,320
and then we have this low that drops

2634
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,600
it's validated by taking out this low

2635
01:44:51,600 --> 01:44:55,040
and then we have a trade above

2636
01:44:55,360 --> 01:44:56,800
so

2637
01:44:56,800 --> 01:45:00,080
we shouldn't be worried if we see price

2638
01:45:00,080 --> 01:45:02,400
shifting up

2639
01:45:02,400 --> 01:45:03,600
and then

2640
01:45:03,600 --> 01:45:06,719
there's a pullback later on into the day

2641
01:45:06,719 --> 01:45:08,960
where could the pullback go

2642
01:45:08,960 --> 01:45:10,880
the pullback could possibly

2643
01:45:10,880 --> 01:45:14,560
go into this area

2644
01:45:14,639 --> 01:45:17,840
right here

2645
01:45:19,199 --> 01:45:20,639
and then

2646
01:45:20,639 --> 01:45:22,719
take us further

2647
01:45:22,719 --> 01:45:25,679
maybe up to here

2648
01:45:25,679 --> 01:45:28,840
or maybe this can just continue to run

2649
01:45:28,840 --> 01:45:30,560
this

2650
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:33,280
take us down here

2651
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:34,960
into this area

2652
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:37,119
there's no low here price opened up and

2653
01:45:37,119 --> 01:45:39,440
just kept pushing

2654
01:45:39,440 --> 01:45:41,760
so we have within

2655
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:43,199
this low

2656
01:45:43,199 --> 01:45:46,400
which is at 31 200 and we would possibly

2657
01:45:46,400 --> 01:45:47,679
have

2658
01:45:47,679 --> 01:45:49,920
this high

2659
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:52,480
which is at 32 600 and price can do

2660
01:45:52,480 --> 01:45:54,320
whatever it wants in between here it

2661
01:45:54,320 --> 01:45:56,239
could range each day next week in

2662
01:45:56,239 --> 01:45:59,600
between here

2663
01:45:59,600 --> 01:46:01,360
we just know that this is the area that

2664
01:46:01,360 --> 01:46:03,760
it's ranging in but if we do get a

2665
01:46:03,760 --> 01:46:05,040
pullback

2666
01:46:05,040 --> 01:46:07,520
before taking out this high

2667
01:46:07,520 --> 01:46:09,280
and the markets the market can go right

2668
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:13,360
to the high at like 575 let's say

2669
01:46:13,360 --> 01:46:15,360
and then start to pull all the way back

2670
01:46:15,360 --> 01:46:16,639
here

2671
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:19,040
into this area

2672
01:46:19,040 --> 01:46:22,080
at 31 6 31 7.

2673
01:46:22,080 --> 01:46:23,520
and everybody's like oh margaret's

2674
01:46:23,520 --> 01:46:26,239
fallen again it's bearish the bears are

2675
01:46:26,239 --> 01:46:29,040
in control the but the market is it

2676
01:46:29,040 --> 01:46:31,199
shows that there's a there's a potential

2677
01:46:31,199 --> 01:46:32,480
flip

2678
01:46:32,480 --> 01:46:34,480
happening

2679
01:46:34,480 --> 01:46:36,400
so if there's a potential flip happening

2680
01:46:36,400 --> 01:46:38,159
that's not a bearish market that's a

2681
01:46:38,159 --> 01:46:40,639
retracement to continue long and if you

2682
01:46:40,639 --> 01:46:42,719
were trading on the stock market

2683
01:46:42,719 --> 01:46:44,800
that's the area that you would be

2684
01:46:44,800 --> 01:46:46,800
loading up your stocks on

2685
01:46:46,800 --> 01:46:48,159
right here

2686
01:46:48,159 --> 01:46:49,840
at this pullback

2687
01:46:49,840 --> 01:46:51,679
you'd be loading up all of your stocks

2688
01:46:51,679 --> 01:46:53,360
on that area and then you'll see a

2689
01:46:53,360 --> 01:46:55,520
substantial increase

2690
01:46:55,520 --> 01:46:57,679
in in your stocks

2691
01:46:57,679 --> 01:47:00,239
if you just waited for timing

2692
01:47:00,239 --> 01:47:02,080
why are we expecting a pullback here

2693
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:05,600
because also there's possible imbalance

2694
01:47:05,600 --> 01:47:07,360
from this wick

2695
01:47:07,360 --> 01:47:10,000
all the way to the next candle open

2696
01:47:10,000 --> 01:47:12,480
which is monday or sunday i think it is

2697
01:47:12,480 --> 01:47:14,719
sunday in the afternoon

2698
01:47:14,719 --> 01:47:16,639
next candle open

2699
01:47:16,639 --> 01:47:19,360
you might have the next candle open up

2700
01:47:19,360 --> 01:47:22,159
and come in to feel this imbalance

2701
01:47:22,159 --> 01:47:23,840
that's created

2702
01:47:23,840 --> 01:47:26,159
or you might have price just wick back

2703
01:47:26,159 --> 01:47:28,000
into this area

2704
01:47:28,000 --> 01:47:29,440
close here

2705
01:47:29,440 --> 01:47:31,760
or even close here if it wanted to

2706
01:47:31,760 --> 01:47:34,960
and then sunday or monday's candle opens

2707
01:47:34,960 --> 01:47:40,080
up and takes you further above

2708
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:43,520
so it's not a continuation of

2709
01:47:43,520 --> 01:47:45,760
bearishness unless it goes below thirty

2710
01:47:45,760 --> 01:47:48,560
one two hundred

2711
01:47:49,040 --> 01:47:52,400
there's a possibility that it runs there

2712
01:47:52,400 --> 01:47:54,320
but we stated that our bias was bullish

2713
01:47:54,320 --> 01:47:57,520
for the day why

2714
01:47:57,679 --> 01:47:59,520
because we saw that this high was ran

2715
01:47:59,520 --> 01:48:01,119
and we said we could possibly make it up

2716
01:48:01,119 --> 01:48:04,000
to this high that's why i said the the

2717
01:48:04,000 --> 01:48:05,760
analysis in the mornings is literally

2718
01:48:05,760 --> 01:48:08,320
like two minutes

2719
01:48:08,320 --> 01:48:09,280
because

2720
01:48:09,280 --> 01:48:12,719
we have our bias for the day

2721
01:48:12,719 --> 01:48:15,679
and we end up dropping down to

2722
01:48:15,679 --> 01:48:18,960
the one minute i mean sorry the one hour

2723
01:48:18,960 --> 01:48:22,719
to pick up a little more of our bias

2724
01:48:22,800 --> 01:48:25,119
and

2725
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:27,280
what do we have here we said that this

2726
01:48:27,280 --> 01:48:30,320
was an important high to run

2727
01:48:30,320 --> 01:48:32,480
right here

2728
01:48:32,480 --> 01:48:34,800
which yes i mean we see that it was

2729
01:48:34,800 --> 01:48:36,800
important there was a rejection from

2730
01:48:36,800 --> 01:48:38,320
this area

2731
01:48:38,320 --> 01:48:40,639
that took us down

2732
01:48:40,639 --> 01:48:42,239
that rejection that took us down you

2733
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:43,760
guys remember where

2734
01:48:43,760 --> 01:48:47,600
where that was from right

2735
01:48:47,600 --> 01:48:50,480
let me go back to this sorry

2736
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:52,960
right here

2737
01:48:52,960 --> 01:48:55,920
you guys remember where the

2738
01:48:56,719 --> 01:48:59,119
that rejection was from

2739
01:48:59,119 --> 01:49:00,400
here in this trade

2740
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:02,880
that we took

2741
01:49:04,400 --> 01:49:06,480
in this trade coming out of this area

2742
01:49:06,480 --> 01:49:08,080
heading down

2743
01:49:08,080 --> 01:49:09,199
to here

2744
01:49:09,199 --> 01:49:11,040
then flipped bullish

2745
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:14,239
and this is where you get out

2746
01:49:14,239 --> 01:49:15,760
and then

2747
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,840
you have the bearish i mean the the

2748
01:49:17,840 --> 01:49:18,719
bullish

2749
01:49:18,719 --> 01:49:22,159
flip that takes you up to what the area

2750
01:49:22,159 --> 01:49:23,840
that we're trading from and what did i

2751
01:49:23,840 --> 01:49:26,080
say when it taps this area i said

2752
01:49:26,080 --> 01:49:27,040
because

2753
01:49:27,040 --> 01:49:29,119
it'll run this high and tap this area

2754
01:49:29,119 --> 01:49:31,280
you could get a rejection away from it

2755
01:49:31,280 --> 01:49:33,119
what do we have exactly when we tap into

2756
01:49:33,119 --> 01:49:35,520
the area a rejection

2757
01:49:35,520 --> 01:49:37,760
and this rejection away doesn't mean

2758
01:49:37,760 --> 01:49:40,480
that this is gonna come all the way down

2759
01:49:40,480 --> 01:49:44,480
now we have all of this to fill up no

2760
01:49:44,480 --> 01:49:46,960
this this rejection on this what was

2761
01:49:46,960 --> 01:49:49,040
this a one hour area no that doesn't

2762
01:49:49,040 --> 01:49:50,960
mean that

2763
01:49:50,960 --> 01:49:52,960
doesn't mean oh we're gonna go from here

2764
01:49:52,960 --> 01:49:56,800
all the way to running all the lows

2765
01:49:56,800 --> 01:49:58,400
we could have a rejection out of this

2766
01:49:58,400 --> 01:50:02,239
area and price push further up

2767
01:50:02,239 --> 01:50:04,800
it can go just like this here

2768
01:50:04,800 --> 01:50:07,800
here

2769
01:50:10,960 --> 01:50:13,360
and then it comes here creates a weak

2770
01:50:13,360 --> 01:50:15,679
high

2771
01:50:17,360 --> 01:50:19,520
takes out the low

2772
01:50:19,520 --> 01:50:21,840
comes back in

2773
01:50:21,840 --> 01:50:23,360
retraces

2774
01:50:23,360 --> 01:50:24,400
and then

2775
01:50:24,400 --> 01:50:26,639
takes us down to

2776
01:50:26,639 --> 01:50:28,000
the area that we're looking to trade

2777
01:50:28,000 --> 01:50:30,000
from whether it's here

2778
01:50:30,000 --> 01:50:33,040
or whether it's this second area

2779
01:50:33,040 --> 01:50:35,280
or whether it's this third area down

2780
01:50:35,280 --> 01:50:36,639
here

2781
01:50:36,639 --> 01:50:39,520
but we have all this room

2782
01:50:39,520 --> 01:50:42,239
in in the coming day or week or whatever

2783
01:50:42,239 --> 01:50:46,000
it is we have all of this room here

2784
01:50:46,000 --> 01:50:48,960
to trade within

2785
01:50:50,239 --> 01:50:53,840
so this is 32 3

2786
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,199
and 31

2787
01:50:55,199 --> 01:50:58,400
4 or 31 3 if if you want to just

2788
01:50:58,400 --> 01:51:00,000
keep it exact

2789
01:51:00,000 --> 01:51:01,119
so yeah

2790
01:51:01,119 --> 01:51:03,600
you have all of that areas all of that

2791
01:51:03,600 --> 01:51:06,000
area that price could trade into after

2792
01:51:06,000 --> 01:51:08,400
being rejected from here but then make

2793
01:51:08,400 --> 01:51:10,320
no mistake it could also go up into the

2794
01:51:10,320 --> 01:51:12,960
middle of the area and then reject out

2795
01:51:12,960 --> 01:51:14,080
of there

2796
01:51:14,080 --> 01:51:15,679
and take us down to

2797
01:51:15,679 --> 01:51:17,440
whatever whatever area is going to

2798
01:51:17,440 --> 01:51:18,560
mitigate

2799
01:51:18,560 --> 01:51:21,280
and then a continuation or a break above

2800
01:51:21,280 --> 01:51:22,159
this

2801
01:51:22,159 --> 01:51:23,679
so i know a lot of people are bearish on

2802
01:51:23,679 --> 01:51:25,440
the market because all of the falling

2803
01:51:25,440 --> 01:51:27,040
that is done over the past you know

2804
01:51:27,040 --> 01:51:29,199
whatever time um like i said we got a

2805
01:51:29,199 --> 01:51:31,119
bullish flip earlier

2806
01:51:31,119 --> 01:51:32,080
um

2807
01:51:32,080 --> 01:51:34,480
last night actually yesterday then we

2808
01:51:34,480 --> 01:51:37,440
had price push up a little more um today

2809
01:51:37,440 --> 01:51:39,760
if you look at the s p the s p is what

2810
01:51:39,760 --> 01:51:43,119
all the stocks follow every like

2811
01:51:43,119 --> 01:51:45,280
not all of let me actually give factual

2812
01:51:45,280 --> 01:51:48,719
information the indices follow s p

2813
01:51:48,719 --> 01:51:50,639
because if you look at the indices

2814
01:51:50,639 --> 01:51:53,440
right here um this is actually s p as

2815
01:51:53,440 --> 01:51:55,760
well but this is s p on the the stock

2816
01:51:55,760 --> 01:51:58,080
market this is spy this is an option

2817
01:51:58,080 --> 01:51:58,880
that

2818
01:51:58,880 --> 01:52:02,080
people trade but it's a mirror of the

2819
01:52:02,080 --> 01:52:05,280
actual smp market so this was the s p

2820
01:52:05,280 --> 01:52:07,199
market this is

2821
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,560
you know you see

2822
01:52:08,560 --> 01:52:10,800
we started out opened and had this huge

2823
01:52:10,800 --> 01:52:13,440
push up and that's crazy how how far was

2824
01:52:13,440 --> 01:52:16,679
this push

2825
01:52:17,800 --> 01:52:20,880
768 pips since we opened

2826
01:52:20,880 --> 01:52:22,960
that's outrageous

2827
01:52:22,960 --> 01:52:24,960
i mean some people catch these whole

2828
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:26,320
pushes up

2829
01:52:26,320 --> 01:52:29,040
usually me at scalp in between this and

2830
01:52:29,040 --> 01:52:30,880
probably end up with more than this

2831
01:52:30,880 --> 01:52:32,159
whole push

2832
01:52:32,159 --> 01:52:33,760
you know because you can time a lot of

2833
01:52:33,760 --> 01:52:35,040
these moves

2834
01:52:35,040 --> 01:52:36,719
so you can be buying and selling on the

2835
01:52:36,719 --> 01:52:37,679
market

2836
01:52:37,679 --> 01:52:40,880
but we had this push up

2837
01:52:40,880 --> 01:52:42,800
and if you look at

2838
01:52:42,800 --> 01:52:45,040
the other stocks i mean sorry the the

2839
01:52:45,040 --> 01:52:46,800
other indices

2840
01:52:46,800 --> 01:52:49,760
we had the same push up

2841
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:51,199
nasdaq

2842
01:52:51,199 --> 01:52:56,000
same push up and this is all from 9 30.

2843
01:52:56,080 --> 01:52:57,599
japan

2844
01:52:57,599 --> 01:53:00,239
same push-up

2845
01:53:00,239 --> 01:53:01,360
germany

2846
01:53:01,360 --> 01:53:03,520
same push-up

2847
01:53:03,520 --> 01:53:07,040
hong kong same push-up they all follow

2848
01:53:07,040 --> 01:53:08,639
each other

2849
01:53:08,639 --> 01:53:11,199
but they mostly follow

2850
01:53:11,199 --> 01:53:15,199
this smp here the us500

2851
01:53:15,199 --> 01:53:17,840
so if you ever want to you know kind of

2852
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:19,840
like get an idea of what could be

2853
01:53:19,840 --> 01:53:22,560
happening or what may happen next in the

2854
01:53:22,560 --> 01:53:25,360
market time it with this

2855
01:53:25,360 --> 01:53:28,960
time it with with us 500

2856
01:53:28,960 --> 01:53:30,480
and when you time it with this since

2857
01:53:30,480 --> 01:53:34,320
this is the heavy mover in the market

2858
01:53:34,320 --> 01:53:36,320
and this has stocks that are on these

2859
01:53:36,320 --> 01:53:38,639
other stock exchanges as well

2860
01:53:38,639 --> 01:53:42,400
this moves those other exchanges

2861
01:53:42,400 --> 01:53:44,400
so this is the second thing to kind of

2862
01:53:44,400 --> 01:53:46,480
you know give you an idea of

2863
01:53:46,480 --> 01:53:49,040
maybe the market is is bearish today and

2864
01:53:49,040 --> 01:53:52,000
and i will say though there are times

2865
01:53:52,000 --> 01:53:52,800
that

2866
01:53:52,800 --> 01:53:55,119
this is pushing up and other markets are

2867
01:53:55,119 --> 01:53:56,560
pushing away

2868
01:53:56,560 --> 01:53:58,080
japan might be pushing away because

2869
01:53:58,080 --> 01:53:59,599
they're in recession or whatever might

2870
01:53:59,599 --> 01:54:01,520
be taking place you know germany might

2871
01:54:01,520 --> 01:54:03,040
have had a terrorist attack or whatever

2872
01:54:03,040 --> 01:54:05,199
it is or london you know hong kong could

2873
01:54:05,199 --> 01:54:07,679
be dealing with covet and all of those

2874
01:54:07,679 --> 01:54:09,679
things are shifting these markets down

2875
01:54:09,679 --> 01:54:11,920
but this market is still pushing up

2876
01:54:11,920 --> 01:54:13,760
but the likelihood of hong kong dealing

2877
01:54:13,760 --> 01:54:16,400
with covet and having issues that will

2878
01:54:16,400 --> 01:54:18,320
affect our market too

2879
01:54:18,320 --> 01:54:20,320
because we're a huge consumer

2880
01:54:20,320 --> 01:54:22,719
um when it comes to the the products

2881
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:25,440
that that the con the country has

2882
01:54:25,440 --> 01:54:26,800
so

2883
01:54:26,800 --> 01:54:29,280
you can time this during a new york

2884
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,280
session pay attention to this during a

2885
01:54:31,280 --> 01:54:32,560
new york session

2886
01:54:32,560 --> 01:54:35,520
and this will kind of be your guide on

2887
01:54:35,520 --> 01:54:37,760
trading any other indices that you

2888
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:39,599
possibly trade because look all of them

2889
01:54:39,599 --> 01:54:41,040
are retracing now

2890
01:54:41,040 --> 01:54:44,480
each and every one of them are retracing

2891
01:54:44,480 --> 01:54:46,239
they all have slightly different levels

2892
01:54:46,239 --> 01:54:48,480
you can see because some markets are

2893
01:54:48,480 --> 01:54:51,440
open and some markets are not

2894
01:54:51,440 --> 01:54:53,679
slightly different levels

2895
01:54:53,679 --> 01:54:56,400
this even super different level than

2896
01:54:56,400 --> 01:54:58,320
than s p has

2897
01:54:58,320 --> 01:55:00,159
smp has this little bit here which

2898
01:55:00,159 --> 01:55:02,840
consulted sideways but kept pushing

2899
01:55:02,840 --> 01:55:07,440
up you know and they have this huge dip

2900
01:55:07,440 --> 01:55:09,840
followed by this slow

2901
01:55:09,840 --> 01:55:11,599
you know push-up

2902
01:55:11,599 --> 01:55:13,599
and that happens because

2903
01:55:13,599 --> 01:55:15,920
they're not trading right now within

2904
01:55:15,920 --> 01:55:18,800
this this market it's 12 o'clock the

2905
01:55:18,800 --> 01:55:20,159
trading day is done

2906
01:55:20,159 --> 01:55:23,920
but their market still follows ours

2907
01:55:23,920 --> 01:55:25,760
because all the money intertwined in

2908
01:55:25,760 --> 01:55:27,599
these different systems and stuff

2909
01:55:27,599 --> 01:55:28,560
there's

2910
01:55:28,560 --> 01:55:31,199
you could definitely use this as a guide

2911
01:55:31,199 --> 01:55:32,480
during a new york session and if you're

2912
01:55:32,480 --> 01:55:34,560
trading in the asian session

2913
01:55:34,560 --> 01:55:38,560
here we go use hong kong use japan

2914
01:55:38,560 --> 01:55:42,400
use these to to trade the asian session

2915
01:55:42,400 --> 01:55:44,719
trade with asian pears because there's

2916
01:55:44,719 --> 01:55:45,599
more

2917
01:55:45,599 --> 01:55:48,800
money more volume involved within that

2918
01:55:48,800 --> 01:55:50,000
time frame

2919
01:55:50,000 --> 01:55:51,360
because look at this let me let me

2920
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:52,719
actually just show you guys this i know

2921
01:55:52,719 --> 01:55:54,000
you guys are probably like shut up and

2922
01:55:54,000 --> 01:55:56,880
go to the charts but this is is useful

2923
01:55:56,880 --> 01:55:58,560
information for me this is how i was

2924
01:55:58,560 --> 01:56:00,400
using six hundred dollars to make a

2925
01:56:00,400 --> 01:56:03,119
thousand dollars a day

2926
01:56:03,119 --> 01:56:05,760
because i was paying attention to to the

2927
01:56:05,760 --> 01:56:08,400
things that happened so look at this

2928
01:56:08,400 --> 01:56:10,960
this is

2929
01:56:12,800 --> 01:56:15,440
seven o'clock right here

2930
01:56:15,440 --> 01:56:18,560
this is seven o'clock

2931
01:56:18,719 --> 01:56:21,360
asian session yesterday so this is eight

2932
01:56:21,360 --> 01:56:22,639
this is

2933
01:56:22,639 --> 01:56:24,960
seven

2934
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:28,800
right here

2935
01:56:28,800 --> 01:56:32,239
look at this look at this madness

2936
01:56:33,760 --> 01:56:36,000
look at this

2937
01:56:36,000 --> 01:56:37,599
out

2938
01:56:37,599 --> 01:56:38,800
rages

2939
01:56:38,800 --> 01:56:40,719
you know why this happened

2940
01:56:40,719 --> 01:56:43,280
because hong kong came out and said

2941
01:56:43,280 --> 01:56:45,280
well shanghai sorry

2942
01:56:45,280 --> 01:56:48,880
shanghai one adopted bitcoin as a

2943
01:56:48,880 --> 01:56:51,280
virtual currency within the country so

2944
01:56:51,280 --> 01:56:53,199
now it's legalized

2945
01:56:53,199 --> 01:56:53,920
to

2946
01:56:53,920 --> 01:56:56,400
own the asset as a virtual currency

2947
01:56:56,400 --> 01:56:57,840
after they were just going through a

2948
01:56:57,840 --> 01:56:59,920
bunch of banning and relisting and

2949
01:56:59,920 --> 01:57:02,080
banning and relisting so now

2950
01:57:02,080 --> 01:57:04,560
you have that push up that added into

2951
01:57:04,560 --> 01:57:06,159
that

2952
01:57:06,159 --> 01:57:08,639
you also have it to where they're kind

2953
01:57:08,639 --> 01:57:10,719
of getting their covet situation under

2954
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:12,239
control

2955
01:57:12,239 --> 01:57:14,000
because before it was affecting the

2956
01:57:14,000 --> 01:57:15,199
market

2957
01:57:15,199 --> 01:57:17,119
their covet situation

2958
01:57:17,119 --> 01:57:20,960
was tanking the markets this was back in

2959
01:57:20,960 --> 01:57:23,199
and this is not even just

2960
01:57:23,199 --> 01:57:25,280
if i go to the daily it goes further out

2961
01:57:25,280 --> 01:57:27,760
but it was tanking the market

2962
01:57:27,760 --> 01:57:30,239
but their covet situation got better

2963
01:57:30,239 --> 01:57:35,040
and look how quickly the market rebound

2964
01:57:35,679 --> 01:57:37,599
you know you have it coming down to this

2965
01:57:37,599 --> 01:57:39,760
area

2966
01:57:39,760 --> 01:57:44,320
a day and 18 hours i think that said

2967
01:57:44,320 --> 01:57:47,280
a day in two hours

2968
01:57:47,280 --> 01:57:50,159
you know or a day in an hour

2969
01:57:50,159 --> 01:57:52,080
recovery was quick because those things

2970
01:57:52,080 --> 01:57:55,440
happen in simultaneously

2971
01:57:55,440 --> 01:57:57,280
so if you want to trade in the asian

2972
01:57:57,280 --> 01:57:58,320
session

2973
01:57:58,320 --> 01:58:00,000
you could use these principles in the

2974
01:58:00,000 --> 01:58:02,400
asian session i can go i don't know just

2975
01:58:02,400 --> 01:58:06,360
somewhere random uh

2976
01:58:11,920 --> 01:58:13,520
and see look just to be transparent with

2977
01:58:13,520 --> 01:58:14,719
you guys

2978
01:58:14,719 --> 01:58:16,560
i i mean i wouldn't have been trading in

2979
01:58:16,560 --> 01:58:18,320
this session anyway this is this is

2980
01:58:18,320 --> 01:58:21,360
spread hour yeah so there's there's no

2981
01:58:21,360 --> 01:58:22,880
inhale that i've been trading that so

2982
01:58:22,880 --> 01:58:24,639
let me move away from that

2983
01:58:24,639 --> 01:58:26,960
um

2984
01:58:28,400 --> 01:58:30,080
you know so you

2985
01:58:30,080 --> 01:58:32,320
i mean this is just trending up really

2986
01:58:32,320 --> 01:58:35,840
the the way that i

2987
01:58:35,920 --> 01:58:38,159
would have probably gotten involved in

2988
01:58:38,159 --> 01:58:40,800
this is

2989
01:58:41,199 --> 01:58:44,080
you know until i saw something bearish

2990
01:58:44,080 --> 01:58:46,840
possibly let me see

2991
01:58:46,840 --> 01:58:50,320
uh pushed up came back in ran the low

2992
01:58:50,320 --> 01:58:52,880
nope that wouldn't have been taken

2993
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:54,960
uh and and i'm i'm showing you guys this

2994
01:58:54,960 --> 01:58:56,239
just to

2995
01:58:56,239 --> 01:58:58,159
you know be transparent with you guys as

2996
01:58:58,159 --> 01:58:58,880
to

2997
01:58:58,880 --> 01:59:00,320
you know what trades that i would

2998
01:59:00,320 --> 01:59:02,400
consider taking and

2999
01:59:02,400 --> 01:59:04,400
what i wouldn't consider taking so this

3000
01:59:04,400 --> 01:59:08,400
one here this is possible let me see

3001
01:59:08,400 --> 01:59:10,320
right here

3002
01:59:10,320 --> 01:59:13,119
to here

3003
01:59:14,480 --> 01:59:18,080
you see in that just missed

3004
01:59:18,239 --> 01:59:20,719
yeah that just missed it

3005
01:59:20,719 --> 01:59:21,760
right here

3006
01:59:21,760 --> 01:59:24,480
wick flew above the area came back in

3007
01:59:24,480 --> 01:59:27,360
just missed it and left

3008
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,599
so there there are times where

3009
01:59:29,599 --> 01:59:32,320
your setup wouldn't actually

3010
01:59:32,320 --> 01:59:35,040
happen the the way that it's supposed to

3011
01:59:35,040 --> 01:59:36,719
and that's okay

3012
01:59:36,719 --> 01:59:39,040
that's fine that's okay

3013
01:59:39,040 --> 01:59:41,199
you know so

3014
01:59:41,199 --> 01:59:43,440
this obviously was was

3015
01:59:43,440 --> 01:59:45,360
through the asian session and into the

3016
01:59:45,360 --> 01:59:47,360
night that this slowly moved but this is

3017
01:59:47,360 --> 01:59:49,760
hong kong

3018
01:59:49,760 --> 01:59:52,400
the pair that i've seen that that moves

3019
01:59:52,400 --> 01:59:54,000
a lot better

3020
01:59:54,000 --> 01:59:56,320
in a lot of um you know those asian

3021
01:59:56,320 --> 01:59:59,679
sessions are this japan session look

3022
01:59:59,679 --> 02:00:01,440
look at the bias that i had this was

3023
02:00:01,440 --> 02:00:03,760
yesterday

3024
02:00:03,760 --> 02:00:05,280
took a trade here yesterday in the asian

3025
02:00:05,280 --> 02:00:07,440
session this was not the stop loss i

3026
02:00:07,440 --> 02:00:09,440
don't know where exactly the stop loss

3027
02:00:09,440 --> 02:00:12,960
was the stop loss was here

3028
02:00:12,960 --> 02:00:15,119
right here let me see

3029
02:00:15,119 --> 02:00:18,800
yeah the stop loss was here

3030
02:00:19,760 --> 02:00:22,239
the stop loss is right here

3031
02:00:22,239 --> 02:00:23,679
and

3032
02:00:23,679 --> 02:00:25,280
you had a trade come right into this

3033
02:00:25,280 --> 02:00:27,840
area what did i mention

3034
02:00:27,840 --> 02:00:30,239
about

3035
02:00:31,199 --> 02:00:33,520
the flips

3036
02:00:33,520 --> 02:00:36,719
you know you have this low

3037
02:00:36,719 --> 02:00:38,800
the sideways

3038
02:00:38,800 --> 02:00:40,560
movement that that could be a high

3039
02:00:40,560 --> 02:00:42,320
possibly

3040
02:00:42,320 --> 02:00:45,679
you know but you have this low

3041
02:00:46,639 --> 02:00:47,840
comes up

3042
02:00:47,840 --> 02:00:50,880
trades below gives us our pullback but

3043
02:00:50,880 --> 02:00:53,199
what do you also have another high being

3044
02:00:53,199 --> 02:00:55,520
taken out this high

3045
02:00:55,520 --> 02:00:57,599
so what did i say about these highs that

3046
02:00:57,599 --> 02:00:59,440
are taken out

3047
02:00:59,440 --> 02:01:01,520
that could be the thing that that's

3048
02:01:01,520 --> 02:01:03,599
causing the retracement

3049
02:01:03,599 --> 02:01:06,000
the high being ran so what do we have

3050
02:01:06,000 --> 02:01:07,360
here

3051
02:01:07,360 --> 02:01:08,560
we had

3052
02:01:08,560 --> 02:01:11,599
this high ran by this wick price pull

3053
02:01:11,599 --> 02:01:13,920
back into this area

3054
02:01:13,920 --> 02:01:15,679
here's

3055
02:01:15,679 --> 02:01:17,920
where

3056
02:01:18,000 --> 02:01:19,760
your stops go

3057
02:01:19,760 --> 02:01:22,560
directly behind there

3058
02:01:22,560 --> 02:01:25,199
and you take it long

3059
02:01:25,199 --> 02:01:27,440
obviously when i saw price push up above

3060
02:01:27,440 --> 02:01:29,360
this and push up above the area to the

3061
02:01:29,360 --> 02:01:32,159
left i said that it would push further i

3062
02:01:32,159 --> 02:01:34,320
had this yellow yellow candle here

3063
02:01:34,320 --> 02:01:36,960
before this even started and um i said

3064
02:01:36,960 --> 02:01:38,719
that it would push further possibly to

3065
02:01:38,719 --> 02:01:40,560
these areas why because remember i

3066
02:01:40,560 --> 02:01:42,960
talked about volume

3067
02:01:42,960 --> 02:01:44,960
you can take it to these areas that have

3068
02:01:44,960 --> 02:01:46,960
volume

3069
02:01:46,960 --> 02:01:49,119
and that would have been the target you

3070
02:01:49,119 --> 02:01:50,719
see we got a little rejection out of

3071
02:01:50,719 --> 02:01:52,320
there but then

3072
02:01:52,320 --> 02:01:55,280
what do we have here

3073
02:01:58,080 --> 02:01:59,920
little rejection out

3074
02:01:59,920 --> 02:02:02,639
then we have price trade above

3075
02:02:02,639 --> 02:02:05,599
and what can we see this as

3076
02:02:05,599 --> 02:02:09,040
price traded above the high

3077
02:02:09,119 --> 02:02:12,960
after giving us a new low

3078
02:02:13,119 --> 02:02:15,040
traded above the high we're looking for

3079
02:02:15,040 --> 02:02:17,760
price to come back into the area

3080
02:02:17,760 --> 02:02:20,719
and then we're taking it long

3081
02:02:20,719 --> 02:02:24,480
so that's another entry there

3082
02:02:24,480 --> 02:02:26,560
and you just follow that system without

3083
02:02:26,560 --> 02:02:29,040
and any market whatever it is that you

3084
02:02:29,040 --> 02:02:31,119
need to analyze anything that you need

3085
02:02:31,119 --> 02:02:32,400
to look at

3086
02:02:32,400 --> 02:02:33,840
you know anything that you'd like to

3087
02:02:33,840 --> 02:02:36,480
trade i'm telling you you know this is

3088
02:02:36,480 --> 02:02:40,239
forex this is stocks this is everything

3089
02:02:40,239 --> 02:02:41,520
out there

3090
02:02:41,520 --> 02:02:44,080
everything out there

3091
02:02:44,080 --> 02:02:46,960
this is everything what did i say that

3092
02:02:46,960 --> 02:02:49,040
that we would have here i said that if

3093
02:02:49,040 --> 02:02:51,040
price came below here the protected high

3094
02:02:51,040 --> 02:02:52,400
we would end up going bearish and

3095
02:02:52,400 --> 02:02:55,440
possibly going bearish into what area

3096
02:02:55,440 --> 02:02:57,119
what area that i said we could go

3097
02:02:57,119 --> 02:02:58,400
bearish into

3098
02:02:58,400 --> 02:03:01,360
the original area that we spotted that

3099
02:03:01,360 --> 02:03:03,840
price didn't pull back into look at what

3100
02:03:03,840 --> 02:03:05,920
this bad boy did

3101
02:03:05,920 --> 02:03:07,119
came

3102
02:03:07,119 --> 02:03:10,159
touched the area

3103
02:03:10,960 --> 02:03:14,080
i left

3104
02:03:14,080 --> 02:03:17,040
68 pips

3105
02:03:17,040 --> 02:03:20,320
after touching the area

3106
02:03:20,320 --> 02:03:21,920
i said we would have a pullback in there

3107
02:03:21,920 --> 02:03:23,440
i said when price doesn't come back to

3108
02:03:23,440 --> 02:03:25,679
this area you save it

3109
02:03:25,679 --> 02:03:29,199
you save it for later

3110
02:03:29,199 --> 02:03:33,280
and when it makes it back into this area

3111
02:03:33,280 --> 02:03:35,599
then

3112
02:03:35,599 --> 02:03:37,199
you take it long

3113
02:03:37,199 --> 02:03:39,520
and you could either take it long from

3114
02:03:39,520 --> 02:03:43,840
this particular area here

3115
02:03:47,119 --> 02:03:50,080
from this area here to another area

3116
02:03:50,080 --> 02:03:52,080
which is i always say you know look to

3117
02:03:52,080 --> 02:03:54,960
target the s and d zones or the the

3118
02:03:54,960 --> 02:03:56,719
structural highs

3119
02:03:56,719 --> 02:03:58,960
you know since we don't have any um

3120
02:03:58,960 --> 02:04:01,040
really here that's

3121
02:04:01,040 --> 02:04:03,280
that's um

3122
02:04:03,280 --> 02:04:05,360
you know like a stronger area of

3123
02:04:05,360 --> 02:04:07,679
structure this is not

3124
02:04:07,679 --> 02:04:08,560
so

3125
02:04:08,560 --> 02:04:11,360
i wouldn't have been taking this to the

3126
02:04:11,360 --> 02:04:13,199
high i would end up taking it to the

3127
02:04:13,199 --> 02:04:14,639
midway

3128
02:04:14,639 --> 02:04:17,280
and then the reaction that i get out of

3129
02:04:17,280 --> 02:04:20,800
it i'm watching to see if there's a

3130
02:04:20,800 --> 02:04:23,360
possible cell

3131
02:04:23,360 --> 02:04:26,000
coming up within this area

3132
02:04:26,000 --> 02:04:28,639
you know high low high

3133
02:04:28,639 --> 02:04:31,679
low high

3134
02:04:32,239 --> 02:04:34,320
then we well actually this is high low

3135
02:04:34,320 --> 02:04:35,599
high

3136
02:04:35,599 --> 02:04:40,480
i wonder which one came first let me see

3137
02:04:42,400 --> 02:04:45,920
yeah which one came first

3138
02:04:47,760 --> 02:04:52,520
so it looks like the high then the low

3139
02:04:52,639 --> 02:04:54,560
so this took us further up brought us

3140
02:04:54,560 --> 02:04:55,679
down

3141
02:04:55,679 --> 02:04:58,159
okay so

3142
02:04:58,159 --> 02:05:01,440
we'll we'll take a look at this

3143
02:05:01,440 --> 02:05:03,440
you know take a look at this and see how

3144
02:05:03,440 --> 02:05:05,440
price responds to it

3145
02:05:05,440 --> 02:05:07,440
and you could potentially have it where

3146
02:05:07,440 --> 02:05:09,520
price may

3147
02:05:09,520 --> 02:05:11,040
i don't know

3148
02:05:11,040 --> 02:05:14,159
come to like this area or maybe even

3149
02:05:14,159 --> 02:05:16,400
this area

3150
02:05:16,400 --> 02:05:18,400
the potential that price taps back into

3151
02:05:18,400 --> 02:05:19,840
the s d

3152
02:05:19,840 --> 02:05:21,760
rejects away from it

3153
02:05:21,760 --> 02:05:25,440
and then takes us down a little more

3154
02:05:26,000 --> 02:05:28,800
and this is trading against the trend

3155
02:05:28,800 --> 02:05:30,960
because what we might have just flipped

3156
02:05:30,960 --> 02:05:33,960
bullish

3157
02:05:35,360 --> 02:05:37,679
so if we just flipped bullish

3158
02:05:37,679 --> 02:05:40,400
this may not necessarily be an area that

3159
02:05:40,400 --> 02:05:42,719
you're shorting from

3160
02:05:42,719 --> 02:05:43,760
until

3161
02:05:43,760 --> 02:05:48,199
we see some more bearish behavior

3162
02:05:48,239 --> 02:05:52,159
but what we took out this high

3163
02:05:52,800 --> 02:05:54,960
now we didn't get anything there

3164
02:05:54,960 --> 02:05:56,880
and we didn't get any retracement down

3165
02:05:56,880 --> 02:05:59,119
here

3166
02:05:59,679 --> 02:06:01,040
so

3167
02:06:01,040 --> 02:06:03,840
this would technically

3168
02:06:04,880 --> 02:06:09,040
you know still possibly be bullish

3169
02:06:09,040 --> 02:06:10,320
unless

3170
02:06:10,320 --> 02:06:12,000
we see a low ran

3171
02:06:12,000 --> 02:06:15,119
but again this low was ran here

3172
02:06:15,119 --> 02:06:18,080
so that puts us in an area where it's

3173
02:06:18,080 --> 02:06:21,199
you know possible catch 22. we have this

3174
02:06:21,199 --> 02:06:23,760
that comes up sometimes

3175
02:06:23,760 --> 02:06:26,480
you know these seconds areas that that

3176
02:06:26,480 --> 02:06:29,040
it runs and we want a body closure below

3177
02:06:29,040 --> 02:06:32,560
which we got right here a body closure

3178
02:06:32,560 --> 02:06:34,960
then we had to push up and remember what

3179
02:06:34,960 --> 02:06:36,960
i said the weak high usually runs the

3180
02:06:36,960 --> 02:06:40,480
low we could potentially have that

3181
02:06:40,480 --> 02:06:44,119
and with

3182
02:06:44,159 --> 02:06:46,320
this area here

3183
02:06:46,320 --> 02:06:48,079
and having your stop-loss directly

3184
02:06:48,079 --> 02:06:50,560
behind

3185
02:06:50,880 --> 02:06:52,639
you know like the

3186
02:06:52,639 --> 02:06:55,840
the traders on youtube you know you

3187
02:06:55,840 --> 02:06:58,880
you would have garnered 15 pips or so

3188
02:06:58,880 --> 02:07:00,159
you know

3189
02:07:00,159 --> 02:07:02,480
and partial out oh good job chat you

3190
02:07:02,480 --> 02:07:03,360
know

3191
02:07:03,360 --> 02:07:05,119
we hit the money

3192
02:07:05,119 --> 02:07:06,960
you know and this is just because you

3193
02:07:06,960 --> 02:07:09,040
don't know where it's going

3194
02:07:09,040 --> 02:07:11,840
or you don't have an idea of

3195
02:07:11,840 --> 02:07:16,560
what potentially is happening with price

3196
02:07:16,880 --> 02:07:17,599
so

3197
02:07:17,599 --> 02:07:19,679
you could have

3198
02:07:19,679 --> 02:07:20,570
price go

3199
02:07:20,570 --> 02:07:23,520
[Music]

3200
02:07:23,520 --> 02:07:27,599
down into this area a little further

3201
02:07:27,599 --> 02:07:28,719
and then

3202
02:07:28,719 --> 02:07:31,119
come out of the area

3203
02:07:31,119 --> 02:07:33,040
because we know that this may not be the

3204
02:07:33,040 --> 02:07:35,040
possible final rejection what might be

3205
02:07:35,040 --> 02:07:38,880
the possible final rejection this here

3206
02:07:38,880 --> 02:07:41,840
this area

3207
02:07:44,159 --> 02:07:46,800
and this could be the final rejection

3208
02:07:46,800 --> 02:07:48,880
to send everything down

3209
02:07:48,880 --> 02:07:51,360
from here

3210
02:07:53,119 --> 02:07:55,520
that's a possibility

3211
02:07:55,520 --> 02:07:57,280
because we still didn't have price come

3212
02:07:57,280 --> 02:07:59,040
to this area

3213
02:07:59,040 --> 02:08:01,920
so we could have it go up to this area

3214
02:08:01,920 --> 02:08:03,199
tap

3215
02:08:03,199 --> 02:08:05,280
come down to this area

3216
02:08:05,280 --> 02:08:06,159
tap

3217
02:08:06,159 --> 02:08:09,920
and then take us up into

3218
02:08:09,920 --> 02:08:12,880
this area here

3219
02:08:15,440 --> 02:08:17,840
and that could be a possibility

3220
02:08:17,840 --> 02:08:21,520
with the movement of price

3221
02:08:21,599 --> 02:08:23,040
so it's

3222
02:08:23,040 --> 02:08:25,520
taking out the lows

3223
02:08:25,520 --> 02:08:27,280
running the highs

3224
02:08:27,280 --> 02:08:29,280
running the lows again

3225
02:08:29,280 --> 02:08:31,199
specifically some of the equal lows

3226
02:08:31,199 --> 02:08:32,320
possibly

3227
02:08:32,320 --> 02:08:35,520
coming back into an area that it left

3228
02:08:35,520 --> 02:08:37,760
earlier today

3229
02:08:37,760 --> 02:08:39,840
and then trading long from it

3230
02:08:39,840 --> 02:08:42,320
and that's how you create a bias

3231
02:08:42,320 --> 02:08:43,440
for

3232
02:08:43,440 --> 02:08:45,360
what could potentially be happening with

3233
02:08:45,360 --> 02:08:46,400
price

3234
02:08:46,400 --> 02:08:48,719
and even though i have this

3235
02:08:48,719 --> 02:08:50,400
i'm still looking

3236
02:08:50,400 --> 02:08:52,639
at price overall

3237
02:08:52,639 --> 02:08:56,480
i'm still paying attention to in here

3238
02:08:56,480 --> 02:09:00,000
so yes i see it i see this happening i'm

3239
02:09:00,000 --> 02:09:02,079
not jumping into a cell right here just

3240
02:09:02,079 --> 02:09:04,480
because i i had it possibly going down

3241
02:09:04,480 --> 02:09:06,239
to this area then back up

3242
02:09:06,239 --> 02:09:08,159
i'm not doing that

3243
02:09:08,159 --> 02:09:11,119
because that's reckless

3244
02:09:11,119 --> 02:09:13,360
for me what i'm doing is

3245
02:09:13,360 --> 02:09:16,840
waiting for price to come to my optimal

3246
02:09:16,840 --> 02:09:18,400
areas

3247
02:09:18,400 --> 02:09:21,280
the areas that the prices is most likely

3248
02:09:21,280 --> 02:09:24,159
to react from

3249
02:09:24,159 --> 02:09:27,840
not trying to catch a ride with price to

3250
02:09:27,840 --> 02:09:31,280
you know the areas that i'm going

3251
02:09:31,599 --> 02:09:33,599
so if this invalidates and this pushes

3252
02:09:33,599 --> 02:09:35,360
up to here

3253
02:09:35,360 --> 02:09:37,040
it doesn't necessarily mean that the

3254
02:09:37,040 --> 02:09:38,400
rest of this

3255
02:09:38,400 --> 02:09:39,520
is

3256
02:09:39,520 --> 02:09:41,119
is not true

3257
02:09:41,119 --> 02:09:43,360
it can just be this one area

3258
02:09:43,360 --> 02:09:46,320
and this area can push into here tap out

3259
02:09:46,320 --> 02:09:48,639
of there run all the lows that it was

3260
02:09:48,639 --> 02:09:51,599
establishing along these areas

3261
02:09:51,599 --> 02:09:53,520
run all the lows

3262
02:09:53,520 --> 02:09:55,840
take out all the stop losses here run

3263
02:09:55,840 --> 02:09:58,560
the lows on the bottom side here

3264
02:09:58,560 --> 02:10:01,760
tap into this area that went unmitigated

3265
02:10:01,760 --> 02:10:03,679
and then start running the highs from

3266
02:10:03,679 --> 02:10:05,920
the top side with the people selling in

3267
02:10:05,920 --> 02:10:08,560
so that's why you never stay

3268
02:10:08,560 --> 02:10:10,159
in a trade

3269
02:10:10,159 --> 02:10:12,719
on this time frame and expect it to go

3270
02:10:12,719 --> 02:10:14,880
within a daily time frame because

3271
02:10:14,880 --> 02:10:18,400
there's a bunch of pullbacks within that

3272
02:10:18,400 --> 02:10:20,079
area to get there

3273
02:10:20,079 --> 02:10:20,800
and

3274
02:10:20,800 --> 02:10:22,480
you know depending on where your stops

3275
02:10:22,480 --> 02:10:25,920
are it could easily get hit

3276
02:10:25,920 --> 02:10:28,639
so more than likely you want a pullback

3277
02:10:28,639 --> 02:10:31,280
that that's going in a daily direction

3278
02:10:31,280 --> 02:10:33,520
and you're hoping to catch the top or

3279
02:10:33,520 --> 02:10:34,960
the bottom of that

3280
02:10:34,960 --> 02:10:36,480
and how do you catch the top and the

3281
02:10:36,480 --> 02:10:37,840
bottom with that with these same

3282
02:10:37,840 --> 02:10:40,639
principles that we teach every day here

3283
02:10:40,639 --> 02:10:42,639
on this chart

3284
02:10:42,639 --> 02:10:44,560
every single day we teach these

3285
02:10:44,560 --> 02:10:46,400
principles

3286
02:10:46,400 --> 02:10:48,880
and you could use these trading

3287
02:10:48,880 --> 02:10:51,679
anything and the way you become better

3288
02:10:51,679 --> 02:10:52,639
at it

3289
02:10:52,639 --> 02:10:53,440
is

3290
02:10:53,440 --> 02:10:55,520
truthfully speaking the more time that

3291
02:10:55,520 --> 02:10:57,280
you put in

3292
02:10:57,280 --> 02:10:59,040
if you put in

3293
02:10:59,040 --> 02:11:01,119
a good amount of time

3294
02:11:01,119 --> 02:11:03,599
to study to learn and observe these

3295
02:11:03,599 --> 02:11:06,159
things happen when they're happening i'm

3296
02:11:06,159 --> 02:11:08,639
telling you your whole life will be

3297
02:11:08,639 --> 02:11:09,760
changed

3298
02:11:09,760 --> 02:11:11,520
your trading style

3299
02:11:11,520 --> 02:11:13,760
you'd find it that it's a lot easier for

3300
02:11:13,760 --> 02:11:15,679
you to come into the market spend an

3301
02:11:15,679 --> 02:11:17,679
hour a day maybe an hour and 30 minutes

3302
02:11:17,679 --> 02:11:19,760
and then just get out of there

3303
02:11:19,760 --> 02:11:22,639
no reason for you to stick around

3304
02:11:22,639 --> 02:11:24,480
and you'll learn that

3305
02:11:24,480 --> 02:11:27,119
you know with

3306
02:11:27,119 --> 02:11:28,560
with things like this

3307
02:11:28,560 --> 02:11:30,000
i remember what i told you guys about

3308
02:11:30,000 --> 02:11:32,239
the the equal high here

3309
02:11:32,239 --> 02:11:34,400
i mentioned with the equal high

3310
02:11:34,400 --> 02:11:36,639
that or or at least with the highs that

3311
02:11:36,639 --> 02:11:39,199
don't necessarily take the high that

3312
02:11:39,199 --> 02:11:40,719
it's going to run

3313
02:11:40,719 --> 02:11:42,560
it comes close to it

3314
02:11:42,560 --> 02:11:46,000
inches up and then trades away

3315
02:11:46,000 --> 02:11:47,679
because you have a lot of traders that

3316
02:11:47,679 --> 02:11:49,760
see these candles pushing up and they're

3317
02:11:49,760 --> 02:11:52,239
like oh that's a great time to get in

3318
02:11:52,239 --> 02:11:55,199
wow let me jump into this

3319
02:11:55,199 --> 02:11:57,040
and what happened

3320
02:11:57,040 --> 02:12:00,320
there they're stopped out

3321
02:12:01,920 --> 02:12:04,320
yeah they stopped out

3322
02:12:04,320 --> 02:12:06,639
so you want to pay attention to to these

3323
02:12:06,639 --> 02:12:08,719
equal highs that happen because

3324
02:12:08,719 --> 02:12:10,320
oftentimes

3325
02:12:10,320 --> 02:12:12,079
you know

3326
02:12:12,079 --> 02:12:14,400
like i said you have a huge push away

3327
02:12:14,400 --> 02:12:16,639
from that area so you don't want to

3328
02:12:16,639 --> 02:12:17,679
chase it

3329
02:12:17,679 --> 02:12:20,639
and then you end up with like this three

3330
02:12:20,639 --> 02:12:22,639
candles pushing up go directly to the

3331
02:12:22,639 --> 02:12:24,320
area come back down

3332
02:12:24,320 --> 02:12:25,199
and

3333
02:12:25,199 --> 02:12:28,639
this one candle here is like 20 pips

3334
02:12:28,639 --> 02:12:32,400
inside of it 22 pips in this one candle

3335
02:12:32,400 --> 02:12:34,800
so you jumped in trying to chase on this

3336
02:12:34,800 --> 02:12:38,320
and it pulled you all the way back

3337
02:12:38,800 --> 02:12:41,520
which could potentially pull you further

3338
02:12:41,520 --> 02:12:44,719
back to maybe even the the area that we

3339
02:12:44,719 --> 02:12:48,440
discussed here

3340
02:12:50,320 --> 02:12:51,440
and then you

3341
02:12:51,440 --> 02:12:53,840
take the l because you realize that it's

3342
02:12:53,840 --> 02:12:56,480
a possibility of it not coming back or

3343
02:12:56,480 --> 02:12:59,599
you over leveraged

3344
02:12:59,840 --> 02:13:02,639
and now you have to hedge in a cell

3345
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:04,560
while you're in this buy and you don't

3346
02:13:04,560 --> 02:13:07,920
know where this cell is going

3347
02:13:08,159 --> 02:13:09,360
meanwhile you don't even know where the

3348
02:13:09,360 --> 02:13:12,079
buy is going either

3349
02:13:12,079 --> 02:13:13,840
so you don't want to chase these because

3350
02:13:13,840 --> 02:13:15,599
then you end up in those predicaments

3351
02:13:15,599 --> 02:13:17,040
where

3352
02:13:17,040 --> 02:13:19,040
you know now you you have to cut your

3353
02:13:19,040 --> 02:13:21,360
loss you're unaware of it if it's going

3354
02:13:21,360 --> 02:13:22,560
to come back

3355
02:13:22,560 --> 02:13:24,639
and if it does come back

3356
02:13:24,639 --> 02:13:26,320
you might have been in a cell just

3357
02:13:26,320 --> 02:13:30,599
trying to stop the bleed

3358
02:13:31,360 --> 02:13:33,199
you know so you you just you just want

3359
02:13:33,199 --> 02:13:35,280
to be mindful of that and

3360
02:13:35,280 --> 02:13:37,119
that would help with your trading go

3361
02:13:37,119 --> 02:13:38,880
through my earn and learn series i'm

3362
02:13:38,880 --> 02:13:40,239
probably going to add this into the earn

3363
02:13:40,239 --> 02:13:42,079
and learn series as well but go through

3364
02:13:42,079 --> 02:13:43,920
the earn and learn series there's so

3365

aren't you charging for this this is

3370
02:13:53,199 --> 02:13:54,560
great information

3371
02:13:54,560 --> 02:13:56,159
for people to learn and actually trade

3372
02:13:56,159 --> 02:13:58,880
from no because it's it's free i make my

3373
02:13:58,880 --> 02:14:00,480
own money

3374
02:14:00,480 --> 02:14:04,079
trading that's my job to trade

3375
02:14:04,079 --> 02:14:06,239
but i love i'm very passionate about

3376
02:14:06,239 --> 02:14:08,560
teaching and i'm very passionate about

3377
02:14:08,560 --> 02:14:11,119
helping people understand things that

3378
02:14:11,119 --> 02:14:13,599
they may not necessarily be able to

3379
02:14:13,599 --> 02:14:16,159
grasp without somebody helping them and

3380
02:14:16,159 --> 02:14:18,639
why is it that you know everything needs

3381
02:14:18,639 --> 02:14:20,639
to be a charge we're in a recession or

3382
02:14:20,639 --> 02:14:22,320
we're heading into one it's gonna get

3383
02:14:22,320 --> 02:14:24,639
worse

3384
02:14:24,880 --> 02:14:26,880
you're taking people money so you could

3385
02:14:26,880 --> 02:14:28,639
make money on top of the money you

3386
02:14:28,639 --> 02:14:30,639
already make

3387
02:14:30,639 --> 02:14:32,159
doing trading

3388
02:14:32,159 --> 02:14:33,840
unless most of your time is going

3389
02:14:33,840 --> 02:14:35,599
towards actually

3390
02:14:35,599 --> 02:14:38,000
helping people consulting people then i

3391
02:14:38,000 --> 02:14:39,679
could understand where

3392
02:14:39,679 --> 02:14:40,800
the

3393
02:14:40,800 --> 02:14:44,079
you know the charge is coming from

3394
02:14:44,079 --> 02:14:45,760
but i could come on and do this any time

3395
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:47,520
of the day i could have insomnia i can't

3396
02:14:47,520 --> 02:14:49,599
sleep and i can get up and trade and

3397
02:14:49,599 --> 02:14:51,840
make money and be profitable you you

3398
02:14:51,840 --> 02:14:55,599
guys see all of this coming out go into

3399
02:14:55,599 --> 02:14:58,000
any youtubers channel search their name

3400
02:14:58,000 --> 02:14:59,840
raja banks uh

3401
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,440
control fx

3402
02:15:01,440 --> 02:15:03,679
uh champion pips all these different

3403
02:15:03,679 --> 02:15:05,520
people which i'm not saying that they're

3404
02:15:05,520 --> 02:15:07,440
bad traders and i'm not speaking bad

3405
02:15:07,440 --> 02:15:10,639
about them but i'm saying go into

3406
02:15:10,639 --> 02:15:13,199
their streams look at how many trades

3407
02:15:13,199 --> 02:15:15,119
they take a day

3408
02:15:15,119 --> 02:15:17,440
that might be sufficient to take one

3409
02:15:17,440 --> 02:15:19,040
trade for them

3410
02:15:19,040 --> 02:15:20,880
but for me

3411
02:15:20,880 --> 02:15:22,880
since i trade on one minute and since i

3412
02:15:22,880 --> 02:15:25,520
have such precision with with the skills

3413
02:15:25,520 --> 02:15:27,440
that i've developed

3414
02:15:27,440 --> 02:15:29,599
i'm like hey why not just

3415
02:15:29,599 --> 02:15:31,360
you know trade any time of the day take

3416
02:15:31,360 --> 02:15:33,679
any amount of trades that i want to take

3417
02:15:33,679 --> 02:15:35,440
you know like people like don't over

3418
02:15:35,440 --> 02:15:37,040
trade don't have

3419
02:15:37,040 --> 02:15:39,199
don't because if you over trade what's

3420
02:15:39,199 --> 02:15:41,119
going to end up like all of that please

3421
02:15:41,119 --> 02:15:43,199
cut it out leave me alone like

3422
02:15:43,199 --> 02:15:44,239
just

3423
02:15:44,239 --> 02:15:46,400
i i don't care about that

3424
02:15:46,400 --> 02:15:47,360
at all

3425
02:15:47,360 --> 02:15:49,199
because skill is skill regardless of

3426
02:15:49,199 --> 02:15:51,040
what environment you're in

3427
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:52,639
that's why when when

3428
02:15:52,639 --> 02:15:55,760
gifted children are taking exams

3429
02:15:55,760 --> 02:15:58,639
for for giftedness watch this candle

3430
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:00,800
here um because it just wicked below the

3431
02:16:00,800 --> 02:16:03,040
candle to the left and could possibly

3432
02:16:03,040 --> 02:16:04,960
start to pull to the upside from here

3433
02:16:04,960 --> 02:16:06,639
but with gifted kids when they take

3434
02:16:06,639 --> 02:16:09,440
exams they take them to even in

3435
02:16:09,440 --> 02:16:11,119
kindergarten they take them to an

3436
02:16:11,119 --> 02:16:13,520
entirely different school with

3437
02:16:13,520 --> 02:16:14,960
different staff

3438
02:16:14,960 --> 02:16:16,000
and

3439
02:16:16,000 --> 02:16:18,560
nobody that they know

3440
02:16:18,560 --> 02:16:22,239
and when they when they take that exam

3441
02:16:22,239 --> 02:16:23,840
they're in in an environment that's

3442
02:16:23,840 --> 02:16:26,880
completely unfamiliar to them

3443
02:16:26,880 --> 02:16:27,679
and

3444
02:16:27,679 --> 02:16:29,760
why do they do that because when you're

3445
02:16:29,760 --> 02:16:30,960
gifted

3446
02:16:30,960 --> 02:16:33,519
it should show in every single

3447
02:16:33,519 --> 02:16:36,478
environment that you're in

3448
02:16:36,478 --> 02:16:38,558
your given it your giftedness

3449
02:16:38,558 --> 02:16:42,558
should show in every environment that

3450
02:16:42,558 --> 02:16:44,638
you find yourself in

3451
02:16:44,638 --> 02:16:47,040
every single environment and i think

3452
02:16:47,040 --> 02:16:49,040
that this is possibly going to shift

3453
02:16:49,040 --> 02:16:51,280
down from here because this might be a

3454
02:16:51,280 --> 02:16:52,638
wike off

3455
02:16:52,638 --> 02:16:53,920
um

3456
02:16:53,920 --> 02:16:56,240
up here so you could have a shift

3457
02:16:56,240 --> 02:16:58,718
further down into

3458
02:16:58,718 --> 02:17:00,959
this area here

3459
02:17:00,959 --> 02:17:03,280
there's a possibility just because this

3460
02:17:03,280 --> 02:17:05,439
looks like distribution right here this

3461
02:17:05,439 --> 02:17:07,760
is a distribution schematic so if you

3462
02:17:07,760 --> 02:17:09,920
were still in this trade

3463
02:17:09,920 --> 02:17:11,760
there's a possibility that you can take

3464
02:17:11,760 --> 02:17:14,240
it to

3465
02:17:14,240 --> 02:17:16,240
you know these areas this being the

3466
02:17:16,240 --> 02:17:18,160
first area here because this was an area

3467
02:17:18,160 --> 02:17:20,398
that wasn't tapped in to

3468
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:22,240
remember i mentioned that that we might

3469
02:17:22,240 --> 02:17:23,200
have

3470
02:17:23,200 --> 02:17:25,280
the trade come into this area and then

3471
02:17:25,280 --> 02:17:27,359
leave it there's a possibility that it

3472
02:17:27,359 --> 02:17:28,558
can

3473
02:17:28,558 --> 02:17:30,478
again these lines that i use they're

3474
02:17:30,478 --> 02:17:32,398
just essentially

3475
02:17:32,398 --> 02:17:34,240
you know giving me some guide to what

3476
02:17:34,240 --> 02:17:35,679
price can do

3477
02:17:35,679 --> 02:17:37,679
but price doesn't necessarily have to do

3478
02:17:37,679 --> 02:17:38,558
that

3479
02:17:38,558 --> 02:17:40,558
price can do

3480
02:17:40,558 --> 02:17:42,718
something else

3481
02:17:42,718 --> 02:17:45,200
what we want to know is

3482
02:17:45,200 --> 02:17:46,638
we want to see

3483
02:17:46,638 --> 02:17:48,638
bullish behavior remember we discussed

3484
02:17:48,638 --> 02:17:49,439
that

3485
02:17:49,439 --> 02:17:52,080
we want to see bullish behavior

3486
02:17:52,080 --> 02:17:54,240
happening down here

3487
02:17:54,240 --> 02:17:57,760
to get some idea or some indication

3488
02:17:57,760 --> 02:18:00,558
that we should get out of a trade

3489
02:18:00,558 --> 02:18:03,120
so look at this 10 pips

3490
02:18:03,120 --> 02:18:05,200
for 96

3491
02:18:05,200 --> 02:18:08,160
taps right into our area

3492
02:18:08,160 --> 02:18:10,959
that we were looking to short from

3493
02:18:10,959 --> 02:18:13,519
up here now we did mention this area

3494
02:18:13,519 --> 02:18:16,000
here too but did we see any bullish

3495
02:18:16,000 --> 02:18:17,280
behavior here

3496
02:18:17,280 --> 02:18:18,160
no

3497
02:18:18,160 --> 02:18:19,439
we didn't

3498
02:18:19,439 --> 02:18:22,160
so if we don't see bullish behavior

3499
02:18:22,160 --> 02:18:25,519
we're not looking to get out of a trade

3500
02:18:25,519 --> 02:18:28,080
you can take it and close here and and

3501
02:18:28,080 --> 02:18:29,439
maybe a

3502
02:18:29,439 --> 02:18:30,478
partial

3503
02:18:30,478 --> 02:18:32,240
and now you have runners heading down or

3504
02:18:32,240 --> 02:18:34,558
you can just continue to hold if you

3505
02:18:34,558 --> 02:18:37,120
understand what price is doing but as i

3506
02:18:37,120 --> 02:18:38,558
just mentioned i said this looks like

3507
02:18:38,558 --> 02:18:40,478
distribution up here so this could

3508
02:18:40,478 --> 02:18:43,200
potentially take us further down

3509
02:18:43,200 --> 02:18:45,760
the first area being here which this

3510
02:18:45,760 --> 02:18:47,359
bullish i mean sorry this bearish

3511
02:18:47,359 --> 02:18:48,799
engulfing candle coming through this

3512
02:18:48,799 --> 02:18:51,040
area is not a good sign at all

3513
02:18:51,040 --> 02:18:52,959
like i would

3514
02:18:52,959 --> 02:18:55,120
not even have any hopes

3515
02:18:55,120 --> 02:18:56,000
for

3516
02:18:56,000 --> 02:18:59,120
price coming up from this area

3517
02:18:59,120 --> 02:19:01,200
to target the highs

3518
02:19:01,200 --> 02:19:04,478
because this candle pushed directly

3519
02:19:04,478 --> 02:19:05,519
through

3520
02:19:05,519 --> 02:19:08,240
the supply area that's here yeah it

3521
02:19:08,240 --> 02:19:09,920
tapped into this one

3522
02:19:09,920 --> 02:19:12,799
but it could tap into this one here

3523
02:19:12,799 --> 02:19:15,519
to take us back up here to take us back

3524
02:19:15,519 --> 02:19:17,679
down here

3525
02:19:17,679 --> 02:19:20,478
and when you understand that when when

3526
02:19:20,478 --> 02:19:23,040
you have rules that that shows you that

3527
02:19:23,040 --> 02:19:24,799
i know all of this seems crazy to like

3528
02:19:24,799 --> 02:19:26,478
somebody that might have just came on or

3529
02:19:26,478 --> 02:19:28,478
something but when you have

3530
02:19:28,478 --> 02:19:30,959
the rules to this

3531
02:19:30,959 --> 02:19:36,240
then now you begin to get some idea of

3532
02:19:36,240 --> 02:19:38,240
how you could trade this and what do i

3533
02:19:38,240 --> 02:19:40,240
mean by rules remember we said that if

3534
02:19:40,240 --> 02:19:42,160
this low was ran

3535
02:19:42,160 --> 02:19:43,840
this low here

3536
02:19:43,840 --> 02:19:45,920
we had this candle in the beginning if

3537
02:19:45,920 --> 02:19:48,160
this low is ran

3538
02:19:48,160 --> 02:19:50,560
which we had the run of this low here

3539
02:19:50,560 --> 02:19:53,680
we could potentially be shifting down

3540
02:19:53,680 --> 02:19:56,399
but after we ran this low what did we

3541
02:19:56,399 --> 02:19:59,280
have a push up

3542
02:19:59,280 --> 02:20:02,080
and we made a higher high now according

3543
02:20:02,080 --> 02:20:03,920
to institutional structure this low is

3544
02:20:03,920 --> 02:20:05,439
the protected low

3545
02:20:05,439 --> 02:20:06,800
but this low

3546
02:20:06,800 --> 02:20:08,160
signifies

3547
02:20:08,160 --> 02:20:10,720
some sort of trend reversal for me or

3548
02:20:10,720 --> 02:20:13,120
some sort of trend change intermediary

3549
02:20:13,120 --> 02:20:14,720
trend change

3550
02:20:14,720 --> 02:20:18,240
not necessarily overall trend change

3551
02:20:18,240 --> 02:20:19,680
because this may be

3552
02:20:19,680 --> 02:20:22,000
institutional structure on

3553
02:20:22,000 --> 02:20:25,200
a higher time frame here here

3554
02:20:25,200 --> 02:20:27,840
here this is the last low here so you

3555
02:20:27,840 --> 02:20:30,240
have this low this high this low and

3556
02:20:30,240 --> 02:20:32,399
then this high that was put in

3557
02:20:32,399 --> 02:20:35,840
so now if we run this low

3558
02:20:35,840 --> 02:20:38,399
which that's what we're doing now

3559
02:20:38,399 --> 02:20:40,880
now that could mean that institutional

3560
02:20:40,880 --> 02:20:42,160
structure

3561
02:20:42,160 --> 02:20:44,000
is shifting

3562
02:20:44,000 --> 02:20:46,880
the larger time frame structure

3563
02:20:46,880 --> 02:20:48,399
is shifting

3564
02:20:48,399 --> 02:20:50,160
and what you could have

3565
02:20:50,160 --> 02:20:52,560
is that price trades up here shifts

3566
02:20:52,560 --> 02:20:53,680
below

3567
02:20:53,680 --> 02:20:55,439
and then

3568
02:20:55,439 --> 02:20:57,359
after it shifts below we get a

3569
02:20:57,359 --> 02:21:01,600
retracement back into this area here

3570
02:21:01,600 --> 02:21:02,960
and then

3571
02:21:02,960 --> 02:21:04,640
we get a short

3572
02:21:04,640 --> 02:21:05,760
to

3573
02:21:05,760 --> 02:21:08,640
run some of these lows

3574
02:21:08,640 --> 02:21:11,600
maybe this being the first low ran

3575
02:21:11,600 --> 02:21:14,800
we get a short here

3576
02:21:14,800 --> 02:21:16,720
but where could we possibly short to we

3577
02:21:16,720 --> 02:21:19,439
could run this low immediately touch

3578
02:21:19,439 --> 02:21:22,319
this line and then immediately push back

3579
02:21:22,319 --> 02:21:23,760
up

3580
02:21:23,760 --> 02:21:26,560
if you don't get a candle closure

3581
02:21:26,560 --> 02:21:28,399
below the low

3582
02:21:28,399 --> 02:21:32,000
then it's not a break of structure

3583
02:21:32,000 --> 02:21:35,359
i don't consider it a breakup structure

3584
02:21:35,359 --> 02:21:38,080
the candle needs to close below it to be

3585
02:21:38,080 --> 02:21:40,560
considered a breakup structure because

3586
02:21:40,560 --> 02:21:44,720
that's how you avoid less fake outs

3587
02:21:44,800 --> 02:21:46,399
so

3588
02:21:46,399 --> 02:21:48,560
you know as i mentioned i said that this

3589
02:21:48,560 --> 02:21:49,760
would

3590
02:21:49,760 --> 02:21:52,000
if this ran this like this with this

3591
02:21:52,000 --> 02:21:54,560
bearish engulfing candle you know that

3592
02:21:54,560 --> 02:21:56,720
price is going to continue to go through

3593
02:21:56,720 --> 02:21:58,160
the area

3594
02:21:58,160 --> 02:22:00,319
and what do we have we had a run all the

3595
02:22:00,319 --> 02:22:03,280
way into this area here

3596
02:22:03,280 --> 02:22:06,640
and we could potentially get a run of

3597
02:22:06,640 --> 02:22:07,760
the low

3598
02:22:07,760 --> 02:22:08,800
again

3599
02:22:08,800 --> 02:22:11,600
this is a wick that ran this low

3600
02:22:11,600 --> 02:22:14,399
like i said i need a body to close down

3601
02:22:14,399 --> 02:22:16,720
here and not a body to just close like

3602
02:22:16,720 --> 02:22:19,920
you know just over it i need a body to

3603
02:22:19,920 --> 02:22:22,319
close like further down like somewhere

3604
02:22:22,319 --> 02:22:23,760
in this area

3605
02:22:23,760 --> 02:22:25,760
if i get a body closure

3606
02:22:25,760 --> 02:22:29,120
then that's a break of structure for me

3607
02:22:29,120 --> 02:22:31,040
and

3608
02:22:31,040 --> 02:22:34,319
then price is reversing to go short

3609
02:22:34,319 --> 02:22:35,120
but

3610
02:22:35,120 --> 02:22:37,920
if price doesn't come back to this area

3611
02:22:37,920 --> 02:22:39,680
and break the low

3612
02:22:39,680 --> 02:22:42,399
i'm not expecting it to come short down

3613
02:22:42,399 --> 02:22:46,720
here i'm expecting it to continue long

3614
02:22:46,720 --> 02:22:48,319
and that's how you

3615
02:22:48,319 --> 02:22:49,439
you um

3616
02:22:49,439 --> 02:22:51,280
you know set up your rules

3617
02:22:51,280 --> 02:22:53,359
uh do you trade with real money right

3618
02:22:53,359 --> 02:22:56,880
now uh the watcher yes i i do trade um

3619
02:22:56,880 --> 02:22:59,120
with real money i don't trade prop firm

3620
02:22:59,120 --> 02:23:01,120
you know demo i'll use you know like

3621
02:23:01,120 --> 02:23:02,720
through the night if

3622
02:23:02,720 --> 02:23:04,240
if i'm just like trying to figure out

3623
02:23:04,240 --> 02:23:06,319
where something is gonna go and i want

3624
02:23:06,319 --> 02:23:08,399
some gratification for

3625
02:23:08,399 --> 02:23:11,040
for the trade actually playing out um

3626
02:23:11,040 --> 02:23:14,479
i'll use demo uh sometimes but um no i

3627
02:23:14,479 --> 02:23:17,200
only trade uh real capital

3628
02:23:17,200 --> 02:23:20,399
um if i'm not like learning

3629
02:23:20,399 --> 02:23:22,319
if i'm actually trading then it's just

3630
02:23:22,319 --> 02:23:24,399
real capital and it's my own money that

3631
02:23:24,399 --> 02:23:26,720
i'm using i'm not using um

3632
02:23:26,720 --> 02:23:29,840
a prop firm or or anything else and i

3633
02:23:29,840 --> 02:23:31,520
understand i'm not saying that it's it's

3634
02:23:31,520 --> 02:23:33,840
wrong for for um

3635
02:23:33,840 --> 02:23:36,160
you know other people to to use prop

3636
02:23:36,160 --> 02:23:37,760
firms because if you don't have access

3637
02:23:37,760 --> 02:23:40,399
to the capital then you know of course

3638
02:23:40,399 --> 02:23:43,600
is a no-brainer you can have a 200 000

3639
02:23:43,600 --> 02:23:44,479
account

3640
02:23:44,479 --> 02:23:46,560
if you are skilled enough to pass the

3641
02:23:46,560 --> 02:23:48,720
evaluation which those are nothing when

3642
02:23:48,720 --> 02:23:50,960
it comes to the way i trade here those

3643
02:23:50,960 --> 02:23:53,040
evaluations i i could probably do one in

3644
02:23:53,040 --> 02:23:55,680
the future um to show how easy they are

3645
02:23:55,680 --> 02:23:57,040
but um

3646
02:23:57,040 --> 02:23:59,520
you know you can take that

3647
02:23:59,520 --> 02:24:01,439
use that money to trade build up your

3648
02:24:01,439 --> 02:24:03,120
own account and then move forward with

3649
02:24:03,120 --> 02:24:05,439
your own account but i actually

3650
02:24:05,439 --> 02:24:07,200
started to um

3651
02:24:07,200 --> 02:24:09,680
build up my own account just using six

3652
02:24:09,680 --> 02:24:11,760
hundred dollars so i would use six

3653
02:24:11,760 --> 02:24:13,600
hundred dollars a day and i would make a

3654
02:24:13,600 --> 02:24:15,680
thousand dollars on oil just using six

3655
02:24:15,680 --> 02:24:18,160
hundred dollars and then i would move on

3656
02:24:18,160 --> 02:24:19,200
to

3657
02:24:19,200 --> 02:24:21,280
being able to like

3658
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:22,319
you know

3659
02:24:22,319 --> 02:24:24,399
make larger amounts of money throughout

3660
02:24:24,399 --> 02:24:26,319
the day build my account

3661
02:24:26,319 --> 02:24:28,640
um take some stuff out for profit but

3662
02:24:28,640 --> 02:24:32,319
then now i'm so precise and fine-tuned

3663
02:24:32,319 --> 02:24:34,240
that i don't necessarily need a large

3664
02:24:34,240 --> 02:24:36,319
amount of money in my account if i have

3665
02:24:36,319 --> 02:24:38,240
a certain set amount of money i could

3666
02:24:38,240 --> 02:24:39,040
make

3667
02:24:39,040 --> 02:24:42,000
20 30 40 000 a day if i wanted to with

3668
02:24:42,000 --> 02:24:44,880
just a smaller portion of money rather

3669
02:24:44,880 --> 02:24:46,000
than having

3670
02:24:46,000 --> 02:24:47,920
all of the money in

3671
02:24:47,920 --> 02:24:49,600
in my account

3672
02:24:49,600 --> 02:24:51,840
so uh no i don't i don't know traders

3673
02:24:51,840 --> 02:24:54,399
reality um i've never heard of it is

3674
02:24:54,399 --> 02:24:57,280
that like some type of uh group or

3675
02:24:57,280 --> 02:25:00,640
something like that i'm not too sure

3676
02:25:00,640 --> 02:25:02,560
let me see if i could uh find them on

3677
02:25:02,560 --> 02:25:05,560

3681
02:25:20,560 --> 02:25:23,560
off

3682
02:25:25,040 --> 02:25:28,800

let's uh

3684
02:25:31,359 --> 02:25:34,880
oh what happened here

sorry about that

3686
02:25:40,080 --> 02:25:41,760
so here he is

3687
02:25:41,760 --> 02:25:44,080
uh traitor's reality

3688
02:25:44,080 --> 02:25:46,319
let me just

3689
02:25:46,319 --> 02:25:49,520
take a look at this

3690
02:25:49,680 --> 02:25:52,560
um does he have any live trading let me

3691
02:25:52,560 --> 02:25:54,720
just

3692
02:25:55,840 --> 02:25:59,280
any live streams maybe

3693
02:25:59,280 --> 02:26:02,560
okay yeah he does

3694
02:26:03,280 --> 02:26:05,040
reversal i just

3695
02:26:05,040 --> 02:26:07,840
i mean so sorry about that guys i didn't

3696
02:26:07,840 --> 02:26:09,280
know that

3697
02:26:09,280 --> 02:26:11,120
the sound would

3698
02:26:11,120 --> 02:26:12,880
be like that let me just turn it up a

3699
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:15,120
little

3700
02:26:19,040 --> 02:26:21,200
guys then we bit start looking towards

3701
02:26:21,200 --> 02:26:22,640
these previous vector zones that we've

3702
02:26:22,640 --> 02:26:24,479
been talking about in the streams over

3703
02:26:24,479 --> 02:26:26,880
the past few days okay

3704
02:26:26,880 --> 02:26:29,120
this is the last point for bitcoin to

3705
02:26:29,120 --> 02:26:30,399
show its worth

3706
02:26:30,399 --> 02:26:33,120
can bitcoin hold this point and i hope

3707
02:26:33,120 --> 02:26:34,640
it can ladies and gentlemen because

3708
02:26:34,640 --> 02:26:38,840
we've had too much blood on the streets

3709
02:26:51,680 --> 02:26:54,240
yeah he he has some um

3710
02:26:54,240 --> 02:26:55,840
pretty good analysis from what i'm

3711
02:26:55,840 --> 02:26:57,600
seeing here he is utilizing the

3712
02:26:57,600 --> 02:26:59,760
imbalance which you know i use at times

3713
02:26:59,760 --> 02:27:02,479
too i see him using a little volume um

3714
02:27:02,479 --> 02:27:05,280
actually with bitcoin he's on the daily

3715
02:27:05,280 --> 02:27:06,319
so

3716
02:27:06,319 --> 02:27:06,730
um

3717
02:27:06,730 --> 02:27:08,560
[Music]

3718
02:27:08,560 --> 02:27:11,120
let me actually go there

3719
02:27:11,120 --> 02:27:12,640
uh

3720
02:27:12,640 --> 02:27:14,880
so yeah it looks like

3721
02:27:14,880 --> 02:27:18,000
uh with coinbase this came down to 25

3722
02:27:18,000 --> 02:27:20,399
000. i did have it coming to this area

3723
02:27:20,399 --> 02:27:21,760
right here

3724
02:27:21,760 --> 02:27:23,760
you see this area i had it just

3725
02:27:23,760 --> 02:27:25,840
mitigating the area and maybe giving us

3726
02:27:25,840 --> 02:27:29,040
a balance to the upside this was clearly

3727
02:27:29,040 --> 02:27:31,439
a manipulation

3728
02:27:31,439 --> 02:27:34,000
you know with this like there's no way

3729
02:27:34,000 --> 02:27:36,000
you look at anywhere on the map and it

3730
02:27:36,000 --> 02:27:38,160
happens at the like the most high

3731
02:27:38,160 --> 02:27:39,359
profile

3732
02:27:39,359 --> 02:27:41,120
uh moments

3733
02:27:41,120 --> 02:27:45,200
um within some of this price movement so

3734
02:27:45,200 --> 02:27:46,880
this here

3735
02:27:46,880 --> 02:27:48,160
like there was

3736
02:27:48,160 --> 02:27:49,840
absolutely

3737
02:27:49,840 --> 02:27:52,160
nothing really in the market

3738
02:27:52,160 --> 02:27:54,399
like anything globally that should have

3739
02:27:54,399 --> 02:27:56,160
shifted price

3740
02:27:56,160 --> 02:27:58,960
um this way this is

3741
02:27:58,960 --> 02:28:00,960
i didn't expect this to happen but now i

3742
02:28:00,960 --> 02:28:03,840
do have it to where if it runs

3743
02:28:03,840 --> 02:28:06,640
um this high here then we can get a

3744
02:28:06,640 --> 02:28:08,880
retracement back into this area and then

3745
02:28:08,880 --> 02:28:10,640
we can go along

3746
02:28:10,640 --> 02:28:11,840
so

3747
02:28:11,840 --> 02:28:13,840
he's right about this area holding this

3748
02:28:13,840 --> 02:28:15,760
area would need to hold give us a

3749
02:28:15,760 --> 02:28:17,680
bullish flip and then take us further up

3750
02:28:17,680 --> 02:28:19,439
but it could just come back into this

3751
02:28:19,439 --> 02:28:20,720
area here

3752
02:28:20,720 --> 02:28:25,439
um into the 39 area and possibly

3753
02:28:25,439 --> 02:28:27,600
uh

3754
02:28:27,600 --> 02:28:31,359
here to the 45 area

3755
02:28:31,359 --> 02:28:35,040
so these are two areas the the 39 and

3756
02:28:35,040 --> 02:28:38,160
the 45 46 area

3757
02:28:38,160 --> 02:28:41,280
bitcoin could possibly bounce back up to

3758
02:28:41,280 --> 02:28:43,840
have a huge push-up and then a

3759
02:28:43,840 --> 02:28:45,760
continuation down

3760
02:28:45,760 --> 02:28:47,200
so if there's anybody that got in at

3761
02:28:47,200 --> 02:28:49,120
these areas or maybe these areas up here

3762
02:28:49,120 --> 02:28:50,800
it'd be back to break even but if

3763
02:28:50,800 --> 02:28:52,720
anybody bought down here they could sell

3764
02:28:52,720 --> 02:28:54,800
out you know kind of like up here or

3765
02:28:54,800 --> 02:28:58,399
maybe up here but yeah i'm gonna um

3766
02:28:58,399 --> 02:29:00,560
definitely look into that guy

3767
02:29:00,560 --> 02:29:02,479
you know just to

3768
02:29:02,479 --> 02:29:04,000
like learn a little bit more about him

3769
02:29:04,000 --> 02:29:05,600
because a lot of the streamers i tend to

3770
02:29:05,600 --> 02:29:07,359
watch a lot of them

3771
02:29:07,359 --> 02:29:09,920
and when i watch them

3772
02:29:09,920 --> 02:29:12,560
you know i kind of get an idea of what

3773
02:29:12,560 --> 02:29:14,800
the retail space is learning what people

3774
02:29:14,800 --> 02:29:16,479
are learning on trading and i try to

3775
02:29:16,479 --> 02:29:17,520
like

3776
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:18,399
you know

3777
02:29:18,399 --> 02:29:21,600
shape those into better methods to trade

3778
02:29:21,600 --> 02:29:23,280
in like when i always talk about the

3779
02:29:23,280 --> 02:29:25,120
head and shoulders and all those double

3780
02:29:25,120 --> 02:29:26,399
bottoms those different patterns that

3781
02:29:26,399 --> 02:29:27,840
people trade

3782
02:29:27,840 --> 02:29:30,640
i can show you how to trade them

3783
02:29:30,640 --> 02:29:33,120
using better technicals

3784
02:29:33,120 --> 02:29:34,840
rather than just the shapes of the

3785
02:29:34,840 --> 02:29:37,120
pattern so um

3786
02:29:37,120 --> 02:29:39,600
you have mentioned luna

3787
02:29:39,600 --> 02:29:40,720
um

3788
02:29:40,720 --> 02:29:45,080
i'm guessing it's luna usd

3789
02:29:45,600 --> 02:29:48,640
damn luna went to hell

3790
02:29:48,640 --> 02:29:50,479
is this really in the negative let me

3791
02:29:50,479 --> 02:29:53,040
check another

3792
02:29:53,840 --> 02:29:56,640
chart maybe

3793
02:29:58,160 --> 02:30:00,880
whoa what the

3794
02:30:01,280 --> 02:30:02,960
yeah

3795
02:30:02,960 --> 02:30:04,960
i was actually gonna buy some luna up

3796
02:30:04,960 --> 02:30:08,479
here when i was like in the 70s

3797
02:30:08,479 --> 02:30:12,560
yo this is crazy

3798
02:30:13,040 --> 02:30:16,160
what a fall oh my gosh

3799
02:30:16,160 --> 02:30:18,160
see this is why you manage your wrist

3800
02:30:18,160 --> 02:30:21,040
though have those stop losses i'm sure

3801
02:30:21,040 --> 02:30:23,600
this probably happened real quick let me

3802
02:30:23,600 --> 02:30:26,880
go down to um the one minute time frame

3803
02:30:26,880 --> 02:30:28,000
and

3804
02:30:28,000 --> 02:30:30,160
oh we we do have so we do have a pop to

3805
02:30:30,160 --> 02:30:32,479
the upside okay that's this not looking

3806
02:30:32,479 --> 02:30:35,520
so bad but it looks worse than the fall

3807
02:30:35,520 --> 02:30:38,080
look at this

3808
02:30:40,000 --> 02:30:41,440
and mind you this is um

3809
02:30:41,440 --> 02:30:42,640
[Music]

3810
02:30:42,640 --> 02:30:46,880
this is one minute candles you know

3811
02:30:46,880 --> 02:30:48,560
wow

3812
02:30:48,560 --> 02:30:50,960
because look at how large they are

3813
02:30:50,960 --> 02:30:53,680
in the dissension

3814
02:30:53,680 --> 02:30:56,080
and then in the area that it finally

3815
02:30:56,080 --> 02:30:58,319
found support at i guess i could call

3816
02:30:58,319 --> 02:31:00,800
the support you know just

3817
02:31:00,800 --> 02:31:06,319
yeah this this is oh no this oh yikes oh

3818
02:31:06,319 --> 02:31:08,240
my gosh

3819
02:31:08,240 --> 02:31:11,120
any bag holders that were here you know

3820
02:31:11,120 --> 02:31:12,640
like

3821
02:31:12,640 --> 02:31:14,720
i'm i'm just

3822
02:31:14,720 --> 02:31:17,840
i want to say a prayer for you

3823
02:31:17,840 --> 02:31:20,080

02:31:20,080 --> 02:31:21,920
i hope that god comforts your heart

3825
02:31:21,920 --> 02:31:23,840
because it's never coming back up here

3826
02:31:23,840 --> 02:31:26,319
again i can tell you that much

3827
02:31:26,319 --> 02:31:28,240
you might as well just get out of that

3828
02:31:28,240 --> 02:31:30,080
when when these happen

3829
02:31:30,080 --> 02:31:31,760
you know in in a lot of different

3830
02:31:31,760 --> 02:31:32,960
instruments

3831
02:31:32,960 --> 02:31:35,680
you will never

3832
02:31:35,680 --> 02:31:39,359
see the return of this again never like

3833
02:31:39,359 --> 02:31:40,640
this

3834
02:31:40,640 --> 02:31:43,520
for for all of existence

3835
02:31:43,520 --> 02:31:45,920
luna is never

3836
02:31:45,920 --> 02:31:48,560
returning to this market

3837
02:31:48,560 --> 02:31:51,120
ever again like

3838
02:31:51,120 --> 02:31:52,319
no

3839
02:31:52,319 --> 02:31:54,080
no

3840
02:31:54,080 --> 02:31:56,880
yeah it's over uh if you have any luna

3841
02:31:56,880 --> 02:31:59,040
and it's this in profit

3842
02:31:59,040 --> 02:32:00,560
you'll get rid of it if you want to day

3843
02:32:00,560 --> 02:32:03,280
trade it you can i will say that um let

3844
02:32:03,280 --> 02:32:04,800
me go to

3845
02:32:04,800 --> 02:32:06,319
yeah if you want to day trade this you

3846
02:32:06,319 --> 02:32:08,160
you can you know day trade it if you

3847
02:32:08,160 --> 02:32:09,600
want to

3848
02:32:09,600 --> 02:32:11,520
but it's

3849
02:32:11,520 --> 02:32:13,359
it's not looking

3850
02:32:13,359 --> 02:32:15,520
the best right now

3851
02:32:15,520 --> 02:32:17,600
you know like you

3852
02:32:17,600 --> 02:32:19,680
you could have a possible

3853
02:32:19,680 --> 02:32:20,560
uh

3854
02:32:20,560 --> 02:32:22,800
dip into this area

3855
02:32:22,800 --> 02:32:26,240
and then get like a little bounce up

3856
02:32:26,240 --> 02:32:30,800
you know or a possible dip into

3857
02:32:30,800 --> 02:32:32,800
this area because price didn't return

3858
02:32:32,800 --> 02:32:35,920
there after it flipped

3859
02:32:36,479 --> 02:32:39,840
and then possibly have like a

3860
02:32:40,319 --> 02:32:42,800
sorry about that a stronger bounce up

3861
02:32:42,800 --> 02:32:44,960
um to here if you were to trade this

3862
02:32:44,960 --> 02:32:48,160
using you know the one minute um

3863
02:32:48,160 --> 02:32:50,080
that's a possibility

3864
02:32:50,080 --> 02:32:53,439
um i would probably wait for it to

3865
02:32:53,439 --> 02:32:56,000
let's see

3866
02:32:58,880 --> 02:33:01,600
pushed up ran the high

3867
02:33:01,600 --> 02:33:05,520
came back into the area

3868
02:33:05,520 --> 02:33:08,560
so this ran

3869
02:33:09,520 --> 02:33:13,200
yeah back into this area you have this

3870
02:33:13,200 --> 02:33:15,600
short

3871
02:33:16,240 --> 02:33:18,880
that engaged from here see this stop is

3872
02:33:18,880 --> 02:33:21,520
too high though this is this is the stop

3873
02:33:21,520 --> 02:33:23,760
loss is way too high

3874
02:33:23,760 --> 02:33:26,800
and and then possibly like

3875
02:33:26,800 --> 02:33:29,040
targets somewhere out of the area maybe

3876
02:33:29,040 --> 02:33:31,920
this this structural low here

3877
02:33:31,920 --> 02:33:35,680
um you could potentially have that ran

3878
02:33:35,680 --> 02:33:38,160
because this was the low that

3879
02:33:38,160 --> 02:33:39,760
took out the load to the left that's a

3880
02:33:39,760 --> 02:33:41,520
possibility but

3881
02:33:41,520 --> 02:33:43,280
you know other than that there's there's

3882
02:33:43,280 --> 02:33:44,640
no way

3883
02:33:44,640 --> 02:33:46,960
i'm not that's coming back yeah 6

3884
02:33:46,960 --> 02:33:49,520
trillion is the supply yeah that's

3885
02:33:49,520 --> 02:33:52,160
that's way too much

3886
02:33:52,160 --> 02:33:54,000
unless they were looking for for it to

3887
02:33:54,000 --> 02:33:56,960
be a currency that they were adopting

3888
02:33:56,960 --> 02:33:57,680
to

3889
02:33:57,680 --> 02:34:00,640
to use in a specific car a specific

3890
02:34:00,640 --> 02:34:03,200
country and that country

3891
02:34:03,200 --> 02:34:04,319
you know

3892
02:34:04,319 --> 02:34:07,280
was was using it as a legal tender or

3893
02:34:07,280 --> 02:34:09,680
the other way that they could have

3894
02:34:09,680 --> 02:34:12,000
utilized this was that

3895
02:34:12,000 --> 02:34:14,640
they could have used this for a banking

3896
02:34:14,640 --> 02:34:16,560
infrastructure network like the u.s

3897
02:34:16,560 --> 02:34:18,080
federal reserve

3898
02:34:18,080 --> 02:34:20,000
to be able to

3899
02:34:20,000 --> 02:34:22,160
run most of the money that they have in

3900
02:34:22,160 --> 02:34:25,439
circulation electronically so

3901
02:34:25,439 --> 02:34:27,280
that would have been a way but yeah

3902
02:34:27,280 --> 02:34:29,120
that's that's way too much it lost all

3903
02:34:29,120 --> 02:34:30,880
its value over

3904
02:34:30,880 --> 02:34:34,160
um you know that excess imprinting

3905
02:34:34,160 --> 02:34:37,040
you know no function as of yet you know

3906
02:34:37,040 --> 02:34:39,439
there's a bunch of reasons as to why

3907
02:34:39,439 --> 02:34:41,439
um that

3908
02:34:41,439 --> 02:34:43,439
that happened but yeah you definitely

3909
02:34:43,439 --> 02:34:45,359
want to stay out of things that

3910
02:34:45,359 --> 02:34:47,040
that are over inflated like that that's

3911
02:34:47,040 --> 02:34:48,640
why i told people doge isn't going

3912
02:34:48,640 --> 02:34:49,600
anywhere

3913
02:34:49,600 --> 02:34:51,120
doge is going to stay

3914
02:34:51,120 --> 02:34:53,120
exactly where it's at or get worse

3915
02:34:53,120 --> 02:34:54,560
because there's no function there's no

3916
02:34:54,560 --> 02:34:56,560
utility other than what sending money to

3917
02:34:56,560 --> 02:34:58,880
someone else that they don't have to use

3918
02:34:58,880 --> 02:35:00,399
that there's so many other coins that

3919
02:35:00,399 --> 02:35:02,399
are way faster

3920
02:35:02,399 --> 02:35:03,840
than doge

3921
02:35:03,840 --> 02:35:07,439
you know so that's just something that

3922
02:35:07,439 --> 02:35:08,720
that you um

3923
02:35:08,720 --> 02:35:10,560
want to consider

3924
02:35:10,560 --> 02:35:11,359
when

3925
02:35:11,359 --> 02:35:15,120
when buying these these cryptocurrencies

3926
02:35:15,120 --> 02:35:17,280
you just want to be careful of that so

3927
02:35:17,280 --> 02:35:18,399
this could

3928
02:35:18,399 --> 02:35:20,560
this could either

3929
02:35:20,560 --> 02:35:22,479
uh go here

3930
02:35:22,479 --> 02:35:24,880
to again assume the high

3931
02:35:24,880 --> 02:35:27,520
or this can just be coming to this line

3932
02:35:27,520 --> 02:35:28,880
here

3933
02:35:28,880 --> 02:35:31,040
to

3934
02:35:31,920 --> 02:35:35,439
to continue running the lows

3935
02:35:35,439 --> 02:35:38,880
that's a potential

3936
02:35:38,960 --> 02:35:41,920
so if it does that then

3937
02:35:41,920 --> 02:35:43,600
you know you could expect

3938
02:35:43,600 --> 02:35:47,680
a bearish continuation into this area

3939
02:35:47,680 --> 02:35:49,600
yeah that's it was under a million

3940
02:35:49,600 --> 02:35:51,520
before the crash so it seems like

3941
02:35:51,520 --> 02:35:54,640
somebody you know there's a quick amount

3942
02:35:54,640 --> 02:35:56,479
of money somebody got out of that if it

3943
02:35:56,479 --> 02:35:58,960
was under a million and it printed to

3944
02:35:58,960 --> 02:36:02,479
six trillion that's that's crazy

3945
02:36:02,479 --> 02:36:03,520
but um

3946
02:36:03,520 --> 02:36:05,520
this is the end of my stream guys you

3947
02:36:05,520 --> 02:36:07,120
know always love talking with you guys

3948
02:36:07,120 --> 02:36:09,120
engaging with you guys i think i want to

3949
02:36:09,120 --> 02:36:11,920
push the stream back further than 9 30

3950
02:36:11,920 --> 02:36:14,560
because i see that a lot of people

3951
02:36:14,560 --> 02:36:16,560
they're still on throughout like you

3952
02:36:16,560 --> 02:36:18,399
know the the 10 30

3953
02:36:18,399 --> 02:36:21,200
time frame or or even 11 30 there's more

3954
02:36:21,200 --> 02:36:23,359
engagement that starts then so

3955
02:36:23,359 --> 02:36:24,960
um you know i'm thinking about moving

3956
02:36:24,960 --> 02:36:26,240
the stream back

3957
02:36:26,240 --> 02:36:28,479
for a certain time uh did i see your

3958
02:36:28,479 --> 02:36:30,479
question do you know about the lovely

3959
02:36:30,479 --> 02:36:32,800
market makers yes i do know about the

3960
02:36:32,800 --> 02:36:34,240
market makers

3961
02:36:34,240 --> 02:36:35,120
um

3962
02:36:35,120 --> 02:36:37,120
you know and the way they do things to

3963
02:36:37,120 --> 02:36:39,359
their job is to balance the market but

3964
02:36:39,359 --> 02:36:41,200
they tend to manipulate it a lot on the

3965
02:36:41,200 --> 02:36:42,479
behalf of

3966
02:36:42,479 --> 02:36:44,800
um certain clients so

3967
02:36:44,800 --> 02:36:47,040
you know i do know about them yes

3968
02:36:47,040 --> 02:36:48,160
um

3969
02:36:48,160 --> 02:36:50,560
but again uh you know i'm here every day

3970
02:36:50,560 --> 02:36:53,920
9 30 to 11 30. i'm thinking of moving it

3971
02:36:53,920 --> 02:36:57,200
back to maybe 10 or 10 30 so things are

3972
02:36:57,200 --> 02:36:58,640
a bit calmer and i could immediately

3973
02:36:58,640 --> 02:37:00,720
come into the market and start teaching

3974
02:37:00,720 --> 02:37:02,960
and then you know i could end somewhere

3975
02:37:02,960 --> 02:37:04,319
around one

3976
02:37:04,319 --> 02:37:06,560
you know so there's there's a lot more

3977
02:37:06,560 --> 02:37:09,120
opportunity to get into more trades

3978
02:37:09,120 --> 02:37:10,960
between 11

3979
02:37:10,960 --> 02:37:12,640
and 2 o'clock

3980
02:37:12,640 --> 02:37:14,640
because those are the steady hours of

3981
02:37:14,640 --> 02:37:16,960
trading and the more volatile hours come

3982
02:37:16,960 --> 02:37:19,359
in between two to four and

3983
02:37:19,359 --> 02:37:23,040
nine to eleven o'clock so i can do that

3984
02:37:23,040 --> 02:37:26,000
if if that's a better way to teach and

3985
02:37:26,000 --> 02:37:27,840
and it's a slower way to help people

3986
02:37:27,840 --> 02:37:28,720
learn

3987
02:37:28,720 --> 02:37:32,479
um and utilize these concepts

3988
02:37:32,479 --> 02:37:34,720
yeah that's exactly what it is it's it's

3989
02:37:34,720 --> 02:37:37,040
the liquidity providers that

3990
02:37:37,040 --> 02:37:39,520
that they're definitely making money

3991
02:37:39,520 --> 02:37:42,000
on the behalf of their clients as well

3992
02:37:42,000 --> 02:37:43,040
as

3993
02:37:43,040 --> 02:37:44,960
you know screwing over the retail

3994
02:37:44,960 --> 02:37:47,439
investor so

3995
02:37:47,439 --> 02:37:50,160
yes they they do manipulate price you

3996
02:37:50,160 --> 02:37:53,040
know a lot um especially citadel citadel

3997
02:37:53,040 --> 02:37:55,200
blackrock all those different companies

3998
02:37:55,200 --> 02:37:57,280
they they are not working for us at all

3999
02:37:57,280 --> 02:37:58,800
so anything that they're doing you want

4000
02:37:58,800 --> 02:38:01,920
to pay attention to and guard yourself

4001
02:38:01,920 --> 02:38:04,240
from those practices because their only

4002
02:38:04,240 --> 02:38:07,040
job is to create profit for the people

4003
02:38:07,040 --> 02:38:08,720
that they're working for

4004
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:11,520
so um or or the special interests that

4005
02:38:11,520 --> 02:38:13,120
they're on the behalf of

4006
02:38:13,120 --> 02:38:15,359
