we

61
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:30,400
need at this point I just need to

62
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:34,200
eat the the coffee beans as chips you

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,799
know I think that's what I need to

64
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,080
do just munch on

65
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,280
caffeine I used to eat the nestly powder

66
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:51,040
out of the the uh the Box you just eat

67
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:53,760
the instant

68
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:59,519
coffee yeah so um I want to make sure

69
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:02,079
that that uh C me to F the strategy yeah

70
00:04:02,079 --> 00:04:04,439
yeah exactly exactly that's the bridge

71
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,879
underwater they don't know that there

72
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:09,280
coffee that's all it

73
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,519
is uh so you guys um I want to make sure

74
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:20,880
everybody's familiar with um swing

75
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,720
points you guys

76
00:04:24,919 --> 00:04:27,800
understand swing points right and it's a

77
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,600
bit ugly but

78
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:33,919
I make sure you guys

79
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:39,000
are familiar with this so these are

80
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,880
essentially a series of highs and lows

81
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,280
in an

82
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,759
uptrend and then whatever would would be

83
00:04:50,759 --> 00:04:53,199
here this this would be the next high

84
00:04:53,199 --> 00:05:00,919
here um so with these highs and lows um

85
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:03,759
whenever you have this low put in and

86
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,759
you have a high a new high introduced

87
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:11,520
that breaks Above This High

88
00:05:11,520 --> 00:05:16,280
here that validates this low as the

89
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,960
protected low in terms of the

90
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,720
trend so now you're looking for price to

91
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,479
come back within the range of this

92
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:30,479
high

93
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,720
and this

94
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:36,120
low and a lot of the

95
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,919
times when price comes back within the

96
00:05:38,919 --> 00:05:41,960
area there are different areas that

97
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:45,400
price often goes to

98
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:47,960
um some people talk about the discount

99
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:49,840
area some people talk about the premium

100
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,280
area you know there's there's quite a

101
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:55,720
few areas that price Taps into

102
00:05:55,720 --> 00:05:58,639
um you know whenever it is that that

103
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:01,240
we're trending up or trending down the

104
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:03,360
same thing goes for for downtrend as

105
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,199
well

106
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,199
so what happens here is that price Taps

107
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:14,280
into an area that's below here that's

108
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:17,199
below this low below this high price

109
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:21,319
Taps into an area around here that's

110
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,599
responsible for the break of this and by

111
00:06:26,599 --> 00:06:28,400
responsible I

112
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:30,240
mean

113
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:35,000
let me see if I could find an area now

114
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,479
uh maybe an area we tapped into I think

115
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,800
I just actually caught

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:46,960
one right

117
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,400
here so if you guys

118
00:06:55,510 --> 00:06:57,800
[Music]

119
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,280
look this is the

120
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,479
high right here this is the last low

121
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,919
that's right here obviously we're

122
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:09,759
shifting structure to the top side you

123
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:11,680
know here like you know usually when we

124
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:13,440
want to see our bullish flip so this

125
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,879
would be the long here that we're

126
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:17,560
generally

127
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,199
taking but oftentimes you have it to

128
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:23,680
where if price crosses above a high you

129
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,599
know a high is taken

130
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,400
out there's usually an area below this

131
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,919
last high that was taken out that was

132
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,520
responsible

133
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:40,360
for the structural shift

134
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:45,360
above so usually it's an snd zone or

135
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,919
there's some sort of imbalance that

136
00:07:46,919 --> 00:07:49,199
price may end up tapping into and a lot

137
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,080
of the times there there is an snd Zone

138
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,680
below

139
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,199
here

140
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,440
but if there's multiple snd zones

141
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,720
often times you can rule out the

142
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:06,680
lowest because there are times where

143
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:09,599
this has mitigation already within

144
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,560
itself as price is pushing up above now

145
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,000
there if you look here there's not um a

146
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:19,240
lot of mitigation here already you know

147
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:21,360
so price just happened to trade higher

148
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:23,039
but there was an

149
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:25,120
imbalance let me

150
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,759
actually make this visible for you guys

151
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:31,199
there was in imbalan directly above the

152
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:33,679
area this area

153
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:37,479
here this was the last down move that

154
00:08:37,479 --> 00:08:40,719
sent price up to break structure to the

155
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,080
top side the last down move that sent

156
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:49,360
price up so often times the last down

157
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,720
move is where price is coming back to

158
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,240
mitigate before it trades

159
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:58,360
higher so what I did was I saw this

160
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,360
imbalance directly above the zone and I

161
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,600
usually say utilize the imbalances that

162
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,079
are nearest to the snd D Zone so I had

163
00:09:11,079 --> 00:09:14,040
this imbalance here this is when uh the

164
00:09:14,040 --> 00:09:18,120
the market opened over here price tapped

165
00:09:18,120 --> 00:09:21,160
the imbalance right

166
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,320
here right above the snd Zone

167
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:27,200
responsible for the structural break to

168
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:29,880
the top side

169
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:32,399
price Taps this instead of tapping into

170
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:33,079
the

171
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:37,040
zone and it takes us

172
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,760
up so the first tap usually is a scalp

173
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,760
the second tap is you're looking for a

174
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:46,920
double bottom on the right side and then

175
00:09:46,920 --> 00:09:49,920
price goes up so you see we're still

176
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:53,320
actually pushing from from this this

177
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:56,519
area of Market open right here at this

178
00:09:56,519 --> 00:09:59,480
imbal this this imbalance that's here

179
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:01,120
but if you

180
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:04,800
look there are swing points that you

181
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,200
know price is making as it continues

182
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,600
higher there are some swing points that

183
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,640
price doesn't return back

184
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:15,399
to right

185
00:10:15,399 --> 00:10:18,959
here price doesn't go back to it just

186
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,320
because it hasn't gotten here or hasn't

187
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,959
come to mitigate here does not mean that

188
00:10:25,959 --> 00:10:29,200
you can't get involved on anything High

189
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,399
higher than this most people are waiting

190
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,720
for it to come back here and if it never

191
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:39,360
does they're just watching price and not

192
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:42,519
getting in so now what they're trying to

193
00:10:42,519 --> 00:10:43,360
do

194
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,920
is they're trying to catch the sell up

195
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:48,519
here to come down here or try to catch

196
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,240
the sell up here to come down here or

197
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,519
try to catch the sell up here to come

198
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:56,519
down here and and they're exhaustingly

199
00:10:56,519 --> 00:10:59,760
looking for nothing but sales trying to

200
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,040
come back down to this

201
00:11:02,040 --> 00:11:07,480
area because they believe that price is

202
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:09,200
going to come back

203
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,399
to this area to mitigate

204
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:15,000
it and they continue to do that over and

205
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:17,040
over and over again and it looks exactly

206
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:20,040
like this short here short there short

207
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:21,519
there short there short there short

208
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,440
there short there just trying to create

209
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:27,360
a short to fit The Narrative of price

210
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:30,959
coming back to the area

211
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:34,560
and it doesn't make it that but the

212
00:11:34,560 --> 00:11:38,639
thing about swing

213
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:46,480
points up here let me actually uh move

214
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
this and then erase

215
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:54,720
this H

216
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:00,959
yikes

217
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:08,720
so the thing about swing

218
00:12:08,839 --> 00:12:12,079
points are

219
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,880
that you could have price come down

220
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,440
here and you could have price stop here

221
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:22,360
you could have price make its way back

222
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:24,320
up

223
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,000
there and you could have price come here

224
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,880
and it could look like this

225
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,000
and for you you

226
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:41,040
see an order block

227
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,120
here an order block

228
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:49,880
here an order block

229
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:54,320
here and as price is

230
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:58,160
trending you're trying to figure out

231
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,360
price could be making making its way

232
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:04,560
down now let's say let's say we get you

233
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,800
know move here we

234
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,800
get just come up

235
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,760
above come

236
00:13:12,760 --> 00:13:16,240
here tap into the air we go short now we

237
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,360
short below this

238
00:13:18,360 --> 00:13:24,680
low we tap here most people see this tap

239
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:27,760
here most people see this tab

240
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:30,040
here

241
00:13:30,040 --> 00:13:32,760
and they automatically think that we're

242
00:13:32,760 --> 00:13:34,279
putting in another

243
00:13:34,279 --> 00:13:37,279
high

244
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,680
here but often times we end up getting a

245
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:43,800
tap

246
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,399
here to retrace up into some area left

247
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:51,680
behind here and then we continue

248
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:56,160
down then we tap here and they think

249
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:58,360
we're bullish and we're we're going to

250
00:13:58,360 --> 00:13:59,920
heaven

251
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:02,120
and we end up tapping into some area

252
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:08,560
just above and then we come back down to

253
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:12,040
here then they're playing this as

254
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:14,240
bullish trying to

255
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,800
find this bullish move that's going to

256
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:19,440
take us up here and let's say it comes

257
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,920
all the way

258
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:24,360
here and

259
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,440
then it continues

260
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:32,440
down like that and they

261
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,600
have trades that

262
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:40,079
are

263
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,880
here trades that are

264
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,000
here trades that are

265
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,639
here some losses maybe up

266
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:53,199
here you know like

267
00:14:53,199 --> 00:14:56,279
here another trade down

268
00:14:56,279 --> 00:15:00,800
here all trying to catch price going

269
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:05,199
up trying to catch the bottom of

270
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,600
price because of these areas to the

271
00:15:10,600 --> 00:15:15,079
left that they're confusing themselves

272
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:20,240
about so I mentioned that the areas to

273
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,199
the

274
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:23,959
right are the areas that you want to pay

275
00:15:23,959 --> 00:15:27,040
attention to in terms of getting

276
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,319
involved in

277
00:15:29,319 --> 00:15:32,440
continuations the areas on the left are

278
00:15:32,440 --> 00:15:36,120
areas that you're looking for price to

279
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:40,399
possibly reverse and then continue up

280
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:41,720
out of the

281
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:45,360
area so the the area to the left is

282
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,839
looking for

283
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:50,199
reversals but often times we're

284
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,160
confusing oursel with these demand zones

285
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:55,839
that are here and we're trying to trade

286
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:57,279
each and every one of them there could

287
00:15:57,279 --> 00:15:59,360
be like a smaller one in here here there

288
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,199
could be like a very tiny one here and

289
00:16:03,199 --> 00:16:05,720
we're playing all of this trying to just

290
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:08,680
get a move going

291
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:11,680
up

292
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:15,759
and we're losing on some of

293
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,639
them so

294
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:22,480
now we get into a buy here it takes us

295
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,639
out we jump into a cell

296
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,240
here and it goes up takes us out

297
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:32,040
we jump into a buy right here it goes

298
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,319
down take us

299
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:38,199
out we jump into a sell here it goes up

300
00:16:38,199 --> 00:16:42,360
takes us out we jump into a buy here it

301
00:16:42,360 --> 00:16:45,160
goes down takes us out and that's how

302
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,720
the cycle of Madness continues to

303
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,240
look it continues to look that way and

304
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,920
it's because we're confusing ourselves

305
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,480
let me actually take some this we're

306
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,199
confusing

307
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:04,799
ourselves with these

308
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:11,079
zones as prices coming down instead

309
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,160
of instead

310
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,559
of looking for an area that's

311
00:17:27,400 --> 00:17:30,200
here

312
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:33,880
or or an area that's

313
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:37,520
here you know or an area that's

314
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:42,480
here for price to make its way back up

315
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:45,760
to like

316
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:51,120
this we're looking over here and trying

317
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,960
to chase the history within the past

318
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:56,679
because we're trying to find

319
00:17:56,679 --> 00:17:58,960
reversals rather than look looking at

320
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,000
areas that are being tapped into on the

321
00:18:01,000 --> 00:18:04,919
right side for continuations

322
00:18:04,919 --> 00:18:08,679
down so if you see something is trending

323
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:11,280
down find an area to get in as it's

324
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,520
going down you'll see the reversal at

325
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:17,520
whatever important area that price may

326
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,280
come in

327
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:21,799
touch whether it's below or whether it's

328
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,679
above you'll see the

329
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:26,799
reversal within a specific area that

330
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,840
it's being rejected from like a Supply

331
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:30,880
area from the higher time frame or

332
00:18:30,880 --> 00:18:33,960
demand area from the higher time

333
00:18:33,960 --> 00:18:36,640
frame so we're trying to catch all of

334
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,120
this down below

335
00:18:40,120 --> 00:18:43,200
and these moves are giving us

336
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,600
more these moves here they're giving us

337
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:54,840
more these moves here they're giving us

338
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:55,919
way

339
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:58,520
more but in in turn we're trying to to

340
00:18:58,520 --> 00:19:01,640
catch this and trying to catch this and

341
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,039
trying to catch this and trying to catch

342
00:19:04,039 --> 00:19:07,159
this and trying to catch hoping one of

343
00:19:07,159 --> 00:19:09,159
them

344
00:19:09,159 --> 00:19:12,080
is the point of reversal and we can take

345
00:19:12,080 --> 00:19:15,080
it all the way back up

346
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,840
there and that's how we end up losing

347
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,840
more trades than

348
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,440
winning so what I always

349
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:28,880
mention while we are trading is that

350
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:32,280
whatever direction we're looking to head

351
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:37,640
to based on the higher time frame

352
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,360
bias

353
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:42,919
take one

354
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:47,600
trade going in that

355
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:52,280
direction this would already be shifted

356
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,440
to break even after one structural low

357
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,640
is taken

358
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:58,280
out and you would just be taking this

359
00:19:58,280 --> 00:20:01,559
one trade here going

360
00:20:01,559 --> 00:20:04,400
down and what you can I you can play

361
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,320
either side of the market at this point

362
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,240
because

363
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:12,200
now when you get in here you know it's

364
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:15,320
just a quick Scout when you get in here

365
00:20:15,320 --> 00:20:17,440
you know it's just a quick Scout when

366
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,240
you get in here you know it's just a

367
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,000
quick Scout and before you know

368
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:25,440
it you can get all the way down

369
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,120
here and these little scalps gave you

370
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:32,919
way more Pips way more money because

371
00:20:32,919 --> 00:20:35,799
these these little scalps here can be

372
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:38,679
high lot siiz scalps you're already in

373
00:20:38,679 --> 00:20:42,679
profit coming down so at any point that

374
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:43,640
you

375
00:20:43,640 --> 00:20:47,799
are an extra profit you could leverage

376
00:20:47,799 --> 00:20:51,159
that extra profit also with just a

377
00:20:51,159 --> 00:20:53,679
higher lot size to scalp up real quick

378
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,640
so this might be coming down on like a

379
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:01,360
one lot where it's it's $10 sorry or or

380
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:04,400
$1 per pip let's say it's coming down $1

381
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:08,039
per pip and you're already here let's

382
00:21:08,039 --> 00:21:11,159
say I don't know uh

383
00:21:11,159 --> 00:21:15,600
uh you're $200 in the positive

384
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:18,120
here now when you're catching these

385
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:21,120
little scalps up you might be able to do

386
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:22,840
$10 per pip

387
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,480
here take a quick 10 20 Pips 200 bucks

388
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,720
there and you're still

389
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:31,600
$200 coming down but you just made 200

390
00:21:31,600 --> 00:21:33,799
bucks on a quick Scout another 200 bucks

391
00:21:33,799 --> 00:21:35,799
on a quick Scout another 200 bucks on a

392
00:21:35,799 --> 00:21:37,919
quick Scout another 200 bucks on a quick

393
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:42,720
Skype wow this right here is just making

394
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:44,080
its way

395
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,120
downtown and still reaffirming that we

396
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:50,080
have been coming down from this

397
00:21:50,080 --> 00:21:55,159
area and we are still in profit and this

398
00:21:55,159 --> 00:21:58,080
profit that we are in we are head

399
00:21:58,080 --> 00:22:03,000
hedging against it to get little scalps

400
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,159
within these areas we're hedging against

401
00:22:05,159 --> 00:22:08,720
the profit that we're incoming down and

402
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,279
it can make it all the more profitable

403
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:14,480
while you're trading or what you can do

404
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:16,880
is just find areas that price comes back

405
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:21,840
up to to continue to compound going down

406
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,600
that's another way that you could manage

407
00:22:24,600 --> 00:22:26,080
your

408
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,480
risk but it would just be a appropriate

409
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,640
to the numbers that are in your account

410
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:33,760
and obviously you would not get greedy

411
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:35,679
you know you're not going to be $200 in

412
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:38,720
profit and now you know you're doing

413
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:42,039
$100 per pip you know you out in two

414
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:44,720
Pips you know or your profit is blown in

415
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:48,400
two Pips it starts to go the other way

416
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:52,000
so this is one way to have this just

417
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:53,960
coming from this area from and this is

418
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:56,279
usually a higher time frame area let me

419
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:00,279
say that you find this trade this one

420
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,480
trade that's usually trending in a

421
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:05,120
particular area it's usually from a

422
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:07,000
higher time frame

423
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,159
rejection and it's heading down or back

424
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:13,679
down to some sort of imbalance or snd

425
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,960
that's below so that one trade is when

426
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,520
you usually see the larger structural

427
00:23:21,520 --> 00:23:24,279
bearish or bullish trip bullish flip

428
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,760
sorry bearish or bullish flip you see

429
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:31,000
the larger struct Cal one and then you

430
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,880
take price down and you're anticipating

431
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:36,760
with each pullback either you could play

432
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:40,200
a quick scalp going up or you can play

433
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:43,440
adding another entry in going down after

434
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,799
it Taps into whatever imbalance that may

435
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:48,440
be here whatever snd that may be here

436
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,440
Taps into there then you just add in

437
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:54,080
another order to continue and the profit

438
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:58,799
from this order here is now allowing you

439
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:01,600
to put in a second order directly below

440
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:04,279
it even if this does come into a little

441
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:06,679
draw down you're still in profit from

442
00:24:06,679 --> 00:24:08,760
this order here so it's only cutting

443
00:24:08,760 --> 00:24:11,760
back into some of the profit from the

444
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,279
previous area but you're in no draw down

445
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:17,919
you're still in profit with both trades

446
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:23,360
but this can only come from

447
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,919
understanding Market structure though

448
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,000
these snd zones are not not snd zones

449
00:24:29,000 --> 00:24:31,880
that are responsible for structural

450
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:35,880
breaks these snd zones often times let

451
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:38,279
me move this down a little bit these snd

452
00:24:38,279 --> 00:24:43,279
D zones often times

453
00:24:44,399 --> 00:24:48,720
uh these snd D zones often times serve

454
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,159
I'm talking about the you see the the

455
00:24:51,159 --> 00:24:53,720
down move before price shifts

456
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:57,440
up the Zone that's left behind the high

457
00:24:57,440 --> 00:25:01,840
and the low that's left behind when

458
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:05,159
price moves out of the

459
00:25:05,159 --> 00:25:10,279
area the high and the low that's left

460
00:25:10,279 --> 00:25:14,120
behind when price shifts above this

461
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:17,159
area price can come back into it

462
00:25:17,159 --> 00:25:20,760
sometimes and then leave but there are

463
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:23,240
times where price like this doesn't go

464
00:25:23,240 --> 00:25:25,679
back to it and continues to Trend

465
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:31,559
up this is an unmitigated area now if

466
00:25:31,559 --> 00:25:34,120
this area here is not

467
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:37,120
responsible

468
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,399
for let's

469
00:25:56,679 --> 00:25:59,679
see

470
00:26:03,440 --> 00:26:06,799
right here so we have we have this high

471
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:09,039
right

472
00:26:12,679 --> 00:26:16,320
here we have this

473
00:26:21,200 --> 00:26:25,679
High let me move this down a little

474
00:26:26,600 --> 00:26:29,600
bit

475
00:26:38,690 --> 00:26:42,079
[Music]

476
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:49,279
we have this High

477
00:26:49,279 --> 00:26:51,679
created we still have some area that

478
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:54,840
price fell from down

479
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:59,600
there so we're looking

480
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:02,640
for the area

481
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:05,559
responsible for flipping us above the

482
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:09,720
structural high right here we're looking

483
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:13,960
for that area responsible somewhere down

484
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:17,600
here for shifting us above this because

485
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:20,120
that particular area is where we are

486
00:27:20,120 --> 00:27:22,880
going to tap

487
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:28,399
into and then take another leg up

488
00:27:28,399 --> 00:27:30,520
that's the bullish area that price is

489
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:33,640
looking to make its way back

490
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:36,799
to so bear with me it's all going to

491
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:39,640
come together in a

492
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,039
few it's going to come together when we

493
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:48,760
when we get to the charts I'm going to

494
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,000
show you guys

495
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:52,240
this know it feels like a college

496
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,000
lecture but you know just bear with me

497
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:58,679
so this area here here is not

498
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:01,880
responsible for anything this area down

499
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,679
here is

500
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:06,480
responsible but when price comes to this

501
00:28:06,480 --> 00:28:10,600
area here price still gives you a

502
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,000
reaction to go

503
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:16,399
up but that reaction that you're getting

504
00:28:16,399 --> 00:28:21,159
from here to go up is just a retracement

505
00:28:21,159 --> 00:28:25,159
to go to a particular area and tap into

506
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,240
that area above to come back down

507
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,320
below the

508
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:35,000
area that price tapped

509
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:38,360
into so you have

510
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:41,320
people trying to

511
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,000
buy

512
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:47,559
buy buy buy they continue to do that

513
00:28:47,559 --> 00:28:51,360
over and over and over again rather than

514
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:56,320
understanding that it's

515
00:28:56,399 --> 00:28:59,360
by to

516
00:28:59,360 --> 00:29:01,880
sell to

517
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,679
buy to

518
00:29:04,679 --> 00:29:08,679
sell to buy that's how the market

519
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:12,640
moves the market moves like that and you

520
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:13,840
can

521
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:18,679
time each and every one of those Taps

522
00:29:18,679 --> 00:29:21,440
you can time them they may not be

523
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,720
entirely perfect but you can time them

524
00:29:25,720 --> 00:29:29,519
and create a system around it so as we

525
00:29:29,519 --> 00:29:32,799
have this trend going

526
00:29:32,799 --> 00:29:35,919
down we have now mind you this is the

527
00:29:35,919 --> 00:29:37,919
higher time frame area that we tapped

528
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:40,519
into so if we rejected from a higher

529
00:29:40,519 --> 00:29:42,600
time frame we know that it's a heavy

530
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:46,080
rejection from somewhere up here and

531
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,679
we're coming back to something down

532
00:29:48,679 --> 00:29:51,559
here because it's rejecting from Supply

533
00:29:51,559 --> 00:29:54,760
on the higher time frame to demand

534
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,320
somewhere down

535
00:29:56,320 --> 00:29:59,360
here so on the higher time frame we

536
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:01,559
understand that that's where price is

537
00:30:01,559 --> 00:30:06,960
targeting but on the lower time frame we

538
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:11,799
see price trending this

539
00:30:11,799 --> 00:30:15,480
way and we're looking for areas to get

540
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:18,279
involved in

541
00:30:18,279 --> 00:30:20,720
price and there are areas that you can

542
00:30:20,720 --> 00:30:21,559
get

543
00:30:21,559 --> 00:30:26,159
involved where you don't have to utilize

544
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,240
the current

545
00:30:29,279 --> 00:30:33,600
Trend or you can utilize the current

546
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:37,600
Trend it just depends on how you see the

547
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:40,200
market you utilize the current Trend

548
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:42,640
you're going to get

549
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:46,480
more more value for your

550
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:49,720
trade you're catching an area or tapping

551
00:30:49,720 --> 00:30:53,519
into an area to break structure to the

552
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,039
downside so you get a discounted move

553
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:58,880
and and then

554
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:02,200
some you at least get two times what you

555
00:31:02,200 --> 00:31:03,320
were

556
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:05,880
expecting either the the the break of

557
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:08,240
the structural low is one and then it

558
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:11,240
could cross other structures below if

559
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,559
there are no bullish areas that pric is

560
00:31:13,559 --> 00:31:15,919
tapping

561
00:31:16,200 --> 00:31:20,200
into but remember since this is a bias

562
00:31:20,200 --> 00:31:23,639
from the higher time

563
00:31:23,639 --> 00:31:27,240
frame all of these moves up we know that

564
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:30,679
are just temporary retracements until we

565
00:31:30,679 --> 00:31:33,360
might see on the higher time frame that

566
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:35,840
oh maybe there was an imbalance within

567
00:31:35,840 --> 00:31:38,519
here on the higher time frame and then

568
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,480
it sent price up to here maybe we

569
00:31:41,480 --> 00:31:43,120
miscalculated on

570
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,720
that you know or it would just continue

571
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:49,360
to the overall targets sometimes it's

572
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:51,519
just based on what people have charted

573
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:53,919
out there there are people who have

574
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,159
certain um demand zones charted out

575
00:31:57,159 --> 00:31:58,960
certain Supply zones charted out and

576
00:31:58,960 --> 00:32:01,279
they miss the tiniest imbalance that's

577
00:32:01,279 --> 00:32:03,519
there and price actually Taps that and

578
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:04,600
goes

579
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,399
away because they didn't have it charted

580
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:09,760
out when you have these things charted

581
00:32:09,760 --> 00:32:12,399
out it's giving you an explanation for

582
00:32:12,399 --> 00:32:14,679
everything that price reacted off of and

583
00:32:14,679 --> 00:32:17,519
why price retraced where price retraced

584
00:32:17,519 --> 00:32:20,200
to and where price continued down to

585
00:32:20,200 --> 00:32:23,559
when you see that over and over and over

586
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:25,120
and over and over and over and over and

587
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:26,799
over and over and over and over again

588
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:28,320
like

589
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:33,200
you begin to become confident in playing

590
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:37,080
different sides of the market only

591
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,720
relative to that

592
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:44,399
rule that you have on whatever side of

593
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,519
the market it is that you're looking to

594
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,760
get involved in so I'm going to take you

595
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,320
guys to the charts now and show you guys

596
00:32:53,320 --> 00:32:59,039
exactly how this plays out on the charts

597
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,230
let's see let's find a

598
00:33:13,230 --> 00:33:16,359
[Music]

599
00:33:23,399 --> 00:33:26,679
trend I want to find a clean Trend so

600
00:33:26,679 --> 00:33:27,720
it's

601
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:31,919
um just easier to give an

602
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:33,799
explanation

603
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:37,399
to and

604
00:33:37,559 --> 00:33:41,039
um yeah let

605
00:33:41,679 --> 00:33:44,000
me because there's different ways to

606
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,480
play this it's just that I'm introducing

607
00:33:47,480 --> 00:33:49,840
this to you

608
00:33:49,840 --> 00:33:53,480
guys and you have to be able

609
00:33:53,480 --> 00:33:58,960
to play the foundation of it first

610
00:33:59,639 --> 00:34:00,519
and

611
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:04,399
then you can kind of add your own thing

612
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:05,559
into

613
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:08,559
it

614
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:16,399
um so let's

615
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:18,839
see try to see let me see if I could

616
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:22,919
find a pair that be

617
00:34:25,879 --> 00:34:28,879
swanging

618
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,480
yeah let me see if I can find a pair

619
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,159
that's

620
00:34:35,040 --> 00:34:39,480
uh it's giving us some nice

621
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:47,918
swings I think oil had some nice swings

622
00:34:47,918 --> 00:34:52,358
today uh nope it did

623
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:57,320
not you can you got you guys probably

624
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,119
see me scrolling around looking for a

625
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:01,079
particular area and thinking oh well

626
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:02,800
maybe this doesn't happen everywhere it

627
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:05,960
does happen everywhere I'm just trying

628
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:09,280
to find a cleaner area to to show you

629
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,240
guys how it plays out so you're not um

630
00:35:12,240 --> 00:35:14,800
struggling with the basic understanding

631
00:35:14,800 --> 00:35:18,200
of it let me maybe go to the 15 minute

632
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:21,400
um because those moves tend to be

633
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,119
clean um okay right here oh look look we

634
00:35:25,119 --> 00:35:28,599
have do we

635
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,359
okay so we talked about swing

636
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:35,119
Point

637
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,359
within certain

638
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:39,880
Trends

639
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:43,440
um there are swing points within swing

640
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:46,440
points within swing

641
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:49,319
points

642
00:35:49,319 --> 00:35:52,119
so you know you

643
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:54,040
have

644
00:35:54,040 --> 00:35:57,319
this here you go up

645
00:35:57,319 --> 00:35:59,200
break structure to the

646
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:02,200
downside

647
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,319
this this last move here the swing up to

648
00:36:07,319 --> 00:36:08,880
where price broke structure to the

649
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,760
downside this is the last swing

650
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:17,280
point that price had then

651
00:36:17,280 --> 00:36:20,920
price goes break structure to the

652
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:23,960
upside price comes down to this area

653
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:27,440
here and then price pushes up

654
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:30,880
to here price comes down to this area

655
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:34,920
here and then price pushes up to here

656
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:38,040
price comes to this area here up to here

657
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:39,440
so you guys get the understanding you

658
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,359
see how none of the Swing points really

659
00:36:42,359 --> 00:36:44,560
do not look the

660
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,960
same you know they really don't look the

661
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:49,400
same in terms of there was some sideways

662
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:53,119
movement within this whole swing Point

663
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:55,680
here probably shifted

664
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:59,240
up then there's you know movement down

665
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,839
into this area tapped in and then price

666
00:37:01,839 --> 00:37:07,160
shifted up so what we

667
00:37:07,160 --> 00:37:09,160
also don't

668
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,160
see or or maybe don't even uh consider

669
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:17,200
as we're looking at those swing

670
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:21,280
points is that within this area

671
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:24,079
here there are

672
00:37:24,079 --> 00:37:28,599
also swing points happening

673
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:35,359
also swing

674
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,599
points just

675
00:37:45,599 --> 00:37:47,480
smaller

676
00:37:47,480 --> 00:37:50,760
so we

677
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:58,599
have we have this here

678
00:38:00,319 --> 00:38:03,560
we have this here on the inside these

679
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:07,079
swing points on the inside along with

680
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:08,319
these swing

681
00:38:08,319 --> 00:38:11,720
points on the

682
00:38:16,280 --> 00:38:18,880
outside these are

683
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,040
institutional swing

684
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:25,520
points when these swing points are

685
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:29,359
violated that's when the uptrend is

686
00:38:29,359 --> 00:38:31,040
getting ready to

687
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:34,720
shift and assume a downtrend so you

688
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,800
would have a violation of this

689
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:40,160
structural institutional

690
00:38:40,160 --> 00:38:43,200
LW you'll have price retrace into the

691
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,720
area and then you'll have a short out of

692
00:38:45,720 --> 00:38:48,880
it and that would be the beginning of a

693
00:38:48,880 --> 00:38:52,119
new trend the beginning of a

694
00:38:52,119 --> 00:38:56,240
downtrend and you can spot that on your

695
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:57,520
own

696
00:38:57,520 --> 00:39:01,280
by just keeping track of these pivot

697
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,240
Points but there's the inside

698
00:39:04,240 --> 00:39:07,480
structure pivot Points and then there's

699
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:10,200
also the outside structure pivot Points

700
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,040
and a lot of this is

701
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:18,119
explained here in this video you know so

702
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:23,319
I'm just giving you guys a piece of that

703
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:28,440
but what I'm going to show you guys

704
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:31,440
is with utilizing what I'm showing you

705
00:39:31,440 --> 00:39:35,680
you need to know structure you need to

706
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:41,440
know how to utilize swing points that's

707
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,359
imperative that you know that so with

708
00:39:45,359 --> 00:39:48,079
institutional swing

709
00:39:48,079 --> 00:39:51,880
points along with smaller time frame or

710
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:54,040
or smaller structure swing

711
00:39:54,040 --> 00:39:58,319
points often times

712
00:39:58,319 --> 00:40:02,480
price will go above a particular

713
00:40:02,480 --> 00:40:07,560
swing come back to it and trade

714
00:40:07,560 --> 00:40:11,319
higher and because you have small swings

715
00:40:11,319 --> 00:40:14,599
large swings you want to know within

716
00:40:14,599 --> 00:40:16,160
those

717
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:19,000
swings within this swing

718
00:40:19,000 --> 00:40:22,839
here you have price break above

719
00:40:22,839 --> 00:40:28,359
here there are multiple areas

720
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,880
that you see price can price can reverse

721
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,119
and come in touch here you might have

722
00:40:34,119 --> 00:40:36,599
this area marked out you might have this

723
00:40:36,599 --> 00:40:39,640
area marked out and there's so

724
00:40:39,640 --> 00:40:41,640
many wha

725
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:46,160
ifs about price tapping into these

726
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:48,040
areas

727
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,920
so what we mentioned was

728
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:55,839
that this is yes a smaller swing point

729
00:40:55,839 --> 00:40:59,920
but also a demand Zone that's

730
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,160
responsible for breaking structure to

731
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,040
the top side breaking this structure

732
00:41:06,040 --> 00:41:09,160
here so you're looking to trade from

733
00:41:09,160 --> 00:41:12,280
here not here not here you're looking to

734
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:15,960
trade from the area responsible for a

735
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:18,839
breaking structure now what I will say

736
00:41:18,839 --> 00:41:20,839
about utilizing that area responsible

737
00:41:20,839 --> 00:41:23,560
for breaking structure is that often

738
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:27,119
times when prices has shift

739
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,839
bearish already from somewhere up

740
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,520
here that doesn't

741
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,839
hold and price continues going down we

742
00:41:37,839 --> 00:41:40,480
might have already tapped into an snd

743
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:44,160
above but we're looking to come back to

744
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:47,359
this here to go bullish without paying

745
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:49,079
attention to what just happened at the

746
00:41:49,079 --> 00:41:51,560
higher time frame up

747
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:54,119
here so we get

748
00:41:54,119 --> 00:41:57,400
confused as to why it didn't work out

749
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:59,599
and why price came further down here

750
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,680
maybe and then maybe came up here and

751
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:03,640
then down here and maybe came up here

752
00:42:03,640 --> 00:42:05,319
and then down here and we're trying to

753
00:42:05,319 --> 00:42:08,319
figure out why this didn't hold or sorry

754
00:42:08,319 --> 00:42:10,680
why this didn't

755
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:13,200
hold and it's

756
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:16,920
because you may have missed something

757
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:20,359
from the supply area from the top area

758
00:42:20,359 --> 00:42:22,440
we might be getting rejected from an

759
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,960
imbalance from a Zone you know that's

760
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:27,640
above there there's there's plenty of

761
00:42:27,640 --> 00:42:30,040
explanations as to why price would shift

762
00:42:30,040 --> 00:42:31,960
through there but you would also know

763
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:34,839
that since that was the last area that

764
00:42:34,839 --> 00:42:38,240
price could hit and put in a new high if

765
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:40,359
it goes below that area then consider

766
00:42:40,359 --> 00:42:43,240
the rest of the area lunch me and that

767
00:42:43,240 --> 00:42:45,640
gives you a bias that price is often

768
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:48,240
going to shift through these areas so

769
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:51,839
with these areas here you see how price

770
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:54,559
never came down and touch these areas

771
00:42:54,559 --> 00:42:56,920
with these areas here

772
00:42:56,920 --> 00:43:01,839
if price ends up coming down to maybe

773
00:43:01,839 --> 00:43:06,400
mitigate this area below sorry this area

774
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,920
below here if price comes down to

775
00:43:08,920 --> 00:43:11,720
mitigate this area below right here I

776
00:43:11,720 --> 00:43:13,480
don't know let me let me

777
00:43:13,480 --> 00:43:16,800
just okay yeah right here let's say

778
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:19,760
price comes down to mitigate this area

779
00:43:19,760 --> 00:43:22,520
below you're going

780
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:26,800
to see that you'll get a reaction from

781
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:28,000
each one of

782
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,000
these even if they're even even if

783
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,240
they're

784
00:43:33,240 --> 00:43:35,680
unmitigated even if they're unmitigated

785
00:43:35,680 --> 00:43:38,200
you'll get a reaction out of each and

786
00:43:38,200 --> 00:43:40,440
every one of these or not each and every

787
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,160
one most of them you'll get a reaction

788
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:47,440
up out of most of them like

789
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:55,079
that like

790
00:43:55,079 --> 00:43:57,040
that

791
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:59,520
even though this was responsible for the

792
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,520
structural

793
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:04,280
shift we already tapped into it and went

794
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:07,079
so if you have price coming back below

795
00:44:07,079 --> 00:44:08,319
this

796
00:44:08,319 --> 00:44:11,440
area then we're shorting through the

797
00:44:11,440 --> 00:44:16,119
area but we also have long opportunities

798
00:44:16,119 --> 00:44:18,240
that are present from here quick scalp

799
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:20,880
up here quick scalp up here quick scalp

800
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:23,480
up here quick scalp up while you're in

801
00:44:23,480 --> 00:44:27,559
one trade coming down here

802
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,760
so now you have one trade dropping and

803
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:35,000
then you have quick scalp up to trade

804
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:39,319
down quick scalp up to trade down quick

805
00:44:39,319 --> 00:44:44,119
scalp up to trade down so now you're

806
00:44:44,119 --> 00:44:47,440
understanding how the trend is

807
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,599
forming

808
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:53,720
so with this let me

809
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:58,040
actually go back to the us3 now for the

810
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,040
the overall

811
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:08,119
explanation this right here is a swing

812
00:45:08,319 --> 00:45:10,760
point this

813
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:14,359
high and this low swing Point price

814
00:45:14,359 --> 00:45:17,200
trades above price doesn't come back

815
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:22,599
into it this leaves an unmitigated area

816
00:45:22,599 --> 00:45:25,400
when price comes back to the area

817
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,160
usually trading down we're looking to

818
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:31,000
tap into the

819
00:45:31,000 --> 00:45:35,119
50% of that area and potentially get a

820
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:37,800
move to take us

821
00:45:37,800 --> 00:45:41,040
up so let me actually

822
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:44,720
see I didn't even pay

823
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,000
attention so you see right

824
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:54,480
here we tapped into the area you see the

825
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:57,240
middle right here where this crossair is

826
00:45:57,240 --> 00:45:59,000
we tapped into this

827
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:02,319
area and we pushed

828
00:46:02,319 --> 00:46:05,319
higher

829
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:11,839
so now that that you guys get an idea of

830
00:46:11,839 --> 00:46:16,440
Swing points swing points can be

831
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:20,960
utilized as some form of directional

832
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:22,720
bias and

833
00:46:22,720 --> 00:46:25,319
reversal and I say that because look it

834
00:46:25,319 --> 00:46:28,599
take for since this swing Point

835
00:46:28,599 --> 00:46:31,480
here price trades out of

836
00:46:31,480 --> 00:46:35,559
it comes back into this area back into

837
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:40,119
the swing Point price Taps the 50% of

838
00:46:40,119 --> 00:46:41,440
the Swing

839
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:43,599
Point

840
00:46:43,599 --> 00:46:46,400
here and keeps

841
00:46:46,400 --> 00:46:49,839
going but not just that if you happen to

842
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,720
miss the larger swing point there are

843
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:58,119
smaller swing points that are in here

844
00:46:58,119 --> 00:46:59,880
that build the

845
00:46:59,880 --> 00:47:04,040
trend so now you have this area here

846
00:47:04,040 --> 00:47:06,440
this tiny swing Point remember we just

847
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:09,520
missed this larger move but now we

848
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:12,640
looking for continuations so what do we

849
00:47:12,640 --> 00:47:16,920
have this tiny swing Point

850
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:18,839
here price

851
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:24,280
comes Taps into it and it

852
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:26,559
leaves we we

853
00:47:26,559 --> 00:47:29,640
see this swing Point here do we get

854
00:47:29,640 --> 00:47:31,319
anything from

855
00:47:31,319 --> 00:47:33,280
this

856
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,520
no there's another swing Point directly

857
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:40,400
above here but price ends up trading

858
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,280
through it but still continuing above so

859
00:47:44,280 --> 00:47:48,319
what do we have now this swing Point

860
00:47:48,319 --> 00:47:53,440
here this high and this

861
00:47:54,720 --> 00:47:57,720
low

862
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:01,880
now we place a square over the swing

863
00:48:01,880 --> 00:48:06,400
point when price trades above the swing

864
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:10,680
point above this swing point

865
00:48:10,680 --> 00:48:12,559
this this

866
00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:16,920
move this move went up to here traded

867
00:48:16,920 --> 00:48:19,440
down below to here when price trades

868
00:48:19,440 --> 00:48:23,640
above this area above

869
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:26,599
this above this high

870
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:29,920
you're looking for price to come back

871
00:48:29,920 --> 00:48:32,079
into the

872
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:36,760
50% of this previous swing point that we

873
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,599
just traded above we just traded out of

874
00:48:40,599 --> 00:48:43,720
you're taking the area of the previous

875
00:48:43,720 --> 00:48:48,400
swing point you place a square around it

876
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:50,880
price comes back into the area of the

877
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:54,400
Swing point we tap right into the middle

878
00:48:54,400 --> 00:48:58,960
of it and we you trade

879
00:48:59,119 --> 00:49:02,880
higher you have another swing point that

880
00:49:02,880 --> 00:49:06,119
price creates

881
00:49:08,119 --> 00:49:10,720
here we didn't get price coming back

882
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,400
into it we had this where price came

883
00:49:13,400 --> 00:49:18,240
down and went back up but what do we do

884
00:49:18,240 --> 00:49:20,520
now we

885
00:49:20,520 --> 00:49:23,960
FIB I mean sorry we we take this swing

886
00:49:23,960 --> 00:49:25,920
Point here because this is also a swing

887
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,680
point this one down candle into this up

888
00:49:28,680 --> 00:49:31,480
move this is a swing Point too just on a

889
00:49:31,480 --> 00:49:35,799
lower time frame so what do we have

890
00:49:35,799 --> 00:49:37,799
price Taps

891
00:49:37,799 --> 00:49:41,240
into the center of this swing Point

892
00:49:41,240 --> 00:49:42,880
takes you

893
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:47,920
up but then price also Taps into the

894
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:52,400
center of this swing point and takes you

895
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:55,880
up actually it goes a little further

896
00:49:55,880 --> 00:49:58,920
into the swing Point down below to here

897
00:49:58,920 --> 00:50:01,799
and ends up taking you all the way up

898
00:50:01,799 --> 00:50:05,960
here but the same way that you can trade

899
00:50:05,960 --> 00:50:09,839
swing points as the trend is going up

900
00:50:09,839 --> 00:50:11,960
you can trade swing points as the trend

901
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,599
is going

902
00:50:15,640 --> 00:50:17,440
down

903
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:21,000
so here you have it this is the last

904
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:23,000
swing point I don't even know if it it

905
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:25,520
actually tapped but this is the last

906
00:50:25,520 --> 00:50:27,880
swing point this up move and price

907
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:30,200
shifted down out of

908
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:33,880
it when price shifted down below it it

909
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,160
came back into the

910
00:50:36,160 --> 00:50:39,400
area 50% of the Swing point you see

911
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:45,119
clean tap 50% of it the larger swing

912
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,119
point this here the larger swing point

913
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,920
this previous swing point it comes back

914
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:57,200
into 50% of it and then it shifts down

915
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:02,680
it leaves so often times you have it to

916
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:06,160
where there's large swing points there's

917
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:08,799
smaller swing points and price even

918
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,280
responds to the smaller swing point

919
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,040
because now look at this this is a

920
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:17,680
larger swing Point here exactly at this

921
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:20,920
area if you were to take the

922
00:51:20,920 --> 00:51:27,359
50% of this larger swing point

923
00:51:28,119 --> 00:51:32,079
and find the swing Point within it or

924
00:51:32,079 --> 00:51:34,359
maybe the imbalance that could be up

925
00:51:34,359 --> 00:51:35,559
here or

926
00:51:35,559 --> 00:51:38,480
something you would end up

927
00:51:38,480 --> 00:51:41,520
pinpointing the exact area that price is

928
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:44,559
coming to tap into and you may be able

929
00:51:44,559 --> 00:51:47,920
to short using that

930
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:52,040
area with the overall bias that we were

931
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:55,520
coming back up to the 50% of this swing

932
00:51:55,520 --> 00:51:57,640
point so now your bias is that we're

933
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,799
coming at back to the 50% of the Swing

934
00:51:59,799 --> 00:52:02,200
point but we find we found a smaller

935
00:52:02,200 --> 00:52:06,839
area in there within the 50% or

936
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:11,520
above that we can refine price to refine

937
00:52:11,520 --> 00:52:15,680
our entry to so we took the swing point

938
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,760
that was within the larger swing point

939
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,640
and we got a tap into it and price

940
00:52:21,640 --> 00:52:25,720
traded below so what you guys need to

941
00:52:25,720 --> 00:52:28,040
understand with these swing points is

942
00:52:28,040 --> 00:52:31,720
that the larger swing points are more

943
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:36,760
likely the smaller swing points are

944
00:52:36,760 --> 00:52:40,559
easier to break through and what most

945
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,319
people don't get is that these swing

946
00:52:44,319 --> 00:52:47,480
points up here these swing points that

947
00:52:47,480 --> 00:52:49,520
you guys see me marking they're just

948
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:51,319
Supply zones they're order blocks from

949
00:52:51,319 --> 00:52:54,079
the higher time

950
00:52:54,240 --> 00:52:57,160
frame

951
00:52:57,160 --> 00:52:58,780
right here let me see maybe the

952
00:52:58,780 --> 00:53:01,979
[Music]

953
00:53:04,599 --> 00:53:09,559
2hour this is one 2hour

954
00:53:09,559 --> 00:53:12,440
candle or even a

955
00:53:12,440 --> 00:53:15,000
fractal so you see this is a fractal

956
00:53:15,000 --> 00:53:16,559
from the

957
00:53:16,559 --> 00:53:18,960
2hour time

958
00:53:18,960 --> 00:53:22,839
frame but when you go lower it opens up

959
00:53:22,839 --> 00:53:25,599
to other things so this is why I'm

960
00:53:25,599 --> 00:53:28,720
saying utilize fractals as zones as well

961
00:53:28,720 --> 00:53:32,000
because fractals are Supply areas swing

962
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:35,960
points are Supply areas left behind so

963
00:53:35,960 --> 00:53:40,400
you have this swing Point

964
00:53:40,640 --> 00:53:43,520
here price trades up into it yeah

965
00:53:43,520 --> 00:53:45,040
there's a little bit of draw down

966
00:53:45,040 --> 00:53:46,520
sometimes depending on where you brought

967
00:53:46,520 --> 00:53:49,799
it where you drew it so this from this

968
00:53:49,799 --> 00:53:52,640
low I'm telling you to learn how to draw

969
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:55,160
from the low to the high and then when

970
00:53:55,160 --> 00:53:57,440
price trades below it you're looking for

971
00:53:57,440 --> 00:53:59,760
price to come back into the 50% of That

972
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:02,359
Swing that's what I'm telling you guys

973
00:54:02,359 --> 00:54:04,799
because you need to First be able to

974
00:54:04,799 --> 00:54:09,160
understand how this works but my actual

975
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:11,680
swing point when you start understanding

976
00:54:11,680 --> 00:54:15,240
swing points my actual swing point would

977
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:18,400
have just been the low of this candle

978
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:21,400
here to the high of this candle

979
00:54:21,400 --> 00:54:24,440
here and I would have got a cleaner top

980
00:54:24,440 --> 00:54:27,599
less drop down but price Taps into the

981
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:30,119
area and it trades

982
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,400
below so with these swing points you

983
00:54:34,400 --> 00:54:36,559
could utilize these swing points as

984
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:40,319
directional bias from the higher time

985
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,480
frames you could utilize them as

986
00:54:42,480 --> 00:54:46,440
directional bias so now that we have

987
00:54:46,440 --> 00:54:50,480
this swing Point here

988
00:54:51,240 --> 00:54:55,319
created now when price begins to Short

989
00:54:55,319 --> 00:54:58,440
if we're going to continue higher we

990
00:54:58,440 --> 00:55:01,359
need to find the reversal in the middle

991
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:05,839
of this previous swing Point

992
00:55:05,839 --> 00:55:07,720
here

993
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:10,160
sorry

994
00:55:10,160 --> 00:55:12,119
here so

995
00:55:12,119 --> 00:55:14,480
now when we're

996
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,599
shorting we have a

997
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:22,240
direction on where price is going to but

998
00:55:22,240 --> 00:55:26,640
we also have an area from this 50% % of

999
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:28,760
where price where we can potentially

1000
00:55:28,760 --> 00:55:32,240
narrow down price doing something in

1001
00:55:32,240 --> 00:55:35,559
here so now that we have the 50% we know

1002
00:55:35,559 --> 00:55:37,640
that we're looking for price to come and

1003
00:55:37,640 --> 00:55:41,720
tap into anything below this the 50% so

1004
00:55:41,720 --> 00:55:45,520
now when we open up the 50% and we look

1005
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,960
what do we see we see the snd here

1006
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:53,280
responsible for breaking structure here

1007
00:55:53,280 --> 00:55:58,680
so now likely area 50% of our swing this

1008
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,039
within here is the snd responsible for

1009
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:03,559
breaking the structure up here we also

1010
00:56:03,559 --> 00:56:06,400
have an imbalance here as well multiple

1011
00:56:06,400 --> 00:56:10,160
imbalances below which makes this area

1012
00:56:10,160 --> 00:56:11,920
likely for price to come down and

1013
00:56:11,920 --> 00:56:15,039
mitigate as well imbalance just below it

1014
00:56:15,039 --> 00:56:18,319
mitigated also so we're not necessarily

1015
00:56:18,319 --> 00:56:20,799
looking for price to come below this

1016
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,920
area but we found this

1017
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,440
area from

1018
00:56:26,440 --> 00:56:31,319
our swing point the

1019
00:56:31,319 --> 00:56:34,760
50% and refined within the 50% of That

1020
00:56:34,760 --> 00:56:35,640
Swing

1021
00:56:35,640 --> 00:56:38,200
point the area that's responsible for

1022
00:56:38,200 --> 00:56:40,039
breaking

1023
00:56:40,039 --> 00:56:43,599
structure so now this becomes the area

1024
00:56:43,599 --> 00:56:47,880
we're looking for but one would ask we

1025
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:49,760
have a bunch of imbalances how do we

1026
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:52,039
know price won't tap into any of these

1027
00:56:52,039 --> 00:56:56,119
areas it's a great question

1028
00:56:56,119 --> 00:56:59,520
price can tap into these areas but guess

1029
00:56:59,520 --> 00:57:03,480
what these areas would overall end up

1030
00:57:03,480 --> 00:57:06,280
being it would end up being a reaction

1031
00:57:06,280 --> 00:57:08,920
at this imbalance a reaction at this

1032
00:57:08,920 --> 00:57:12,200
imbalance a reaction at this imbalance a

1033
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:14,839
reaction at this imbalance until we get

1034
00:57:14,839 --> 00:57:17,640
to the targeted area and then we reverse

1035
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,400
from

1036
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:23,079
here so now as pric is Shifting back

1037
00:57:23,079 --> 00:57:25,640
down to our swing point

1038
00:57:25,640 --> 00:57:27,920
because the larger swing points are the

1039
00:57:27,920 --> 00:57:31,000
likely swing points that price will come

1040
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,920
tap into in Reverse now as price is

1041
00:57:33,920 --> 00:57:36,400
Shifting back down to

1042
00:57:36,400 --> 00:57:38,319
this you'll

1043
00:57:38,319 --> 00:57:42,240
see that you will have multiple

1044
00:57:42,240 --> 00:57:44,359
opportunities to scal this and balance

1045
00:57:44,359 --> 00:57:47,400
up scal this and balance up scal this

1046
00:57:47,400 --> 00:57:50,119
and balance up scalp this imbalance up

1047
00:57:50,119 --> 00:57:52,640
maybe scalp this fractal up scalp this

1048
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:55,599
snd up because we know overall we're in

1049
00:57:55,599 --> 00:57:59,799
our one trade coming back down to here

1050
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:01,839
but we know all of the likely

1051
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,119
reactionary areas that are here for

1052
00:58:05,119 --> 00:58:08,720
price to give us a nice quick pump

1053
00:58:08,720 --> 00:58:12,599
up we're scalping off of

1054
00:58:12,599 --> 00:58:16,599
that as we're coming to our likely area

1055
00:58:16,599 --> 00:58:19,720
for the reversal so this would get rid

1056
00:58:19,720 --> 00:58:23,240
of that mindset that you guys are

1057
00:58:23,240 --> 00:58:26,079
expecting us to

1058
00:58:26,079 --> 00:58:28,119
reverse from here and maybe reverse from

1059
00:58:28,119 --> 00:58:29,799
here and maybe reverse from here and

1060
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:31,319
maybe reverse from here and maybe

1061
00:58:31,319 --> 00:58:35,280
reverse from here and maybe reverse from

1062
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:38,440
here we're not expecting reversals no

1063
00:58:38,440 --> 00:58:41,960
longer through here we're expecting

1064
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:45,400
scalps up but not only do we get our

1065
00:58:45,400 --> 00:58:49,119
scalps up as we're coming

1066
00:58:49,119 --> 00:58:51,720
down we

1067
00:58:51,720 --> 00:58:55,359
get the rejection from here

1068
00:58:55,359 --> 00:58:59,720
to here from here to here from here to

1069
00:58:59,720 --> 00:59:03,119
here from here to here from here to here

1070
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:05,760
so any side of the market that you want

1071
00:59:05,760 --> 00:59:06,880
to play

1072
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:10,880
on whether it's a scalp up or a

1073
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:15,400
continuation down you see it all

1074
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:18,160
happening and the areas that it happens

1075
00:59:18,160 --> 00:59:22,680
in is the zones that you're looking to

1076
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,400
to trade from but the those are only

1077
00:59:25,400 --> 00:59:27,319
reactionary

1078
00:59:27,319 --> 00:59:30,000
zones the actual Zone that you're

1079
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:34,200
looking to reverse from is just one area

1080
00:59:34,200 --> 00:59:37,960
and any other area that's along here

1081
00:59:37,960 --> 00:59:40,880
you're only looking for a quick Scout

1082
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:43,720
but what I will say is that with the

1083
00:59:43,720 --> 00:59:46,839
imbalances price can often come directly

1084
00:59:46,839 --> 00:59:50,440
to this imbalance right here above never

1085
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:54,839
tap into this snd Zone down here never

1086
00:59:54,839 --> 00:59:55,720
tap

1087
00:59:55,720 --> 00:59:59,400
sorry price can never tap into this here

1088
00:59:59,400 --> 01:00:01,400
but it can tap right into this

1089
01:00:01,400 --> 01:00:04,039
imbalance just above it and then

1090
01:00:04,039 --> 01:00:06,720
continue to put in another high and

1091
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:08,480
smart money and all these people are

1092
01:00:08,480 --> 01:00:11,240
waiting for this old juicy order block

1093
01:00:11,240 --> 01:00:14,720
to come yeah oh hit that area imbalance

1094
01:00:14,720 --> 01:00:16,839
gets tapped and it

1095
01:00:16,839 --> 01:00:20,319
goes that's where the IM balances become

1096
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,000
game game changers for you and this is

1097
01:00:23,000 --> 01:00:26,359
why I mentioned that areas that are

1098
01:00:26,359 --> 01:00:29,400
likely because price broke structure

1099
01:00:29,400 --> 01:00:31,960
from that area choose the imbalance

1100
01:00:31,960 --> 01:00:33,880
that's there because it could reverse at

1101
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:37,799
the imbalance and not the snd and

1102
01:00:37,799 --> 01:00:40,079
sometimes it will reverse at the snd but

1103
01:00:40,079 --> 01:00:42,000
there are times where it will not go

1104
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:43,960
back to that snd it would just hit the

1105
01:00:43,960 --> 01:00:45,880
imbalance directly look like look it did

1106
01:00:45,880 --> 01:00:47,359
it right here

1107
01:00:47,359 --> 01:00:52,440
sorry look at this right here this area

1108
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:55,160
here was responsible for breaking

1109
01:00:55,160 --> 01:00:57,599
structure here price came and tapped

1110
01:00:57,599 --> 01:01:00,880
this imbalance and continued up and all

1111
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:03,400
these other people who who love to play

1112
01:01:03,400 --> 01:01:06,000
order blocks and all that other stuff

1113
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:07,880
never got a

1114
01:01:07,880 --> 01:01:10,240
tap never got a tap into it oh we

1115
01:01:10,240 --> 01:01:11,640
waiting for price to tap into the demand

1116
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:13,839
area never ta there what did it hit the

1117
01:01:13,839 --> 01:01:15,280
imbalance directly

1118
01:01:15,280 --> 01:01:19,720
above so we want to look to get involved

1119
01:01:19,720 --> 01:01:22,799
on most of these moves as they can turn

1120
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:26,319
into just a quick Scout for you and

1121
01:01:26,319 --> 01:01:28,240
often times never come back down here

1122
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,039
and end up being a longer move that

1123
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:32,480
you're taking up so you want to get used

1124
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:35,799
to understand the reactions that are in

1125
01:01:35,799 --> 01:01:39,359
these areas and how to capitalize on

1126
01:01:39,359 --> 01:01:43,319
them and because they are

1127
01:01:43,319 --> 01:01:47,799
reactions that that are um uh uh because

1128
01:01:47,799 --> 01:01:51,400
these these reactions are are uh uh you

1129
01:01:51,400 --> 01:01:53,400
know like you're you're kind of playing

1130
01:01:53,400 --> 01:01:55,839
them in terms of of when they tap in and

1131
01:01:55,839 --> 01:01:56,799
they

1132
01:01:56,799 --> 01:02:00,440
go you can capitalize on each and every

1133
01:02:00,440 --> 01:02:03,119
one of those being precise with your

1134
01:02:03,119 --> 01:02:05,720
risk management so if you tap into the

1135
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:09,680
50% of this area because it's a likely

1136
01:02:09,680 --> 01:02:12,640
area you may be able to risk a little

1137
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:16,359
more on it risk 10% 15% on it because

1138
01:02:16,359 --> 01:02:18,400
you see that these reactions off of

1139
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,079
these areas tend to be very very sure

1140
01:02:21,079 --> 01:02:25,200
and very very powerful but with the

1141
01:02:25,200 --> 01:02:28,440
imbalances what I will say is that with

1142
01:02:28,440 --> 01:02:31,039
the imbalances on the higher time frames

1143
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:34,480
price tends to go a little more than the

1144
01:02:34,480 --> 01:02:37,799
50% with a lot of these imbalances so

1145
01:02:37,799 --> 01:02:41,640
sometimes price goes 61 68 you know like

1146
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:44,359
within that area 70% even and then

1147
01:02:44,359 --> 01:02:47,079
continue up so you have to be able to

1148
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:50,799
brace yourself for some of the draw down

1149
01:02:50,799 --> 01:02:55,480
that you could be in if there's any

1150
01:02:55,480 --> 01:02:57,160
you have to brace yourself for some of

1151
01:02:57,160 --> 01:02:59,760
that draw down and that's where risk

1152
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,599
management is important because charting

1153
01:03:02,599 --> 01:03:04,160
is not the only thing that that's

1154
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,760
important in profitability risk

1155
01:03:05,760 --> 01:03:07,400
management is actually the thing that

1156
01:03:07,400 --> 01:03:09,960
creates profitability because you you

1157
01:03:09,960 --> 01:03:13,000
create some sort of system within your

1158
01:03:13,000 --> 01:03:16,720
scalping that you're able to take

1159
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:20,920
certain calculated risk and you're able

1160
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:23,520
to make you know small portions of money

1161
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:26,839
let me see I end up holding uh end up

1162
01:03:26,839 --> 01:03:28,880
holding a lot of my scalps too long and

1163
01:03:28,880 --> 01:03:31,119
it retraces on me yeah that that's true

1164
01:03:31,119 --> 01:03:33,599
how how do you decide to hold for larger

1165
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:37,119
moves versus it's just a scalp um like

1166
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,000
what changed your bias from a scalp to a

1167
01:03:39,000 --> 01:03:41,160
longer move what changes my bias from a

1168
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,319
scalp to a longer move is a structural

1169
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:48,799
break because let's say let's say this

1170
01:03:48,799 --> 01:03:51,119
turned into a scalp here like this was

1171
01:03:51,119 --> 01:03:54,720
my scalp here my quick scalp up you know

1172
01:03:54,720 --> 01:03:57,079
price trades up

1173
01:03:57,079 --> 01:04:01,160
here price comes back into this area you

1174
01:04:01,160 --> 01:04:03,039
know I'm I'm in from down here so I

1175
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,200
don't really care what's going on here

1176
01:04:05,200 --> 01:04:07,279
but as price continues to go and you

1177
01:04:07,279 --> 01:04:09,880
start to see structure breaking sorry

1178
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:12,039
you start to see structure breaking to

1179
01:04:12,039 --> 01:04:14,880
the top side you're not getting out of

1180
01:04:14,880 --> 01:04:18,400
this because you know at the end of the

1181
01:04:18,400 --> 01:04:20,839
day price is only coming back to this

1182
01:04:20,839 --> 01:04:23,200
swing

1183
01:04:23,200 --> 01:04:25,599
point

1184
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:28,039
and price will tap into the swing point

1185
01:04:28,039 --> 01:04:31,279
and then take you higher which this is

1186
01:04:31,279 --> 01:04:33,520
exactly what it did you guys see

1187
01:04:33,520 --> 01:04:36,559
this this candle this green candle with

1188
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:40,480
this Wick sent us above the swing

1189
01:04:40,640 --> 01:04:43,240
point this green

1190
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:48,799
candle when we closed we came back into

1191
01:04:48,799 --> 01:04:51,720
the 50% of the Swing

1192
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:55,440
Point tapped in

1193
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:56,640
and we

1194
01:04:56,640 --> 01:04:59,880
left so if this is a bullish Trend

1195
01:04:59,880 --> 01:05:02,279
that's trending it's only coming back to

1196
01:05:02,279 --> 01:05:06,359
particular areas tap into it and go

1197
01:05:06,359 --> 01:05:08,319
because we already broke structure up

1198
01:05:08,319 --> 01:05:10,720
here once we broke structure up here and

1199
01:05:10,720 --> 01:05:12,760
you got in here your stops are at break

1200
01:05:12,760 --> 01:05:15,039
even here but you are expecting some

1201
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:17,640
retracement back into the area after the

1202
01:05:17,640 --> 01:05:20,880
structural break so a lot of the times

1203
01:05:20,880 --> 01:05:22,839
you might be getting

1204
01:05:22,839 --> 01:05:26,559
in you might be scalping from here and

1205
01:05:26,559 --> 01:05:28,119
price goes

1206
01:05:28,119 --> 01:05:31,599
up and then when it goes up above this

1207
01:05:31,599 --> 01:05:34,480
structural High it comes back into the

1208
01:05:34,480 --> 01:05:36,760
area and takes you out at break

1209
01:05:36,760 --> 01:05:40,559
even and then it ends up going above to

1210
01:05:40,559 --> 01:05:43,240
wherever it is that that you thought it

1211
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,480
was going

1212
01:05:44,480 --> 01:05:47,279
to and a lot of the times that's because

1213
01:05:47,279 --> 01:05:49,839
not understanding where you are

1214
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:51,880
structurally and this is why I continue

1215
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,319
to talk about the like under

1216
01:05:54,319 --> 01:05:56,119
understanding structure is very very

1217
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:58,760
important Candlestick structure

1218
01:05:58,760 --> 01:06:01,440
intermediary structure institutional

1219
01:06:01,440 --> 01:06:05,359
structure and utilizing all of it uh

1220
01:06:05,359 --> 01:06:07,079
what would be the confirmation to get

1221
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:10,160
into a tap of the imbalance and not wait

1222
01:06:10,160 --> 01:06:14,279
for liquidity to get to the ob

1223
01:06:14,279 --> 01:06:17,200
um the requirement to get in on the the

1224
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:20,079
top of this imbalance is

1225
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:22,279
that if

1226
01:06:22,279 --> 01:06:26,880
price TAPS in let me let me show you if

1227
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,680
price Taps into this imbalance and

1228
01:06:30,680 --> 01:06:34,119
shifts above the

1229
01:06:34,119 --> 01:06:37,359
area you want to see price come back

1230
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:40,880
into this area that's above the

1231
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:44,079
imbalance tap here you want to see it

1232
01:06:44,079 --> 01:06:48,559
come back into the the 50% of the area

1233
01:06:48,559 --> 01:06:51,559
this is a swing here this one

1234
01:06:51,559 --> 01:06:54,319
candle this one candle is a swing swing

1235
01:06:54,319 --> 01:06:58,680
on Candlestick structure so this candle

1236
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:01,799
actually created the well the imbalance

1237
01:07:01,799 --> 01:07:04,559
actually created the swing because price

1238
01:07:04,559 --> 01:07:06,960
shifted down tapped the imbalance and

1239
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:10,079
then swung it up so this imbalance

1240
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:14,079
created a swing and all we did was take

1241
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:15,119
that

1242
01:07:15,119 --> 01:07:18,279
swing and when price trades above it

1243
01:07:18,279 --> 01:07:20,559
we're expecting price to come back into

1244
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:24,200
it which that's exactly what it did here

1245
01:07:24,200 --> 01:07:27,400
if you guys look tapped right back into

1246
01:07:27,400 --> 01:07:29,799
the center of this one candle because

1247
01:07:29,799 --> 01:07:32,440
this one candle is the swing came out of

1248
01:07:32,440 --> 01:07:36,359
the Swing tapped back into it

1249
01:07:36,359 --> 01:07:40,039
here and then traded

1250
01:07:40,039 --> 01:07:42,720
higher

1251
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:45,440
so so this is why understanding the

1252
01:07:45,440 --> 01:07:46,960
different types of

1253
01:07:46,960 --> 01:07:50,599
structure can help you to get into

1254
01:07:50,599 --> 01:07:54,359
trades before you know smart money is

1255
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:56,559
waiting down here for their little order

1256
01:07:56,559 --> 01:08:00,480
block Taps ICT Bros are waiting here to

1257
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:02,160
get into an entry and they can't and

1258
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:05,039
they go oh ICT doesn't work you know or

1259
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:07,279
this doesn't work and that doesn't work

1260
01:08:07,279 --> 01:08:08,920
and a lot of the times they just don't

1261
01:08:08,920 --> 01:08:12,480
really understand you know like like how

1262
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,200
price moves how how the algorithm moves

1263
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,839
and they end up getting caught out there

1264
01:08:16,839 --> 01:08:20,839
like this you know so um you can utilize

1265
01:08:20,839 --> 01:08:25,359
swing points but not just that

1266
01:08:25,359 --> 01:08:27,759
not just that

1267
01:08:27,759 --> 01:08:31,839
guys swing points work on higher time

1268
01:08:31,839 --> 01:08:34,439
frames so this is the one-h hour time

1269
01:08:34,439 --> 01:08:37,158
frame if I take this swing low to this

1270
01:08:37,158 --> 01:08:38,238
swing

1271
01:08:38,238 --> 01:08:42,080
High when price traded below it we had

1272
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:44,880
price try to come back up and trade it

1273
01:08:44,880 --> 01:08:48,359
down but we had this area still

1274
01:08:48,359 --> 01:08:52,158
mitigated from the one hour so if we

1275
01:08:52,158 --> 01:08:55,799
wanted to catch a high higher time frame

1276
01:08:55,799 --> 01:08:58,560
reversal we would have chosen a higher

1277
01:08:58,560 --> 01:09:02,080
time frame swing point and not just that

1278
01:09:02,080 --> 01:09:04,040
remember with the higher time frame

1279
01:09:04,040 --> 01:09:06,920
swing points what we're looking to do is

1280
01:09:06,920 --> 01:09:09,439
get in at the 50% and our stops are

1281
01:09:09,439 --> 01:09:13,880
behind here but this is a lot of risk so

1282
01:09:13,880 --> 01:09:18,198
what I do is I take the 50% of the Swing

1283
01:09:18,198 --> 01:09:21,759
point and I look for a possible area

1284
01:09:21,759 --> 01:09:24,640
within this 50%

1285
01:09:24,640 --> 01:09:27,880
that price could potentially tap into

1286
01:09:27,880 --> 01:09:29,960
and give me some reaction so guess what

1287
01:09:29,960 --> 01:09:32,199
that

1288
01:09:33,880 --> 01:09:36,198
becomes imbalance imbalance imbalance

1289
01:09:36,198 --> 01:09:39,319
imbalance imbalance there's always

1290
01:09:39,319 --> 01:09:42,600
imbalances Within These swing

1291
01:09:42,600 --> 01:09:47,080
points and since imbalances give you the

1292
01:09:47,080 --> 01:09:50,479
stronger Taps out of the area you find

1293
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:53,960
the imbalance that's likely to react

1294
01:09:53,960 --> 01:09:57,280
react from the swing

1295
01:09:57,280 --> 01:10:00,640
point I hope I'm not losing anybody here

1296
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:04,520
so now you take this imbalance and now

1297
01:10:04,520 --> 01:10:08,800
the imbalance becomes your entry and the

1298
01:10:08,800 --> 01:10:11,719
50%

1299
01:10:11,719 --> 01:10:13,920
becomes the where you're where you're

1300
01:10:13,920 --> 01:10:15,960
entering and your risk is directly

1301
01:10:15,960 --> 01:10:17,280
behind the

1302
01:10:17,280 --> 01:10:20,159
zone why not choose the imbalance above

1303
01:10:20,159 --> 01:10:22,920
that one the imbalance above this one

1304
01:10:22,920 --> 01:10:25,920
this is a swing point I'm looking for

1305
01:10:25,920 --> 01:10:30,280
price to tap into the 50% of the Swing

1306
01:10:30,280 --> 01:10:33,199
point or

1307
01:10:33,199 --> 01:10:37,880
above but if you look within

1308
01:10:37,880 --> 01:10:41,679
here there's no

1309
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:45,080
sorry there's no volume up

1310
01:10:45,080 --> 01:10:47,159
here remember how we say price is

1311
01:10:47,159 --> 01:10:48,920
attracted to

1312
01:10:48,920 --> 01:10:53,320
volume there's no volume up here this is

1313
01:10:53,320 --> 01:10:55,679
price going straight up to immediately

1314
01:10:55,679 --> 01:11:00,080
pushing straight down and it left an

1315
01:11:00,080 --> 01:11:03,080
imbalance there's no volume in this top

1316
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:06,400
area where were we consolidating up

1317
01:11:06,400 --> 01:11:10,440
here there's no consolidation here so

1318
01:11:10,440 --> 01:11:12,520
cons consolidation is important because

1319
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:14,880
when that area comes back to be

1320
01:11:14,880 --> 01:11:17,440
tested then you usually get a reaction

1321
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:20,600
out of the area so we consolidate up

1322
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,480
here within this swing point right here

1323
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:27,320
we consolidate within here and then we

1324
01:11:27,320 --> 01:11:30,080
get a tap into the area and we short

1325
01:11:30,080 --> 01:11:33,480
from the Consolidated area from the area

1326
01:11:33,480 --> 01:11:36,560
that has volume so we're choosing this

1327
01:11:36,560 --> 01:11:40,040
imbalance here knowing that up here

1328
01:11:40,040 --> 01:11:43,000
there's no volume there and most people

1329
01:11:43,000 --> 01:11:45,239
are using these volume indicators and

1330
01:11:45,239 --> 01:11:47,280
they're like oh if price goes I don't

1331
01:11:47,280 --> 01:11:48,719
know let let me see if I could find that

1332
01:11:48,719 --> 01:11:50,400
volume indicator that people are using

1333
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:54,320
right now it's like a a huge Trend um

1334
01:11:54,320 --> 01:11:58,360
uh that that people are using

1335
01:11:59,920 --> 01:12:02,800
um it's like uh

1336
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:05,480
uh I don't even know how they how they

1337
01:12:05,480 --> 01:12:08,639
would they would capture this maybe it's

1338
01:12:08,639 --> 01:12:12,480
the last swing or something like

1339
01:12:12,920 --> 01:12:15,120
that let me

1340
01:12:15,120 --> 01:12:18,280
see maybe it's here who knows yeah I

1341
01:12:18,280 --> 01:12:20,239
don't know I don't I don't see well the

1342
01:12:20,239 --> 01:12:21,800
volume indicator is showing that the

1343
01:12:21,800 --> 01:12:24,120
volume is here

1344
01:12:24,120 --> 01:12:26,520
so people are utilizing this volume

1345
01:12:26,520 --> 01:12:28,880
indicator with these

1346
01:12:28,880 --> 01:12:32,320
swings to find out where the volume is

1347
01:12:32,320 --> 01:12:34,199
and where price potentially May react

1348
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:37,239
from when you can already see the volume

1349
01:12:37,239 --> 01:12:40,080
with your own

1350
01:12:40,080 --> 01:12:43,080
eye you can see the volume with your own

1351
01:12:43,080 --> 01:12:45,560
eyes because the imbalance chosen is in

1352
01:12:45,560 --> 01:12:49,239
the 50% area yeah exactly that's why the

1353
01:12:49,239 --> 01:12:51,920
the imbalance that I chose is at the

1354
01:12:51,920 --> 01:12:54,560
50% where usually looking for price to

1355
01:12:54,560 --> 01:12:57,880
react at the 50% sometimes price can go

1356
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:00,679
a little further up within it but we're

1357
01:13:00,679 --> 01:13:02,920
looking more so for price to react at

1358
01:13:02,920 --> 01:13:09,159
the 50% so we take the area at that 50%

1359
01:13:09,159 --> 01:13:13,159
and utilize that as the most likely area

1360
01:13:13,159 --> 01:13:15,760
for price to reverse from and that's

1361
01:13:15,760 --> 01:13:19,120
just on the swing

1362
01:13:19,120 --> 01:13:22,120
point so usually you want to make sure

1363
01:13:22,120 --> 01:13:24,600
that within that area there's also some

1364
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:27,639
volume there because we know that price

1365
01:13:27,639 --> 01:13:29,600
is attracted to volume and now you no

1366
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:32,120
longer have to use this little volume

1367
01:13:32,120 --> 01:13:35,320
indicator to tell you where volume is or

1368
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:36,719
you know there are people who are like

1369
01:13:36,719 --> 01:13:39,199
creating strategies off of it where you

1370
01:13:39,199 --> 01:13:41,760
know they're like if price goes above it

1371
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:43,679
and once it comes back below it you get

1372
01:13:43,679 --> 01:13:47,159
into a short I have no idea what what

1373
01:13:47,159 --> 01:13:49,120
any of that stuff is and and how

1374
01:13:49,120 --> 01:13:51,199
beneficial any of those things are like

1375
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:53,520
there there's I would never endorse that

1376
01:13:53,520 --> 01:13:56,280
at all because what what's the structure

1377
01:13:56,280 --> 01:13:59,120
behind that you know like what like they

1378
01:13:59,120 --> 01:14:01,480
would have it go up above here and they

1379
01:14:01,480 --> 01:14:05,520
would place a sell stop right below here

1380
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,159
and they would wait for price to tap

1381
01:14:07,159 --> 01:14:10,840
them in and take them down below

1382
01:14:10,840 --> 01:14:15,120
here and you know they they would take

1383
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:20,080
that momentum entry below this volume

1384
01:14:20,080 --> 01:14:21,880
part whatever this is called cuz I don't

1385
01:14:21,880 --> 01:14:23,880
use this indicator so I don't know like

1386
01:14:23,880 --> 01:14:27,280
where the most volume is they'll

1387
01:14:27,280 --> 01:14:30,800
take the entry here when it comes below

1388
01:14:30,800 --> 01:14:32,920
that area so I've I've been seeing

1389
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,880
people utilize this to trade with but I

1390
01:14:35,880 --> 01:14:38,159
still think that you can find the volume

1391
01:14:38,159 --> 01:14:40,120
just using your eyes you don't

1392
01:14:40,120 --> 01:14:43,239
necessarily need to um use an indicator

1393
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:45,400
to help you spot that because you can

1394
01:14:45,400 --> 01:14:47,560
already see the volume just in the

1395
01:14:47,560 --> 01:14:49,760
clustered areas the areas that are

1396
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:53,639
Consolidated that's the volume areas uh

1397
01:14:53,639 --> 01:14:55,679
Crystal Clear that's great uh this is

1398
01:14:55,679 --> 01:14:57,520
what many Traders would

1399
01:14:57,520 --> 01:15:02,560
call buy to sell candle or sell to buy

1400
01:15:02,560 --> 01:15:07,080
candle um or institutional candle 50% of

1401
01:15:07,080 --> 01:15:09,800
that last candle that caused the break I

1402
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,520
back tested this on trading view at the

1403
01:15:12,520 --> 01:15:14,760
second top of the 50% you barely get

1404
01:15:14,760 --> 01:15:17,040
caught in draw down exactly yeah you

1405
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:19,920
barely get caught in draw down

1406
01:15:19,920 --> 01:15:24,639
barely you know because of taing into

1407
01:15:24,639 --> 01:15:27,320
that that area but then you also have to

1408
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:31,239
know that sometimes those areas are not

1409
01:15:31,239 --> 01:15:34,320
touched like the the the smaller swing

1410
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:36,639
points we try to choose the small the

1411
01:15:36,639 --> 01:15:39,239
smallest swing points for for price to

1412
01:15:39,239 --> 01:15:41,600
react off of let let's say we chose this

1413
01:15:41,600 --> 01:15:45,560
swing Point down here right

1414
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:51,000
here right here we had price go above it

1415
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:52,800
so if you put your stop directly above

1416
01:15:52,800 --> 01:15:54,120
the swing swing point you would have

1417
01:15:54,120 --> 01:15:56,360
just been taken out and then we had a

1418
01:15:56,360 --> 01:15:58,719
reaction

1419
01:15:58,719 --> 01:16:01,000
down you know but this swing Point

1420
01:16:01,000 --> 01:16:03,239
wasn't a swing point that gave you a

1421
01:16:03,239 --> 01:16:05,760
clean rejection and took you down so if

1422
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,800
you utilize the wrong swing points as

1423
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:11,520
well often times you could end up

1424
01:16:11,520 --> 01:16:15,360
becoming you know mixed meat and you

1425
01:16:15,360 --> 01:16:17,920
want to utilize the swing points that

1426
01:16:17,920 --> 01:16:22,320
are in areas that have volume to it

1427
01:16:22,320 --> 01:16:26,600
areas that have volume to it you want to

1428
01:16:26,600 --> 01:16:29,120
use those swing points so with this

1429
01:16:29,120 --> 01:16:31,960
swing point we wouldn't necessarily be

1430
01:16:31,960 --> 01:16:33,480
using this

1431
01:16:33,480 --> 01:16:37,159
here but we would also look to maybe

1432
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:39,480
spot something above like an imbalance

1433
01:16:39,480 --> 01:16:42,600
or fractal or or something above here so

1434
01:16:42,600 --> 01:16:45,560
I think this is a fractal tap here which

1435
01:16:45,560 --> 01:16:49,880
also is this um snd here this hidden snd

1436
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,080
back here right

1437
01:16:52,080 --> 01:16:55,080
here

1438
01:16:56,639 --> 01:16:59,480
yeah it's hitting snd here so price

1439
01:16:59,480 --> 01:17:03,760
usually Taps into it rejects out of it

1440
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:06,560
let's let me just move this price

1441
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:08,800
usually Taps into it rejects out of it

1442
01:17:08,800 --> 01:17:12,360
and then liquidates it so it looks like

1443
01:17:12,360 --> 01:17:13,040
let me

1444
01:17:13,040 --> 01:17:16,649
[Music]

1445
01:17:22,000 --> 01:17:24,840
see

1446
01:17:24,840 --> 01:17:26,719
oh it didn't even liquidate

1447
01:17:26,719 --> 01:17:32,280
it it came really close and then shifted

1448
01:17:33,679 --> 01:17:36,760
down yeah it didn't even liquidate

1449
01:17:36,760 --> 01:17:39,560
it actually I'm wondering oh no no no no

1450
01:17:39,560 --> 01:17:42,280
no this wait is this no I'm tripping

1451
01:17:42,280 --> 01:17:44,520
it's not thinking this was the news the

1452
01:17:44,520 --> 01:17:46,080
other

1453
01:17:46,080 --> 01:17:49,480
day on uh on June

1454
01:17:49,480 --> 01:17:51,719
28th because we had that huge pushup

1455
01:17:51,719 --> 01:17:54,560
followed by that push down

1456
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:59,120
um oh no this is news

1457
01:18:01,679 --> 01:18:04,199
right yeah this was news or something

1458
01:18:04,199 --> 01:18:05,239
like

1459
01:18:05,239 --> 01:18:08,280
that we were talking about this this

1460
01:18:08,280 --> 01:18:10,560
area and then probably shift it down for

1461
01:18:10,560 --> 01:18:12,440
the rest of the

1462
01:18:12,440 --> 01:18:16,600
day yeah yeah that was news that was

1463
01:18:16,600 --> 01:18:18,800
news oh no it was this I'm sorry I'm

1464
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:21,880
lying look at me over here telling the

1465
01:18:21,880 --> 01:18:24,400
truth about the go to

1466
01:18:24,400 --> 01:18:28,560
hell I'm kidding so yeah the the swing

1467
01:18:28,560 --> 01:18:31,480
points um let me see after I stop us

1468
01:18:31,480 --> 01:18:33,639
indicator I feel more secure off my

1469
01:18:33,639 --> 01:18:35,320
trades yeah and if you utilize these

1470
01:18:35,320 --> 01:18:37,440
swing points as areas to scalp you could

1471
01:18:37,440 --> 01:18:39,679
certainly just you know impact your

1472
01:18:39,679 --> 01:18:42,600
trading um in terms of like scalping

1473
01:18:42,600 --> 01:18:46,080
those 10 20 Pips make 10 Pips your hard

1474
01:18:46,080 --> 01:18:49,360
partial or 20 Pips you're hard partial

1475
01:18:49,360 --> 01:18:52,120
so it creates this discipline that

1476
01:18:52,120 --> 01:18:54,239
you're out intend 10 out and 10 out and

1477
01:18:54,239 --> 01:18:56,840
10 out and 10 out and 10 so for every

1478
01:18:56,840 --> 01:18:59,920
trade that you take now with us30 it's

1479
01:18:59,920 --> 01:19:01,719
going to be more than 10 Pips with those

1480
01:19:01,719 --> 01:19:03,440
reactions because we see how heavy those

1481
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,679
are but it'll just be out in 10 out and

1482
01:19:05,679 --> 01:19:08,000
10 out and 10 or partial at 20 partial

1483
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:10,159
at 20 partial at 20 partial at 20 and

1484
01:19:10,159 --> 01:19:13,679
when you get used to it then you'll see

1485
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,400
that okay now I could up my risk a

1486
01:19:16,400 --> 01:19:19,280
little more now I could hold a little

1487
01:19:19,280 --> 01:19:22,400
more and as I'm holding a little more

1488
01:19:22,400 --> 01:19:25,560
I'm able ble to be confident in my trade

1489
01:19:25,560 --> 01:19:28,080
and maybe add in a second position or

1490
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,360
maybe take a scalp from this area back

1491
01:19:30,360 --> 01:19:31,719
down but I know we're not going all the

1492
01:19:31,719 --> 01:19:33,760
way down we're just retracing to here

1493
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,400
and I could stay in this trade right

1494
01:19:36,400 --> 01:19:40,400
here and head back up you can only spot

1495
01:19:40,400 --> 01:19:42,760
those things and understand those things

1496
01:19:42,760 --> 01:19:46,600
when you are using structure so I'm

1497
01:19:46,600 --> 01:19:48,440
teaching you guys about these swing

1498
01:19:48,440 --> 01:19:51,679
points but I also want you guys to

1499
01:19:51,679 --> 01:19:54,719
understand that that with these swing

1500
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:57,880
points you need to know structure so

1501
01:19:57,880 --> 01:20:00,320
this area we tapped into this area I

1502
01:20:00,320 --> 01:20:02,000
think this area was like called out on

1503
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,440
stream or something like that or right

1504
01:20:03,440 --> 01:20:06,320
before stream we tapped into this area

1505
01:20:06,320 --> 01:20:08,440
and I had mentioned that we were coming

1506
01:20:08,440 --> 01:20:12,120
down here what did I see down here when

1507
01:20:12,120 --> 01:20:16,400
we came down this tiny swing point from

1508
01:20:16,400 --> 01:20:18,600
across the

1509
01:20:18,600 --> 01:20:23,080
way and if you look within this larger

1510
01:20:23,080 --> 01:20:24,159
Point

1511
01:20:24,159 --> 01:20:28,239
here price traded above it came back and

1512
01:20:28,239 --> 01:20:31,960
mitigated it and then traded

1513
01:20:31,960 --> 01:20:36,120
higher but we have an area below a

1514
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,880
demand area that was created below that

1515
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:41,560
went untested went

1516
01:20:41,560 --> 01:20:45,560
unmitigated so we had news happen that

1517
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:50,280
took us all the way down here to tap

1518
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,199
into our area our

1519
01:20:54,199 --> 01:20:57,040
swing the last swing before price

1520
01:20:57,040 --> 01:20:59,600
shifted to the top side why is this

1521
01:20:59,600 --> 01:21:03,000
swing important also yes we got a tap at

1522
01:21:03,000 --> 01:21:04,639
the middle of this swing and we got

1523
01:21:04,639 --> 01:21:09,040
pushed up but this swing is way more

1524
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:11,760
important why because this is the snd

1525
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,199
that broke structure to the top

1526
01:21:14,199 --> 01:21:17,440
side so regardless of the Swing we still

1527
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:20,159
have to come back to mitigate the snd

1528
01:21:20,159 --> 01:21:21,840
responsible for breaking structure to

1529
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,000
the top side

1530
01:21:24,000 --> 01:21:26,159
and often times those little tiny

1531
01:21:26,159 --> 01:21:28,920
mitigated areas that are left behind are

1532
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:31,920
usually areas that the news trades to

1533
01:21:31,920 --> 01:21:35,520
and bounces off of heavy and most people

1534
01:21:35,520 --> 01:21:38,440
just are not aware of the little areas

1535
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:40,159
that are here that are left behind and

1536
01:21:40,159 --> 01:21:44,360
not knowing how they potentially are

1537
01:21:44,520 --> 01:21:46,719
used so most people might have been

1538
01:21:46,719 --> 01:21:49,360
jumping into a sell to come below here

1539
01:21:49,360 --> 01:21:51,840
but this is a swing that was responsible

1540
01:21:51,840 --> 01:21:54,639
for breaking structure the swing was

1541
01:21:54,639 --> 01:21:56,960
responsible for breaking structure the

1542
01:21:56,960 --> 01:21:59,400
swing was responsible for breaking

1543
01:21:59,400 --> 01:22:03,600
structure so we came back to the swing

1544
01:22:03,600 --> 01:22:06,360
that was responsible for breaking

1545
01:22:06,360 --> 01:22:09,400
structure last mitigated last area that

1546
01:22:09,400 --> 01:22:10,600
needed to be

1547
01:22:10,600 --> 01:22:15,040
mitigated before we assume trading

1548
01:22:15,040 --> 01:22:18,120
higher and that's why we tapped into

1549
01:22:18,120 --> 01:22:22,159
this area here and went bullish so guess

1550
01:22:22,159 --> 01:22:23,280
what

1551
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:26,840
what areas are we potentially looking

1552
01:22:26,840 --> 01:22:31,960
into to go long from and in the event

1553
01:22:31,960 --> 01:22:34,520
that there's chaotic news or anything

1554
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,639
like that that happens but the market is

1555
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:41,679
not shifting barish guess where our next

1556
01:22:41,679 --> 01:22:47,199
high impact news event will take

1557
01:22:48,159 --> 01:22:51,960
us snd left behind that was responsible

1558
01:22:51,960 --> 01:22:55,239
for the struggle stru will break

1559
01:22:55,800 --> 01:22:59,679
above and after Biden crashes the stock

1560
01:22:59,679 --> 01:23:02,080
market you know like everybody says

1561
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,080
these

1562
01:23:03,080 --> 01:23:05,800
days then you start to see some normaly

1563
01:23:05,800 --> 01:23:07,760
heading back up it's like yeah we're

1564
01:23:07,760 --> 01:23:11,239
rallying again oh my God we're doing

1565
01:23:11,239 --> 01:23:14,120
great and they just don't understand how

1566
01:23:14,120 --> 01:23:16,639
structure

1567
01:23:17,040 --> 01:23:21,480
works so that's me teaching with swing

1568
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:24,719
points it goes even more in depth with

1569
01:23:24,719 --> 01:23:28,040
these swing points by the way guys

1570
01:23:28,040 --> 01:23:32,239
um because there are ways to know which

1571
01:23:32,239 --> 01:23:35,000
swing points will get liquidated

1572
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:39,679
entirely so often times price has one

1573
01:23:39,679 --> 01:23:43,199
swing Point here and it leaves another

1574
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:45,320
swing point above

1575
01:23:45,320 --> 01:23:49,840
here and if it fails to make a third

1576
01:23:49,840 --> 01:23:53,120
swing point up here

1577
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:54,719
a lot of the times you'll have price

1578
01:23:54,719 --> 01:23:57,880
come tap back into this

1579
01:23:57,880 --> 01:24:01,159
area give you your pump up but we failed

1580
01:24:01,159 --> 01:24:03,920
to make the other high and when we

1581
01:24:03,920 --> 01:24:06,800
failed to make the other high we're just

1582
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,040
liquidating the second swing point that

1583
01:24:10,040 --> 01:24:12,679
formed to take us back to the first

1584
01:24:12,679 --> 01:24:15,000
swing

1585
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,760
point and then the first swing

1586
01:24:17,760 --> 01:24:19,840
point is

1587
01:24:19,840 --> 01:24:23,440
where we end up actually going long to

1588
01:24:23,440 --> 01:24:25,080
put in more

1589
01:24:25,080 --> 01:24:27,560
Highs but since a lot of people don't

1590
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:30,280
understand how all of this kind of works

1591
01:24:30,280 --> 01:24:32,840
together um they're usually tripped up

1592
01:24:32,840 --> 01:24:35,120
in these swings you know trying to find

1593
01:24:35,120 --> 01:24:36,639
the bullish area trying to find the

1594
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:38,960
bearish area trying to find a trend and

1595
01:24:38,960 --> 01:24:41,159
this and that and and if you just

1596
01:24:41,159 --> 01:24:43,960
understand how these areas are

1597
01:24:43,960 --> 01:24:47,840
utilized most people think that you take

1598
01:24:47,840 --> 01:24:51,800
the high here I mean the low here to you

1599
01:24:51,800 --> 01:24:55,199
know the high here maybe

1600
01:24:55,199 --> 01:24:58,000
and you're looking to maybe come back

1601
01:24:58,000 --> 01:25:01,600
into sorry not the main this is actually

1602
01:25:01,600 --> 01:25:05,440
let me just move all of

1603
01:25:08,639 --> 01:25:12,440
this so they go

1604
01:25:13,080 --> 01:25:17,159
here and they'll take this

1605
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:21,199
here sorry default and they're looking

1606
01:25:21,199 --> 01:25:23,440
for price to come back to this

1607
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:26,000
area

1608
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,400
here and

1609
01:25:28,400 --> 01:25:32,239
there's this swing

1610
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:36,400
here and within this

1611
01:25:36,400 --> 01:25:39,400
swing

1612
01:25:41,880 --> 01:25:44,560
there's this swing

1613
01:25:44,560 --> 01:25:47,719
here but being that we understood that

1614
01:25:47,719 --> 01:25:51,280
this this fractal right

1615
01:25:51,280 --> 01:25:54,199
here mitigated

1616
01:25:54,199 --> 01:25:58,000
this what you may end up getting is

1617
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,800
price coming to tap this fractal because

1618
01:26:00,800 --> 01:26:03,840
now this fractal becomes the demand Zone

1619
01:26:03,840 --> 01:26:06,480
the the area that's responsible for

1620
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:08,520
mitigating the demand Zone becomes the

1621
01:26:08,520 --> 01:26:11,840
new demand zone so this becomes the new

1622
01:26:11,840 --> 01:26:15,239
unmitigated demand Zone and within this

1623
01:26:15,239 --> 01:26:20,440
swing here we have two areas we have

1624
01:26:20,440 --> 01:26:23,280
this area here

1625
01:26:23,280 --> 01:26:25,360
that's responsible for the structural

1626
01:26:25,360 --> 01:26:27,800
break

1627
01:26:28,320 --> 01:26:32,199
here and then we also have this area

1628
01:26:32,199 --> 01:26:35,760
here that's responsible

1629
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:39,119
for even this you know this structural

1630
01:26:39,119 --> 01:26:42,400
break this multiple structural

1631
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,480
breaks so if price ends up coming back

1632
01:26:45,480 --> 01:26:48,760
down it can tap into this area not even

1633
01:26:48,760 --> 01:26:51,440
go back to this or even tap into the

1634
01:26:51,440 --> 01:26:52,840
middle of this

1635
01:26:52,840 --> 01:26:55,800
and then assume to put in a new high

1636
01:26:55,800 --> 01:26:58,719
because this is the last unmitigated

1637
01:26:58,719 --> 01:27:02,239
area specifically this fractal being the

1638
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:06,159
last unmitigated area for price to

1639
01:27:06,159 --> 01:27:07,760
continue to trade

1640
01:27:07,760 --> 01:27:10,600
higher because we broke this structure

1641
01:27:10,600 --> 01:27:13,080
we came down and mitigated it we broke

1642
01:27:13,080 --> 01:27:15,920
this structure we did not mitigate it so

1643
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,480
this is still outstanding right here but

1644
01:27:19,480 --> 01:27:22,520
we can potentially have a tap back into

1645
01:27:22,520 --> 01:27:25,040
this area but then we could also take

1646
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,080
the low of that area tap deeper into the

1647
01:27:28,080 --> 01:27:31,000
area and then actually take the high out

1648
01:27:31,000 --> 01:27:33,719
of there but this is just essentially

1649
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:37,520
showing you guys areas on how to spot

1650
01:27:37,520 --> 01:27:40,400
reversals how to spot reversals in real

1651
01:27:40,400 --> 01:27:45,560
time utilizing swing points so now these

1652
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,760
be you you leave out Wicks when defining

1653
01:27:47,760 --> 01:27:52,400
swing zones only Wicks that go below um

1654
01:27:52,400 --> 01:27:56,840
below a particular low so if you look at

1655
01:27:56,840 --> 01:27:59,880
this uh this Wick right no is

1656
01:27:59,880 --> 01:28:03,679
it wait let me turn

1657
01:28:04,840 --> 01:28:07,679
this no it's

1658
01:28:07,679 --> 01:28:11,520
not so it's it's only Wicks like this

1659
01:28:11,520 --> 01:28:12,920
right

1660
01:28:12,920 --> 01:28:16,600
here you see this swing Point

1661
01:28:16,600 --> 01:28:20,880
here this swing point from from

1662
01:28:20,880 --> 01:28:26,239
this this Wick here to this Wick here so

1663
01:28:26,239 --> 01:28:28,880
what I've found um and you guys might

1664
01:28:28,880 --> 01:28:31,040
find different results for you or

1665
01:28:31,040 --> 01:28:32,719
different things that you might see

1666
01:28:32,719 --> 01:28:35,159
quicker and and may understand a little

1667
01:28:35,159 --> 01:28:38,560
better um but what I've found is

1668
01:28:38,560 --> 01:28:39,760
remember how I said there's the

1669
01:28:39,760 --> 01:28:42,840
liquidity grab candle where price you

1670
01:28:42,840 --> 01:28:45,560
know goes below a certain low and then

1671
01:28:45,560 --> 01:28:47,080
shifts above

1672
01:28:47,080 --> 01:28:49,960
it and it continues

1673
01:28:49,960 --> 01:28:52,920
up so this candle

1674
01:28:52,920 --> 01:28:56,000
I say we discount the Wix because it

1675
01:28:56,000 --> 01:29:00,280
traded below the previous low here both

1676
01:29:00,280 --> 01:29:01,639
here and

1677
01:29:01,639 --> 01:29:05,800
here it traded below it but then it

1678
01:29:05,800 --> 01:29:10,159
closed back inside of the range of that

1679
01:29:10,159 --> 01:29:13,639
candle so because we traded below it and

1680
01:29:13,639 --> 01:29:16,080
closed back within the range of that

1681
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:19,320
candle this Wick is considered

1682
01:29:19,320 --> 01:29:23,440
manipulation so I'm not using the wick

1683
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:27,159
because that's that's a manipulated move

1684
01:29:27,159 --> 01:29:29,400
it was a manipulated move down before

1685
01:29:29,400 --> 01:29:31,800
price went up they're not looking to

1686
01:29:31,800 --> 01:29:34,679
come back to this move this move shook

1687
01:29:34,679 --> 01:29:36,679
people out of the

1688
01:29:36,679 --> 01:29:39,360
market and it push back up they're not

1689
01:29:39,360 --> 01:29:41,040
looking to come back to the Move That

1690
01:29:41,040 --> 01:29:43,400
Shook people out of the market because

1691
01:29:43,400 --> 01:29:45,080
that would bring them back to break even

1692
01:29:45,080 --> 01:29:48,639
and what profitability is that so the

1693
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:51,880
reason why I discount that is because of

1694
01:29:51,880 --> 01:29:54,400
often times when we come back into the

1695
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:58,239
area after trading above we actually tap

1696
01:29:58,239 --> 01:30:01,719
into the only the 50% without the wick

1697
01:30:01,719 --> 01:30:03,800
and price trades

1698
01:30:03,800 --> 01:30:07,280
above so we're not counting this because

1699
01:30:07,280 --> 01:30:09,880
this is a liquidity grab if we counted

1700
01:30:09,880 --> 01:30:14,239
this with structure then we missed the

1701
01:30:14,239 --> 01:30:17,400
move and we would continue to miss moves

1702
01:30:17,400 --> 01:30:19,000
and then when price comes back to this

1703
01:30:19,000 --> 01:30:21,440
area we try to catch the move here and

1704
01:30:21,440 --> 01:30:23,560
it just rails through the

1705
01:30:23,560 --> 01:30:26,920
area because we missed the actual move

1706
01:30:26,920 --> 01:30:29,719
when the actual move was

1707
01:30:29,719 --> 01:30:34,040
here and it was this fractal that

1708
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:37,360
mitigated this area this swing a fractal

1709
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:38,400
is a

1710
01:30:38,400 --> 01:30:40,679
swing this

1711
01:30:40,679 --> 01:30:44,000
fractal right

1712
01:30:44,159 --> 01:30:47,119
here was the swing that mitigated the

1713
01:30:47,119 --> 01:30:49,719
area and left so now that makes this

1714
01:30:49,719 --> 01:30:51,880
fractal a likely fractal to have a

1715
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,560
reaction

1716
01:30:53,560 --> 01:30:56,639
on you guys understand you know what

1717
01:30:56,639 --> 01:30:58,800
what I'm saying you know I hope I'm not

1718
01:30:58,800 --> 01:31:01,719
losing anybody I know it's it's you know

1719
01:31:01,719 --> 01:31:03,119
a lot of talking I've been doing a lot

1720
01:31:03,119 --> 01:31:07,960
of explaining but this is how you can

1721
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:11,280
find likely areas I got lost on a

1722
01:31:11,280 --> 01:31:15,960
fractal um so in in this in this um

1723
01:31:15,960 --> 01:31:19,199
frequently act section here um there's

1724
01:31:19,199 --> 01:31:21,280
uh some some explanation of fractals

1725
01:31:21,280 --> 01:31:22,480
what are fract

1726
01:31:22,480 --> 01:31:26,159
it's a super quick easy explanation um

1727
01:31:26,159 --> 01:31:29,119
it's about one minute long um and it

1728
01:31:29,119 --> 01:31:31,159
would kind of catch you up to speed on

1729
01:31:31,159 --> 01:31:34,199
that but the fractal is a swing Point

1730
01:31:34,199 --> 01:31:37,360
too it's a down move you see it started

1731
01:31:37,360 --> 01:31:39,040
at this

1732
01:31:39,040 --> 01:31:42,639
Wick a fractal is a swing point on a

1733
01:31:42,639 --> 01:31:47,840
lower time frame a lower time frame so

1734
01:31:47,840 --> 01:31:52,400
it's this here this high after this high

1735
01:31:52,400 --> 01:31:55,719
was put in we short it and put in this

1736
01:31:55,719 --> 01:31:59,360
low and then we left the area so this

1737
01:31:59,360 --> 01:32:02,360
becomes the area Left Behind for price

1738
01:32:02,360 --> 01:32:05,360
to come and tap into because this area

1739
01:32:05,360 --> 01:32:08,320
that was left behind mitigated a

1740
01:32:08,320 --> 01:32:09,840
previous

1741
01:32:09,840 --> 01:32:13,320
area so this becomes the new area for

1742
01:32:13,320 --> 01:32:15,679
you guys to trade

1743
01:32:15,679 --> 01:32:19,520
from and that becomes the new demand

1744
01:32:19,520 --> 01:32:23,000
area below so if we're look to give us

1745
01:32:23,000 --> 01:32:26,360
another like like kick up another leg up

1746
01:32:26,360 --> 01:32:29,920
or or a sizable reaction up we'll get

1747
01:32:29,920 --> 01:32:33,480
one here because this is still

1748
01:32:33,480 --> 01:32:37,000
responsible for the structural break

1749
01:32:37,000 --> 01:32:39,560
here so there can be multiple ones

1750
01:32:39,560 --> 01:32:41,960
that's responsible for different

1751
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:44,239
structural

1752
01:32:44,239 --> 01:32:47,520
breaks because this is a structure

1753
01:32:47,520 --> 01:32:51,400
here this is a intermediary structure

1754
01:32:51,400 --> 01:32:54,320
this is a institutional

1755
01:32:54,320 --> 01:32:57,239
structure this is another type of

1756
01:32:57,239 --> 01:32:59,400
institutional structure from a higher

1757
01:32:59,400 --> 01:33:02,440
time frame this is another type of

1758
01:33:02,440 --> 01:33:04,159
institutional structure from a higher

1759
01:33:04,159 --> 01:33:06,639
time frame so that's why with every

1760
01:33:06,639 --> 01:33:08,760
swing that we have down and back up

1761
01:33:08,760 --> 01:33:10,800
price comes back to tap into it and goes

1762
01:33:10,800 --> 01:33:11,600
back

1763
01:33:11,600 --> 01:33:14,280
up because we're breaking multiple

1764
01:33:14,280 --> 01:33:16,280
structures but we're also returning to

1765
01:33:16,280 --> 01:33:19,040
those areas that are responsible for

1766
01:33:19,040 --> 01:33:21,119
those different types of structures

1767
01:33:21,119 --> 01:33:22,400
being

1768
01:33:22,400 --> 01:33:24,280
broken and that's why we have

1769
01:33:24,280 --> 01:33:25,679
Candlestick structure out to

1770
01:33:25,679 --> 01:33:28,360
intermediary structure out to you know

1771
01:33:28,360 --> 01:33:30,080
overall a major structure out to

1772
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:33,239
institutional structure it all just you

1773
01:33:33,239 --> 01:33:37,040
know vibrates out what time frame do you

1774
01:33:37,040 --> 01:33:40,560
prefer uh swing points um use the 15 if

1775
01:33:40,560 --> 01:33:43,080
you're day trading use a 15 swing

1776
01:33:43,080 --> 01:33:45,280
point if you're day trading just just

1777
01:33:45,280 --> 01:33:46,960
take a 15

1778
01:33:46,960 --> 01:33:49,960
swing and and use that as an area that

1779
01:33:49,960 --> 01:33:51,400
you could potentially get a reaction

1780
01:33:51,400 --> 01:33:54,159
point from you know but the truth is on

1781
01:33:54,159 --> 01:33:55,960
the one minute you could still find

1782
01:33:55,960 --> 01:33:59,159
pretty good swings on the one

1783
01:33:59,639 --> 01:34:03,600
minute where are we

1784
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:14,119
um over

1785
01:34:18,040 --> 01:34:23,480
here so this was coming up

1786
01:34:30,280 --> 01:34:31,840
so look at right

1787
01:34:31,840 --> 01:34:34,960
here this is how I spotted this trade oh

1788
01:34:34,960 --> 01:34:36,639
I'm going to lose all of my stuff I just

1789
01:34:36,639 --> 01:34:38,840
realized I didn't go back to add this

1790
01:34:38,840 --> 01:34:40,960
stuff on the chart but it's cool this is

1791
01:34:40,960 --> 01:34:43,840
a swing Point

1792
01:34:47,320 --> 01:34:50,360
here it's a swing Point here price comes

1793
01:34:50,360 --> 01:34:52,040
and Taps into it but

1794
01:34:52,040 --> 01:34:55,600
but look within here and this is how I

1795
01:34:55,600 --> 01:34:57,600
modify some of my swing points to get a

1796
01:34:57,600 --> 01:35:00,639
more accurate move this is Candlestick

1797
01:35:00,639 --> 01:35:03,080
structure

1798
01:35:03,440 --> 01:35:07,080
now you have this High you have this low

1799
01:35:07,080 --> 01:35:09,360
you have this

1800
01:35:09,360 --> 01:35:12,960
High you have this low you have this

1801
01:35:12,960 --> 01:35:14,920
High you have this

1802
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:18,040
low you have this

1803
01:35:18,040 --> 01:35:20,400
High you have this

1804
01:35:20,400 --> 01:35:22,800
low

1805
01:35:22,800 --> 01:35:25,119
you have this High put

1806
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:29,320
in what are we seeing over here well

1807
01:35:29,320 --> 01:35:32,080
this would I really count this as a low

1808
01:35:32,080 --> 01:35:34,320
I don't

1809
01:35:37,920 --> 01:35:40,960
know no I don't think I

1810
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:43,159
would all right so let's say it's this

1811
01:35:43,159 --> 01:35:47,159
this is so ugly let me actually

1812
01:35:48,119 --> 01:35:51,960
just there you go better so we have this

1813
01:35:51,960 --> 01:35:56,840
swing that's left behind right

1814
01:35:57,520 --> 01:36:01,440
here we said it was what this High

1815
01:36:01,440 --> 01:36:06,679
here no it was down

1816
01:36:06,760 --> 01:36:12,239
up down up down so it was this we have

1817
01:36:12,239 --> 01:36:14,639
this swing here price shifted down and

1818
01:36:14,639 --> 01:36:17,400
broke up above it right

1819
01:36:17,400 --> 01:36:20,880
here let me move this out the way now

1820
01:36:20,880 --> 01:36:24,400
shift the down broke up above

1821
01:36:24,400 --> 01:36:26,239
it right

1822
01:36:26,239 --> 01:36:31,280
here so I'm using Candlestick structure

1823
01:36:31,280 --> 01:36:34,719
to spot a swing in Candlestick

1824
01:36:34,719 --> 01:36:37,560
structure to take for a move

1825
01:36:37,560 --> 01:36:41,840
up so what I'm actually doing

1826
01:36:41,840 --> 01:36:45,560
is I see this larger swing

1827
01:36:45,560 --> 01:36:48,280
here and I could use this larger swing

1828
01:36:48,280 --> 01:36:52,600
as a guide for you know like price

1829
01:36:52,600 --> 01:36:55,639
coming down to at least the 50% so

1830
01:36:55,639 --> 01:36:57,480
that's at least right

1831
01:36:57,480 --> 01:37:01,600
here and within this area of the

1832
01:37:01,600 --> 01:37:04,800
50% I'm looking for an area that price

1833
01:37:04,800 --> 01:37:07,639
could potentially react

1834
01:37:07,639 --> 01:37:10,199
from so I

1835
01:37:10,199 --> 01:37:13,480
have I could actually use this snd here

1836
01:37:13,480 --> 01:37:17,040
this one candle

1837
01:37:17,040 --> 01:37:21,480
here price comes Taps into the 50% of

1838
01:37:21,480 --> 01:37:24,719
this snd

1839
01:37:24,760 --> 01:37:28,199
here and trades higher now that's when

1840
01:37:28,199 --> 01:37:30,679
you know Candlestick structure so I'm

1841
01:37:30,679 --> 01:37:31,960
going to do I'm going to come back and

1842
01:37:31,960 --> 01:37:35,239
do another teaching on using the

1843
01:37:35,239 --> 01:37:38,760
Candlestick swing points but you guys

1844
01:37:38,760 --> 01:37:40,840
need to be you know you guys need to

1845
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:43,760
consider that if you take these swing

1846
01:37:43,760 --> 01:37:46,239
points they'll give you some sort of

1847
01:37:46,239 --> 01:37:49,400
directional bias so with this swing

1848
01:37:49,400 --> 01:37:51,679
Point here this swing down followed by

1849
01:37:51,679 --> 01:37:55,800
this move up I caught this move because

1850
01:37:55,800 --> 01:37:59,760
I saw this 50% of this swing point but

1851
01:37:59,760 --> 01:38:02,800
guess what within the 50% of the Swing

1852
01:38:02,800 --> 01:38:06,159
point if anybody knows the way I trade

1853
01:38:06,159 --> 01:38:08,760
they would see that I'm always telling

1854
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:11,440
people about imbalances we have an

1855
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:14,239
imbalance smack dab in the middle of the

1856
01:38:14,239 --> 01:38:16,440
50% of the Swing

1857
01:38:16,440 --> 01:38:19,639
Point what better IM balance to use than

1858
01:38:19,639 --> 01:38:24,119
that we got our scalp off of it right

1859
01:38:24,119 --> 01:38:27,639
here scalp up off of it we got our

1860
01:38:27,639 --> 01:38:31,080
double bottom for the second touch and

1861
01:38:31,080 --> 01:38:32,639
then we

1862
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:36,480
longed to where we went today and this

1863
01:38:36,480 --> 01:38:39,920
is utilizing the swingo from Market

1864
01:38:39,920 --> 01:38:43,280
open so you can't you can't ask

1865
01:38:43,280 --> 01:38:45,920
questions like you know which swing

1866
01:38:45,920 --> 01:38:47,560
point should I use which swing Point

1867
01:38:47,560 --> 01:38:50,000
shouldn't I use which swing point is

1868
01:38:50,000 --> 01:38:52,320
likely which you got a back test it and

1869
01:38:52,320 --> 01:38:54,599
see how the swing points

1870
01:38:54,599 --> 01:38:58,280
react back test the large swing

1871
01:38:58,280 --> 01:39:03,400
points and the small swing points within

1872
01:39:03,400 --> 01:39:06,199
the large swing points so this is the

1873
01:39:06,199 --> 01:39:09,719
down move right here this that I

1874
01:39:09,719 --> 01:39:12,360
just this is the down

1875
01:39:12,360 --> 01:39:15,239
move

1876
01:39:15,239 --> 01:39:17,199
structurally sorry I don't know why this

1877
01:39:17,199 --> 01:39:20,040
isn't cing this is the down move

1878
01:39:20,040 --> 01:39:23,239
structurally and then we shift it up but

1879
01:39:23,239 --> 01:39:28,880
the real down move the real down move

1880
01:39:28,880 --> 01:39:32,159
within this this area this schematic is

1881
01:39:32,159 --> 01:39:36,159
actually from this high here to this

1882
01:39:36,159 --> 01:39:40,320
low this is the real down move that sent

1883
01:39:40,320 --> 01:39:41,560
price

1884
01:39:41,560 --> 01:39:47,920
up so you're using the larger swing for

1885
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:51,400
direction for possible areas to spot

1886
01:39:51,400 --> 01:39:54,440
your reversals and then you're using the

1887
01:39:54,440 --> 01:40:00,199
inside of that area to lower your

1888
01:40:00,199 --> 01:40:04,599
risk now you have a double confirmation

1889
01:40:04,599 --> 01:40:07,760
already within this area this is

1890
01:40:07,760 --> 01:40:09,560
unmitigated this whole thing is

1891
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:13,000
unmitigated here too and there's some

1892
01:40:13,000 --> 01:40:15,840
imbalance within here or whatever it is

1893
01:40:15,840 --> 01:40:17,719
that could be here that has not been

1894
01:40:17,719 --> 01:40:20,679
tapped into when price gets down to this

1895
01:40:20,679 --> 01:40:22,080
area

1896
01:40:22,080 --> 01:40:24,920
you often see a reaction out of it but

1897
01:40:24,920 --> 01:40:26,360
it doesn't mean that it has to be a

1898
01:40:26,360 --> 01:40:28,040
reaction that breaks the

1899
01:40:28,040 --> 01:40:31,040
high it can just be a reaction back up

1900
01:40:31,040 --> 01:40:33,760
to tap into some area up here because we

1901
01:40:33,760 --> 01:40:36,080
could have hit a supply area up here and

1902
01:40:36,080 --> 01:40:37,719
we know nothing about

1903
01:40:37,719 --> 01:40:40,360
that so this is why understanding where

1904
01:40:40,360 --> 01:40:43,920
you are in structure is important too

1905
01:40:43,920 --> 01:40:45,800
you know so I I hope you guys got

1906
01:40:45,800 --> 01:40:48,800
something out of that you know I that's

1907
01:40:48,800 --> 01:40:52,360
how I started trading and um you know I

1908
01:40:52,360 --> 01:40:54,239
have mentioned to you guys actually

1909
01:40:54,239 --> 01:40:57,280
where uh is it I had mentioned to you

1910
01:40:57,280 --> 01:41:01,520
guys um you know when when I

1911
01:41:01,520 --> 01:41:03,920
first where is it let me see if I could

1912
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,239
find

1913
01:41:16,960 --> 01:41:21,080
it I'm trying to get a bear with me guys

1914
01:41:21,080 --> 01:41:23,480
is right

1915
01:41:23,480 --> 01:41:26,239
here when I first started trading this

1916
01:41:26,239 --> 01:41:29,480
and understanding this these were my

1917
01:41:29,480 --> 01:41:31,639
trades and if you look some of them

1918
01:41:31,639 --> 01:41:33,679
didn't get tapped into this didn't get

1919
01:41:33,679 --> 01:41:37,000
tapped this didn't get tapped this

1920
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:39,360
didn't get tapped here but look at all

1921
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:40,800
of

1922
01:41:40,800 --> 01:41:44,159
this and I told people you don't need

1923
01:41:44,159 --> 01:41:48,760
the left side to trade you only need the

1924
01:41:48,760 --> 01:41:52,119
right if it's trending

1925
01:41:52,119 --> 01:41:55,280
if we got a structural shift you only

1926
01:41:55,280 --> 01:41:57,840
need the right side and look I'm trading

1927
01:41:57,840 --> 01:42:01,239
up and down on this right

1928
01:42:01,239 --> 01:42:04,199
side up and down I'm counter Trend

1929
01:42:04,199 --> 01:42:06,320
trading trading with the

1930
01:42:06,320 --> 01:42:13,639
trend up up up up down up down up here

1931
01:42:13,639 --> 01:42:16,880
up here down here all like back and

1932
01:42:16,880 --> 01:42:18,480
forth

1933
01:42:18,480 --> 01:42:23,040
everywhere because I understood how PR

1934
01:42:23,040 --> 01:42:27,000
moved and you know now you guys kind of

1935
01:42:27,000 --> 01:42:31,360
get an idea of I was using swing

1936
01:42:31,400 --> 01:42:34,239
points and if you use that on those days

1937
01:42:34,239 --> 01:42:37,239
where we have those nice rocking

1938
01:42:37,239 --> 01:42:39,520
pullbacks use those swing points and

1939
01:42:39,520 --> 01:42:41,520
you'll see that you could you know get

1940
01:42:41,520 --> 01:42:43,880
quite a quite a bit of Trades you can

1941
01:42:43,880 --> 01:42:46,119
get involved in quite a bit of Trades if

1942
01:42:46,119 --> 01:42:49,599
you're if you're just utilizing swing

1943
01:42:49,599 --> 01:42:52,080
points I I usually go just like this on

1944
01:42:52,080 --> 01:42:54,080
stream and nobody knows what I'm doing

1945
01:42:54,080 --> 01:42:57,000
but I go just like

1946
01:42:57,560 --> 01:43:01,320
this you know and I I'll place that

1947
01:43:01,320 --> 01:43:04,480
there and most people have no idea and

1948
01:43:04,480 --> 01:43:06,040
then there's like a little tiny swing

1949
01:43:06,040 --> 01:43:08,000
Point within

1950
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:10,679
here and I go okay but this Wick came

1951
01:43:10,679 --> 01:43:13,920
down and came back in so now we have it

1952
01:43:13,920 --> 01:43:17,679
there so we rule this area out and we

1953
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:21,119
have this area if price does come below

1954
01:43:21,119 --> 01:43:22,440
but then we

1955
01:43:22,440 --> 01:43:26,080
see this one candle here is a swing

1956
01:43:26,080 --> 01:43:28,000
Point that's

1957
01:43:28,000 --> 01:43:31,320
unmitigated so we use that zone

1958
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:35,360
there and then we have a larger swing

1959
01:43:35,360 --> 01:43:37,760
Point

1960
01:43:37,760 --> 01:43:41,239
here at this

1961
01:43:42,840 --> 01:43:46,480
area and this is where

1962
01:43:46,480 --> 01:43:50,159
we kind of look at what price may do

1963
01:43:50,159 --> 01:43:52,199
when it comes back to the area and it

1964
01:43:52,199 --> 01:43:55,040
could potentially reject from these

1965
01:43:55,040 --> 01:43:56,800
areas back down and you're only

1966
01:43:56,800 --> 01:43:58,920
utilizing what's on your right side not

1967
01:43:58,920 --> 01:44:01,280
on your

1968
01:44:03,080 --> 01:44:08,480
left and and in in um in times of of

1969
01:44:08,480 --> 01:44:09,960
like high

1970
01:44:09,960 --> 01:44:13,880
volume a rejection like this this is

1971
01:44:13,880 --> 01:44:15,719
like two Pips right now rejection like

1972
01:44:15,719 --> 01:44:18,520
this can be a lot more it could be like

1973
01:44:18,520 --> 01:44:21,520
four 30 40 Pips from a rejection like

1974
01:44:21,520 --> 01:44:23,599
this and who's to say you can't scalp

1975
01:44:23,599 --> 01:44:26,599
that real quick scalping maybe from here

1976
01:44:26,599 --> 01:44:29,239
maybe to the imbalance here which is

1977
01:44:29,239 --> 01:44:31,760
like 30 Pips in the in the New York

1978
01:44:31,760 --> 01:44:33,760
session and from this imbalance back up

1979
01:44:33,760 --> 01:44:36,800
to take this High here and then from

1980
01:44:36,800 --> 01:44:38,440
this area here because this is a swing

1981
01:44:38,440 --> 01:44:39,920
point and we know price comes and Taps

1982
01:44:39,920 --> 01:44:41,400
into the swing points and rejects out

1983
01:44:41,400 --> 01:44:43,440
maybe back to some imbalance

1984
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:45,920
here and then from whatever imbalance or

1985
01:44:45,920 --> 01:44:47,679
from whatever Zone to maybe take the

1986
01:44:47,679 --> 01:44:49,800
highs because these are mitigated

1987
01:44:49,800 --> 01:44:52,080
already so if price trades above this

1988
01:44:52,080 --> 01:44:54,239
area these are previously mitigated

1989
01:44:54,239 --> 01:44:56,639
areas so we know we would be assuming

1990
01:44:56,639 --> 01:44:58,520
the high and that's how you create the

1991
01:44:58,520 --> 01:45:00,639
narrative around utilizing these swing

1992
01:45:00,639 --> 01:45:02,000
points as look at this look at this

1993
01:45:02,000 --> 01:45:06,119
rejection guys swing

1994
01:45:06,119 --> 01:45:09,440
Point that's what I'm saying like I I

1995
01:45:09,440 --> 01:45:12,920
try to stress to people watch what I'm

1996
01:45:12,920 --> 01:45:15,239
talking about like watch the videos that

1997
01:45:15,239 --> 01:45:17,880
I'm teaching with because I'm saying

1998
01:45:17,880 --> 01:45:19,599
things over and over and over and over

1999
01:45:19,599 --> 01:45:21,040
and over and over and over and it's

2000
01:45:21,040 --> 01:45:23,080
right in front of people and a lot of

2001
01:45:23,080 --> 01:45:25,800
the times they miss it because these

2002
01:45:25,800 --> 01:45:28,280
little things that they're just not

2003
01:45:28,280 --> 01:45:30,560
noticing this is right in front of us

2004
01:45:30,560 --> 01:45:32,840
this rejection right here would have

2005
01:45:32,840 --> 01:45:35,679
been a 30 40 pip rejection in the New

2006
01:45:35,679 --> 01:45:38,280
York session I just placed that line

2007
01:45:38,280 --> 01:45:39,560
there and said we get we could get

2008
01:45:39,560 --> 01:45:41,400
rejected

2009
01:45:41,400 --> 01:45:43,840
there and then guess what we could let

2010
01:45:43,840 --> 01:45:46,599
let's say we get rejected here let's say

2011
01:45:46,599 --> 01:45:49,360
we come here we tap here let's say we

2012
01:45:49,360 --> 01:45:51,199
come back to this imbalance

2013
01:45:51,199 --> 01:45:53,480
we come back up here reject out of here

2014
01:45:53,480 --> 01:45:56,400
come back to some area here let's say we

2015
01:45:56,400 --> 01:45:59,360
take the high here we assume up guess

2016
01:45:59,360 --> 01:46:02,280
what come back down to

2017
01:46:02,280 --> 01:46:04,920
here maybe some imbalance here maybe the

2018
01:46:04,920 --> 01:46:09,320
imbalance directly above and

2019
01:46:09,480 --> 01:46:13,639
continue and we are noticing the

2020
01:46:13,639 --> 01:46:17,800
areas that are forming the

2021
01:46:17,800 --> 01:46:20,520
trend forming so let's say we got a

2022
01:46:20,520 --> 01:46:21,679
rejection

2023
01:46:21,679 --> 01:46:25,679
here came back down to here back up to

2024
01:46:25,679 --> 01:46:29,080
here we are looking to the left to give

2025
01:46:29,080 --> 01:46:31,000
us the areas that's providing us with

2026
01:46:31,000 --> 01:46:33,719
the retracement we are looking to the

2027
01:46:33,719 --> 01:46:35,760
right to give us the areas that are

2028
01:46:35,760 --> 01:46:39,719
providing us with the

2029
01:46:40,000 --> 01:46:44,440
continuations and that's how we play the

2030
01:46:44,440 --> 01:46:47,239
zones to the left but the zones to the

2031
01:46:47,239 --> 01:46:48,760
left are meaningless if you don't

2032
01:46:48,760 --> 01:46:51,400
understand structure and if you don't

2033
01:46:51,400 --> 01:46:54,000
understand what Candlestick structure is

2034
01:46:54,000 --> 01:46:55,599
that's why I have Candlestick structure

2035
01:46:55,599 --> 01:46:58,159
in that playlist it's the first video

2036
01:46:58,159 --> 01:47:02,800
that's there it is so very important for

2037
01:47:02,800 --> 01:47:05,199
you to learn Candlestick structure

2038
01:47:05,199 --> 01:47:07,239
because it's the fastest way to get into

2039
01:47:07,239 --> 01:47:10,040
your entry and it's at the earliest time

2040
01:47:10,040 --> 01:47:12,080
that price is Shifting that you can get

2041
01:47:12,080 --> 01:47:14,159
into your entry with candlestick

2042
01:47:14,159 --> 01:47:17,719
structure so you I want you guys to just

2043
01:47:17,719 --> 01:47:20,400
um consider that there's more teaching

2044
01:47:20,400 --> 01:47:22,520
on these swing points because it goes a

2045
01:47:22,520 --> 01:47:26,040
lot more in depth insanely in depth you

2046
01:47:26,040 --> 01:47:27,280
guys might think that you learned

2047
01:47:27,280 --> 01:47:30,080
something today

2048
01:47:30,080 --> 01:47:32,599
boy and girl if there's any girls in

2049
01:47:32,599 --> 01:47:35,639
here you don't know and and anybody else

2050
01:47:35,639 --> 01:47:38,119
who identifies as anything else you know

2051
01:47:38,119 --> 01:47:41,080
you guys don't know you know like it's

2052
01:47:41,080 --> 01:47:46,719
it's wild it goes very very in depth and

2053
01:47:46,719 --> 01:47:49,639
you know I I want you guys to to

2054
01:47:49,639 --> 01:47:52,760
understand how to get involved utilizing

2055
01:47:52,760 --> 01:47:55,360
these areas and all it is is Swing

2056
01:47:55,360 --> 01:47:58,599
points that they're mitigating that's it

2057
01:47:58,599 --> 01:48:01,400
all the are swing points you know so

2058
01:48:01,400 --> 01:48:03,159
it's best to use the 15minute swing

2059
01:48:03,159 --> 01:48:05,840
point or an hourly swing Point as well

2060
01:48:05,840 --> 01:48:09,880
um and more more times than not you get

2061
01:48:09,880 --> 01:48:12,520
reactions from those so let's say we use

2062
01:48:12,520 --> 01:48:14,280
this swing Point here look at this swing

2063
01:48:14,280 --> 01:48:16,480
point I just noticed this but let's see

2064
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:18,520
if it works this swing Point here

2065
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:21,719
remember this Wick we're not using this

2066
01:48:21,719 --> 01:48:27,360
Wick we're using this to this this to

2067
01:48:27,360 --> 01:48:30,920
this swing point this to this look at us

2068
01:48:30,920 --> 01:48:33,199
let's move this

2069
01:48:33,199 --> 01:48:36,639
over what do we

2070
01:48:38,000 --> 01:48:43,679
get from this Wick here to this Wick

2071
01:48:48,920 --> 01:48:52,199
here here

2072
01:48:57,080 --> 01:48:59,920
tap and we make our way

2073
01:48:59,920 --> 01:49:02,760
up when you start to understand how to

2074
01:49:02,760 --> 01:49:04,760
mix and match the Wicks and the swing

2075
01:49:04,760 --> 01:49:07,199
point and all of that other stuff it

2076
01:49:07,199 --> 01:49:11,040
would begin to open up your eyes in

2077
01:49:11,040 --> 01:49:14,960
terms of like so many areas on the chart

2078
01:49:14,960 --> 01:49:16,840
that you could trade from that you had

2079
01:49:16,840 --> 01:49:19,760
no idea and you can just create little

2080
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:22,440
setups from it oh this is a scalp here

2081
01:49:22,440 --> 01:49:24,119
but if it comes back up here and Taps up

2082
01:49:24,119 --> 01:49:26,719
here this is a short to continue but if

2083
01:49:26,719 --> 01:49:28,360
it comes down here and Taps here this is

2084
01:49:28,360 --> 01:49:32,440
the scalp and maybe it comes to

2085
01:49:32,440 --> 01:49:35,400
here and Taps here because this is the

2086
01:49:35,400 --> 01:49:37,280
s& Zone responsible for the structural B

2087
01:49:37,280 --> 01:49:39,000
to the left side maybe it comes in and

2088
01:49:39,000 --> 01:49:41,000
Taps here and gives you a double bottom

2089
01:49:41,000 --> 01:49:42,800
here but look we might have already got

2090
01:49:42,800 --> 01:49:45,320
a tap here so maybe that's why we

2091
01:49:45,320 --> 01:49:47,360
started to flip bullish because we

2092
01:49:47,360 --> 01:49:50,520
tapped into this snd here so now we know

2093
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:52,239
that we're flipping bullish from tapping

2094
01:49:52,239 --> 01:49:55,400
into this snd and we look to get

2095
01:49:55,400 --> 01:49:59,679
involved on the downside now so now what

2096
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:03,280
we're looking for is potential areas for

2097
01:50:03,280 --> 01:50:06,080
price to come back to and give us

2098
01:50:06,080 --> 01:50:07,360
touches

2099
01:50:07,360 --> 01:50:11,400
on with one being

2100
01:50:11,400 --> 01:50:14,760
here you have this one here was this

2101
01:50:14,760 --> 01:50:17,440
mitigated nope you have this one here

2102
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,560
this wasn't mitigated either but price

2103
01:50:19,560 --> 01:50:22,639
just tra above

2104
01:50:23,480 --> 01:50:26,199
it so now you wait for it to come and

2105
01:50:26,199 --> 01:50:29,480
tap back into here now it could come and

2106
01:50:29,480 --> 01:50:32,080
tap into here and continue up it might

2107
01:50:32,080 --> 01:50:34,000
come and tap back into another area

2108
01:50:34,000 --> 01:50:35,920
there and continue up then might tap

2109
01:50:35,920 --> 01:50:37,800
into another area there and then shoot

2110
01:50:37,800 --> 01:50:40,040
up out of

2111
01:50:40,040 --> 01:50:41,960
nowhere and

2112
01:50:41,960 --> 01:50:44,599
then come crashing down to break the

2113
01:50:44,599 --> 01:50:47,360
trend and now we're going downtrend and

2114
01:50:47,360 --> 01:50:49,480
we're hitting the middle of the Swing

2115
01:50:49,480 --> 01:50:50,560
points

2116
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,239
going

2117
01:50:52,239 --> 01:50:54,599
down and this is why understanding

2118
01:50:54,599 --> 01:50:57,719
structure is important because you would

2119
01:50:57,719 --> 01:51:00,320
have an idea of which swingo you're

2120
01:51:00,320 --> 01:51:04,440
using and why you are using that swing

2121
01:51:04,440 --> 01:51:07,400
Point that's why the structure videos

2122
01:51:07,400 --> 01:51:11,119
are very important so this will help you

2123
01:51:11,119 --> 01:51:14,159
but those structure videos will maximize

2124
01:51:14,159 --> 01:51:16,719
your learning I promise you will

2125
01:51:16,719 --> 01:51:18,239
maximize your

2126
01:51:18,239 --> 01:51:23,040
learning you know so yeah it's it's uh

2127
01:51:23,040 --> 01:51:25,639
it's crazy let me let me go through some

2128
01:51:25,639 --> 01:51:28,239
of this too um stop loss below the wick

2129
01:51:28,239 --> 01:51:29,679
would be safe yeah because they're not

2130
01:51:29,679 --> 01:51:30,920
returning back there they're not

2131
01:51:30,920 --> 01:51:33,440
bringing people back to break even

2132
01:51:33,440 --> 01:51:34,920
they're trying to get them out shake

2133
01:51:34,920 --> 01:51:37,119
them out they're not giving them back

2134
01:51:37,119 --> 01:51:38,480
that they they're going to at least

2135
01:51:38,480 --> 01:51:41,000
bring them to some area of loss they

2136
01:51:41,000 --> 01:51:42,840
might have been able to hold to but

2137
01:51:42,840 --> 01:51:45,520
they're not taking them back to to their

2138
01:51:45,520 --> 01:51:48,280
Break Even they manipulated that area so

2139
01:51:48,280 --> 01:51:50,560
they usually just test

2140
01:51:50,560 --> 01:51:53,079
the the body of the candle that

2141
01:51:53,079 --> 01:51:55,840
manipulated the area they don't test the

2142
01:51:55,840 --> 01:51:57,719
wick or go below the bottom of the wick

2143
01:51:57,719 --> 01:51:58,840
because that's the area they used to

2144
01:51:58,840 --> 01:52:00,199
shake people

2145
01:52:00,199 --> 01:52:04,880
out um yeah I have friend that only

2146
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:07,960
trades based on ISR confirmations or

2147
01:52:07,960 --> 01:52:11,159
Divergence uh they called me sometime

2148
01:52:11,159 --> 01:52:14,079
they wait to take they wait long

2149
01:52:14,079 --> 01:52:16,840
time to make a good trade but it's a lot

2150
01:52:16,840 --> 01:52:18,599
of money to trade

2151
01:52:18,599 --> 01:52:20,639
left it

2152
01:52:20,639 --> 01:52:23,760
behind in between yeah I mean you know

2153
01:52:23,760 --> 01:52:25,719
like people utilize their own systems

2154
01:52:25,719 --> 01:52:27,560
and they have their own risk involved

2155
01:52:27,560 --> 01:52:29,920
and and they make money yes but we're

2156
01:52:29,920 --> 01:52:33,639
talking about like being able to make

2157
01:52:33,639 --> 01:52:36,440
you know an upen amount of money and

2158
01:52:36,440 --> 01:52:38,960
also be very very accurate with it so

2159
01:52:38,960 --> 01:52:40,400
you see guys see how I said we tapped

2160
01:52:40,400 --> 01:52:42,480
into a bullish area and we would end up

2161
01:52:42,480 --> 01:52:44,760
going bullish I said that all of this up

2162
01:52:44,760 --> 01:52:46,440
here was already mitigated so we would

2163
01:52:46,440 --> 01:52:49,000
end up going through the area and I said

2164
01:52:49,000 --> 01:52:50,239
that there could be a poti potential

2165
01:52:50,239 --> 01:52:52,800
rejection here back down but then we

2166
01:52:52,800 --> 01:52:54,840
could still end up just taking the high

2167
01:52:54,840 --> 01:52:58,000
above so you would just look for the

2168
01:52:58,000 --> 01:53:01,400
first the rejection

2169
01:53:01,800 --> 01:53:04,480
there you know at this area and it can

2170
01:53:04,480 --> 01:53:06,440
just be like a momentary rejection

2171
01:53:06,440 --> 01:53:09,440
something quick something short you know

2172
01:53:09,440 --> 01:53:11,960
um and then you can get a run of the

2173
01:53:11,960 --> 01:53:14,040
high after but it's all because we

2174
01:53:14,040 --> 01:53:16,239
tapped into the bullish area responsible

2175
01:53:16,239 --> 01:53:19,040
for the structural break so that's how

2176
01:53:19,040 --> 01:53:20,880
we understand that so if we knew that

2177
01:53:20,880 --> 01:53:23,520
and we saw this pushing up this could

2178
01:53:23,520 --> 01:53:25,560
have been an a scalp on a New York

2179
01:53:25,560 --> 01:53:27,280
session just taking that little short

2180
01:53:27,280 --> 01:53:30,960
move there could be like 50 60 Pips you

2181
01:53:30,960 --> 01:53:33,000
know just understanding that oh we're

2182
01:53:33,000 --> 01:53:34,920
about to run this whole area because all

2183
01:53:34,920 --> 01:53:37,280
of this is mitigated already lunch meat

2184
01:53:37,280 --> 01:53:41,079
right here you know so that's like

2185
01:53:41,079 --> 01:53:44,040
noticing those things to the side and

2186
01:53:44,040 --> 01:53:48,079
and finding ways to to you like stay out

2187
01:53:48,079 --> 01:53:52,440
of certain um snd zones comes from

2188
01:53:52,440 --> 01:53:54,440
utilizing these swing

2189
01:53:54,440 --> 01:53:57,599
points because most people you might

2190
01:53:57,599 --> 01:54:00,480
have somebody who has this snd Zone

2191
01:54:00,480 --> 01:54:04,159
here why are we not using this snd Zone

2192
01:54:04,159 --> 01:54:07,159
here because if you move it down to

2193
01:54:07,159 --> 01:54:08,920
where this swing

2194
01:54:08,920 --> 01:54:10,679
is

2195
01:54:10,679 --> 01:54:13,840
here price already mitigated it at this

2196
01:54:13,840 --> 01:54:15,040
candle

2197
01:54:15,040 --> 01:54:18,719
here we already got mitigated this swing

2198
01:54:18,719 --> 01:54:20,239
already got mitigated

2199
01:54:20,239 --> 01:54:22,719
so when price comes back up here most

2200
01:54:22,719 --> 01:54:25,040
dummies are waiting here for an order

2201
01:54:25,040 --> 01:54:27,400
block to be tapped into and price shifts

2202
01:54:27,400 --> 01:54:29,520
down

2203
01:54:29,520 --> 01:54:32,040
but it's the move that they're coming

2204
01:54:32,040 --> 01:54:34,239
back

2205
01:54:34,760 --> 01:54:37,760
to shifted down came back up tapped into

2206
01:54:37,760 --> 01:54:40,679
it left this whole swing is mitigated no

2207
01:54:40,679 --> 01:54:44,280
matter if this order block is up here

2208
01:54:44,280 --> 01:54:48,679
unmitigated the swing is mitigated

2209
01:54:48,679 --> 01:54:50,520
already

2210
01:54:50,520 --> 01:54:54,920
so you know price is going past this

2211
01:54:55,320 --> 01:54:58,040
area and then we end up taking the highs

2212
01:54:58,040 --> 01:55:00,040
these are equal highs right

2213
01:55:00,040 --> 01:55:03,760
here equal highs get ran later equal

2214
01:55:03,760 --> 01:55:05,520
highs run the low yes but when it

2215
01:55:05,520 --> 01:55:07,960
returns to it it runs

2216
01:55:07,960 --> 01:55:12,920
it based on what area of structure it's

2217
01:55:12,920 --> 01:55:16,480
in so we run this High We tap up into

2218
01:55:16,480 --> 01:55:18,119
this is the second tap of an imbalance

2219
01:55:18,119 --> 01:55:20,800
to the left so we all know that this is

2220
01:55:20,800 --> 01:55:22,840
usually just a retracement back down and

2221
01:55:22,840 --> 01:55:24,960
then we go through the area so now

2222
01:55:24,960 --> 01:55:27,880
noticing that that we're rejecting from

2223
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:29,280
here we know that it's just a

2224
01:55:29,280 --> 01:55:31,679
retracement down maybe into some

2225
01:55:31,679 --> 01:55:33,880
imbalance here maybe into some sndas

2226
01:55:33,880 --> 01:55:35,639
down here but then we know we're going

2227
01:55:35,639 --> 01:55:38,760
to trade higher because this is just the

2228
01:55:38,760 --> 01:55:41,360
second tap of an imbalance to the left

2229
01:55:41,360 --> 01:55:43,679
and it already took out the high of the

2230
01:55:43,679 --> 01:55:46,760
area here so we get the retracement down

2231
01:55:46,760 --> 01:55:48,840
then we come back up above the area and

2232
01:55:48,840 --> 01:55:50,719
do we get reject Ed from an imbalance

2233
01:55:50,719 --> 01:55:53,320
here right here maybe who knows we'll

2234
01:55:53,320 --> 01:55:54,800
see what price does when it gets up

2235
01:55:54,800 --> 01:55:57,119
there but we have it we're pegging for

2236
01:55:57,119 --> 01:55:59,679
it to run this high but if it doesn't

2237
01:55:59,679 --> 01:56:02,079
run this High that's okay we'll adjust

2238
01:56:02,079 --> 01:56:03,400
our

2239
01:56:03,400 --> 01:56:06,400
bias and that's how you know like this

2240
01:56:06,400 --> 01:56:11,400
all kind of um works together you know

2241
01:56:11,400 --> 01:56:13,800
for for everybody to kind of understand

2242
01:56:13,800 --> 01:56:18,520
I hope you guys are you know holy

2243
01:56:18,520 --> 01:56:21,679
effing uh yeah I say some of you guys

2244
01:56:21,679 --> 01:56:25,560
are are understanding um you know what

2245
01:56:25,560 --> 01:56:28,239
what I'm saying right now

2246
01:56:28,239 --> 01:56:30,119
um let me

2247
01:56:30,119 --> 01:56:33,360
see oh oh AE said he wants to touch on

2248
01:56:33,360 --> 01:56:36,560
that example when when I'm done um

2249
01:56:36,560 --> 01:56:38,000
anytime this happens it's price always

2250
01:56:38,000 --> 01:56:40,280
going to take out the highs that were

2251
01:56:40,280 --> 01:56:44,239
created um it just depends I mean if if

2252
01:56:44,239 --> 01:56:45,960
we have this low put in and we're

2253
01:56:45,960 --> 01:56:48,199
breaking structure to the top side if

2254
01:56:48,199 --> 01:56:51,719
price doesn't take out this High here

2255
01:56:51,719 --> 01:56:53,719
and we get a rejection from up here the

2256
01:56:53,719 --> 01:56:56,719
rejection is usually like you know you

2257
01:56:56,719 --> 01:56:59,679
you'll see it like

2258
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:03,280
this we get a rejection out of there and

2259
01:57:03,280 --> 01:57:05,159
you see it's heading back down if we're

2260
01:57:05,159 --> 01:57:07,840
heading back down and we don't like

2261
01:57:07,840 --> 01:57:10,719
create a flip

2262
01:57:10,719 --> 01:57:13,159
here if we don't create that flip here

2263
01:57:13,159 --> 01:57:15,480
and begin to wake up make our way back

2264
01:57:15,480 --> 01:57:19,199
up this is being ran and often times

2265
01:57:19,199 --> 01:57:22,679
this will get ran coming back down to

2266
01:57:22,679 --> 01:57:26,000
this area often times this will get ran

2267
01:57:26,000 --> 01:57:29,679
because it would be a weak low if failed

2268
01:57:29,679 --> 01:57:32,320
to put in a new high this is the lowest

2269
01:57:32,320 --> 01:57:36,520
point here and price is banking on this

2270
01:57:36,520 --> 01:57:40,079
point to be strong enough to Deliver

2271
01:57:40,079 --> 01:57:42,960
Us from Eva no just kidding Deliver us

2272
01:57:42,960 --> 01:57:44,679
into a new

2273
01:57:44,679 --> 01:57:47,560
high and we would end up

2274
01:57:47,560 --> 01:57:49,880
delivering and this would valid validate

2275
01:57:49,880 --> 01:57:53,679
this low right here but if we get caught

2276
01:57:53,679 --> 01:57:56,719
up here and we begin to short from the

2277
01:57:56,719 --> 01:57:59,639
area and we break structural lows on

2278
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:02,639
this trend we break structural lows if

2279
01:58:02,639 --> 01:58:05,000
we break structural lows you better

2280
01:58:05,000 --> 01:58:07,480
believe that we would be coming back

2281
01:58:07,480 --> 01:58:10,440
down to liquidate the area and continue

2282
01:58:10,440 --> 01:58:12,920
lower but when you back test this and

2283
01:58:12,920 --> 01:58:15,520
you see it enough you would be able to

2284
01:58:15,520 --> 01:58:18,159
make certain decisions in real time on

2285
01:58:18,159 --> 01:58:20,159
how you can engage into the market and

2286
01:58:20,159 --> 01:58:23,199
what system based on your personality

2287
01:58:23,199 --> 01:58:28,639
can also you know like like create that
