游릭  Previous Days, we have speed movement in London Open Session. 
    So, Today is not supposed to have the same speed in London Session

游릭 instead of forcing myself to find a setup in NYAM session, 
    it was better to analyze price at SOC and find IFC, DOB, EOB, LQD.

 - Why it is not supposed for price to go below this low !? 游댮
 - Maybe, this is the leg who makes BOS-leg
 - Maybe, this is the leg after the IDM-leg who makes the Strong Low 
 - So, the OB inside the BOS-leg is our POI for entry

游릭 before High Impact New Day it is not a good day  for trade? Why !? making setup
游댮 don't force a trade-setup
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/hbTv42sZ/] 1. Gold reaches to HTF objectives and enter the consolidation state 
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/RD3ssDOb/] 2.  DXY time to enter expansion, especially HTF objective (DVIB) not meet yet.
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/d3BGxFix/] 3. EURGBP tells us which one is better for SHORT (EUR or GBP) !? 
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/II6uOKkC/] 4. EUR is weaker, So it has a better performance on SHORT. 
[https://www.tradingview.com/x/2HuZ4HT2/] 5. GBP has a better and clearer setup for SHORT. (Respecting -OF, clear EQL)
